this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as New York Times reporter .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published more spectacular that the NSA has interc@@ epted illeg@@ ally tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a dis@@ astro@@ us U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally sur@@ rendered to Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became the symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they will not protect them . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous rep@@ orters were already doing before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although it was essential for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cracks . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the rep@@ orters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
&quot; instead of failing and bringing tears to the statements , it might also be possible to do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , are secre@@ tly worried about his phone inquiry , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit information , and even travel links with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey sterling , CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers in his attempt to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has always more possibilities to spy out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of Rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can do that from the moment where they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that didn &apos;t exist when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source re@@ mitt@@ ance system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by us Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and today has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any common contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are encryp@@ ted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secre@@ tly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outs@@ et . &quot;
&quot; however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that all end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to ensure that not only technology partners such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to kill mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; the report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market . key Regions • Americas , AP@@ AC , EMEA , and AP@@ AC &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our rights of all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; huge sums of money are hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has re@@ signed .
there is also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s letter box companies are in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous c@@ elli@@ st . &quot;
&quot; now , there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others who are nervous on the next release , and on the next documents revealed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it seems we@@ pt away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we tackle this ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide their assets and disgu@@ ise -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine a mat@@ ri@@ o@@ idal cap@@ ri@@ cle .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these don@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is happening . &quot;
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the United States .
&quot; probably because there has been no prominent Americans , who came forward in these revel@@ ations , this scandal . &quot;
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to set up less information in order to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ visibility in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
&quot; - Qu@@ otation marks , if any , have to be entered exactly in the same position . &quot;
it is this kind of behaviour that affects us all .
here in Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this in practice looks like .
how does that work ?

&quot; our investig@@ ator called himself an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked that everyone was up to a lawyer to our investig@@ ators as he could transfer his money .
&quot; these were all preliminary meetings . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , who has broad@@ ened our cover@@ t investig@@ ative proposals . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single top poli@@ tic@@ ist , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this type of behaviour more difficult .
&quot; this may sound very stub@@ born as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the last few years , we have seen above @-@ levels to more transparency , as far as the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the theme was given political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU regi@@ sters in central regi@@ sters at a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is back here .

&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us in Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes . &quot;
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies .
we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem , and use laws to end this kind of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally end the transparency , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; a day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace scor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he loved me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a place to sleep now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace circles , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to go ab@@ duc@@ ted in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; then I heard saying , &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; ä@@ h , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what have I lost ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I stepped out of the bed , at to@@ es at the door , and closed my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the work of art , which he had bought from me , hang@@ s in his classroom . he is now teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as stran@@ gers actually were friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ under@@ ed , my ro@@ omm@@ ate moves out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . &quot;
Ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded as &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot;
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes are completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
did we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into the rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ cher@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
&quot; in this way , we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a web site , posting public pictures of their private spaces , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed , when visiting . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite wild foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the missile to ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
&quot; because we have learned as children , stran@@ gers are dangerous . &quot;
&quot; if you have a problem , you think about things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the art academy , we learned that design is much more than just look and hap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence through design , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of confidence we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to lock your mobile phone .
enter your barrier @-@ free mobile phone to your left seat neighbour .
this quiet outing of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your text , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone from a stranger in his hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
&quot; this way , most guests feel when they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; by Andrzej On September 3 , 2011 &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor would have imagined his name , if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are hot ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you have 150 assessments , all of which say : &quot; &quot; he can really capture very well un@@ locked phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
&quot; for a well @-@ through feedback system , confidence is decisive . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , we have made some things wrong . &quot;
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed out their jud@@ gements before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and residence .
little surprisingly we trust most people who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation har@@ ms common@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; if you are told too little , such as &quot; Hi ! &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; T@@ olle Art@@ works in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards stran@@ gers .
&quot; what we did not expect , was the great deal of people who were more than willing to take these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people use our offer .
you can recognize three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
thir@@ dly : a need that had not been covered before .
&quot; for us , the business runs very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate or rent apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; I stood at the front , when confidence was broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , there was only a fra@@ ction of the 123 million overnight stays . &quot;
for people trusted each other to be right .
&quot; when trust works , it can develop wonderful things . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers , who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who can save life even though they don &apos;t know it properly .
&quot; you drive one in your own car into the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they pass books . &quot;
you can stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is running . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled across this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing coinci@@ de with money transactions ?
it &apos;s about an economic trade .
&quot; but now simply to call the &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not just right . &quot;
share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill out a thorough filling and to show one at a pub in the neighborhood , of which one has never heard of . &quot;
or if you could learn about cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would make apartments of reason to share with each other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of joint participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
&quot; students , who were looking for a lead , were now offered . &quot;
&quot; there were inc@@ ub@@ ator programmes were initiated , and inc@@ ub@@ ator programmes were launched , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people will be guest in 191 countries with a stranger or even host . &quot;
the idea seems not to be so crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 2 ) 1,9@@ 41 171 &quot;
there have been similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I think it &apos;s amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time when a red Mazda is passing by me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , subjected to bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ? &quot;
or just a delay at the airport safety check .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans believe that most people would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a car@@ rot @-@ eg@@ s @-@ fitness fan@@ atics , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , Baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided to make a decision .
&quot; when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten myself . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I chose Hi@@ j@@ ab to wear my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a feminist Declaration of Independence , which I felt as a 17 year old , to adapt to a perfect and im@@ meas@@ urable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not just adopted the faith of my parents .
I have led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read him , thought , posed in question , dou@@ b@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Koran .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to cry .
I know myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands you and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyp@@ tians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Express . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock turned into rebel@@ lion fast .
why should I do something ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard , &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u , the actions of others turned into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and start building up . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I rode -- when we went silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; Be careful , &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t blame you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then it was Friday at that week -- the day , in which Muslims gather to pray . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; not this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a target . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or of people who held for Muslims , sm@@ ashed and sm@@ ashed . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
because the people who attacked this land have attacked our country .
I have got the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly declare itself .
&quot; I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
&quot; they speak of my church , like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA . &quot;
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , not tum@@ our in the USA &apos;s body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , test@@ ers and Olymp@@ ion@@ es . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; it might be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror . &quot;
regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to more toler@@ ant people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater citizen participation .
&quot; and like me a head of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one noticed that it starts online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ hor@@ red their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establish@@ es its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I think we must do everything to stop a group like IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups asser@@ t their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you look at them , they do not drive on what they read in their &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality they can read these things into Scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; nothing inspi@@ res and something that had made sense of her anger , she was a prime target for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m turned the connection to God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she kept her close to the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our thought of thought ? &quot;
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear it will happen at least three things .
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if you submit a message to test persons in which negative about Muslims was reported , they agree more military attacks on Muslim lands and the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic issue .
&quot; if you look at the mood against Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction of Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; in fact , it can be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to extract the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we feel it perhaps the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; in order to as@@ sign collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Ch@@ apel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was at the Dental Medical Fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when did such a young man become such a young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had been visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after he had posted utter@@ ances against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;

&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also deadly . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America would leave our children : one thing that would be controlled by fear or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat we went silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and went out my shoes , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me go . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Imam did an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I was broken down . &quot;
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , working in a noble thinking factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I &apos;m not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am not an exception in any way .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .

&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air p@@ act placement into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRA@@ C Centre has built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with ro@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting flights , flight machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build up @-@ to @-@ charge load@@ able structures .
&quot; they have learned to wear bur@@ dens , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the borders of the car@@ rot in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be coll@@ ectively aware of where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our lab at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; External commands are available on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flying device that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the for@@ wards flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping side . &quot;
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind b@@ ushes .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in what position the optimal position is achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often face basic abstract questions leading to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of mov@@ able parts that meet to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled flying devices that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
we discovered that flying with just one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ an , the mechan@@ ically simple remote operated flight unit . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no brackets , hing@@ es and trans@@ formers , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it &apos;s simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in space . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the flying , I have to throw it correctly . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right , if I watch all , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ an is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ directional with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess . &quot;
what to do with all this out@@ flow ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
this is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; in this way , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is shot or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight pro@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; a lot is possible in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see this .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must become extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
this is turning clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; if you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , if also restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration investigates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units enables a palette of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we acquired commercial micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weigh@@ s less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully they motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to re@@ consider new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; on Broadway , the particularly secure machine would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , wages are in development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , intelligent creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; over 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far distant gal@@ ax@@ y orbit@@ ing each other faster , and they transformed the mass of three sun@@ shades into pure energy . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , it lighten@@ ed more bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the universe known universe . &quot;
it was a very big boy .
&quot; however , their energy did not put them freely in the form of light -- &quot;
&quot; finally , we speak of black holes . &quot;
the whole energy was handed over into space @-@ time and the universe exploded into gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; at first , we arrange the events . &quot;
ISO @-@ ir @-@ 111 ( Cyrillic KO@@ I @-@ 8 ) mac@@ intosh ( Mac@@ Roman )
&quot; since then , the earth has produced a lot : coral , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; approximately 25 years ago , a group decided to build a huge laser detector from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise about colon@@ izing black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector LI@@ GO : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of the LI@@ GO was significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is called Advanced LI@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO launched a last test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after commission@@ ing the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes caused through the earth . &quot;
&quot; they went through you and me , &quot;
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
mystery of the An@@ ci@@ ents : Lock@@ wood Manor
and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; in essence , the fruits of my life were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theore@@ tic physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their observ@@ atories like LI@@ GO . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a strengthening of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its contents are stretched in one direction and st@@ out into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illu@@ stra@@ tive , lect@@ urers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a real alpine dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and du@@ ke , stretch and du@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched by us during the meeting of the waves . the expansion of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ o , described the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to LI@@ GO . Scott asser@@ ts that LI@@ GO is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite convenient . for instance , you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; in killing , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean you a lot : &quot;
the face of your child is about .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties like pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob is inter@@ rup@@ ting them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same is true for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot create simple images of objects in the space with them .
&quot; but by watching changes in ampli@@ tude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
&quot; at least , for LI@@ GO , the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range . &quot;
&quot; so when we transform wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gra@@ vit@@ ation , a lot about the collision between two black holes can tell us about the collision between two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just like : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u
&quot; it is a kind of movement wor@@ ding , em@@ bos@@ sed into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forgot -- I heard the following : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ der noise &#93; No one who knows what to hear , see this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate about as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the den@@ ser body in space , one with a mass of 29 son@@ ars , the other with a mass of 36 sun , revol@@ ve a hundred times a second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
there is the lasting meaning of LI@@ GO .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it never was possible before .
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the All @-@ listen and the invisible . &quot;
&quot; in all , we can &apos;t see -- practical or basically -- not to be seen . &quot;
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes take place in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through since these are opaque .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I &apos;m optimistic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see , and of whom we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found things that we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , as LI@@ GO watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the sour cher@@ ries for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us a completely different view of the events in the space , on the emergence of the stars and finally , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as brave as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the universe . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and All .
what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Ur@@ ge yourself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for a year I would say &quot; yes , &quot; before I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , bringing me into unpleasant situations , I forced to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I have to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : just doing what I feared , I removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to keep speeches , my social anxiety -- coming away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected item . it began with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
&quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
( users Viewing this Forum : 0 ) 1 1
&quot; no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family . &quot;
but it also has an ast@@ oun@@ ding side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; saw to play my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things , stir up your life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce TV .
&quot; I &apos;m doing television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV @-@ season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours television . three to four shows simultaneously are in production . &quot;
every shipment has hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series runs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programmes that I created myself , and not only produced , so on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing it ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
&quot; I say , because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say to you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household to take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I am not just sitting around on the computer and more imagin@@ able , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it doesn &apos;t work with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; if I am deeply involved in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is , as I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a high sound , running a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clinical and mat@@ ernal , cruel and rational . and the best of it is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like an animated street , I could go for always on her . &quot;
&quot; many people take up when I explain to them the sums that I speak about writing , that writing gave me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I began to work and work , build , create , and work together , I discovered this thing , this sw@@ amp , this energy . the sums ! &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the sums are music . the sums are light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you can &apos;t strive for great@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , not to be different compared to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I &apos;m not for failure , and I only know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; in order to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casts , the more broad@@ ened borders , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more I am writing history , the more I am writing history . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I am creating , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high note , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sums .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then the sums stopped .
&quot; over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burned out . &quot;
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the truth that her mom@@ my is a single work stit@@ ch .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ anic .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums ceased . &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my bu@@ zz@@ ing was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , not deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , is not up , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect titanium .
&quot; I was a show @-@ titanium , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sw@@ amp and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
&quot; so what do you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; Today , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but you know you do , you do it you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother to be a painter , Bill Gates , one loves another and that gives one of the sums , when one knows the sums , when the sums are stopped , who is then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
I &apos;m still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way outside , late and she says : &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I will say no , when two things are aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , it didn &apos;t call me &quot; valuation . &quot; &quot;
it does not call no more &quot; valuation . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my bu@@ zz@@ ing , and here everything changes from my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come together , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of the bu@@ zz , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
&quot; the land which I am creating , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high note - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax pins and the song in which it comes to letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The Queen of Ice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe I &apos;m at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magic secret .
but let us stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the title of the Tit@@ anic , which is only the substitute . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself , I have forgotten what the real sums are . &quot;
the sums are no strength and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ ming depends on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the river that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums ignore the pressure of history , the tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ m is simple and original .
&quot; the real sw@@ amp is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it &apos;s just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I don &apos;t have any other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I &apos;m better at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this con@@ fession is painful , for what kind of person is better to be than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; OK , now I just want BF1918 / 2 . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we swi@@ ms around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play Ball .
we broke down soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I mainly feel sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always take my mobile phone .
but it &apos;s ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever heard of the games ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wishes to play with you .
maybe you &apos;ll hold me for nai@@ ve for a day@@ dreaming .
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones don &apos;t want to play at least 15 minutes with me until they think they want to do something else .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , I replaced a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit . &quot;
&quot; and speak my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am Mother of the Year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more need not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can get 15 minutes per piece , even on a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes per piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
the day is short : dinner that makes children ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are included !
&quot; my children are my feel@@ good , my world . I don &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the sums , to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
to play &quot; in general .
treat yourself in the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why not indul@@ ge in a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seem to return if I &apos;m not working .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sums , the sums are not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , d@@ inners with friends . &quot;
this is now my bu@@ zz@@ iness .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work are part of me , but just one part . I am so grateful . &quot;
it &apos;s snow@@ ing me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan that plays travel to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my bon@@ fires are burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clearly my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz@@ ing , the more it makes this unusual , be@@ aming , naked and new sense of life in me . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly that sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think things , I stir you to life . &quot;
this is part of the job that means living his dream .
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; in this way , an electro@@ de impl@@ anted deeply in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered under severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; at the time , I was conducting senior doctor and worked day and night in emergency . &quot;
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a increases the brain and increases skull pressure .
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the skull pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , you sometimes have to remove a part of a s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean with that ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is not a easy task .
&quot; it is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed . &quot;
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you are still aware of the biology course that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small no@@ ises of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
&quot; they never die , they are imm@@ ortal . &quot;
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they origin@@ ate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain drain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fo@@ etus it is responsible for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so secure . &quot;
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells , as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and they then mark color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we rei@@ m@@ pl@@ emented it at the entrance of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we pl@@ anting these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we pl@@ anting the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller &apos;s help , we could work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely disappeared as if they were removed , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we fed an injury and pl@@ agu@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells survived -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were irrit@@ ated .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small dots . these are the cells that we in vitro , dy@@ ed in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we couldn &apos;t stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food p@@ ellets from a tray .
that made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we injured in the motor c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they spont@@ ane@@ ously recre@@ ated themselves up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at a certain level , just as with the ap@@ es . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , they see the monkeys that spont@@ ane@@ ously recovered . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from the injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we pl@@ agu@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after the m@@ plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use it in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant it with people .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
= = = &gt; Kapp@@ a = = = &gt; Bul@@ k@@ head
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest hind@@ ran@@ ces are before you can begin clinical studies . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to see the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to carry out treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ centr@@ alised study . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit to TED and that you have told us of it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable fact .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that &apos;s not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ers in Beijing proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ mistak@@ ably declared to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my dar@@ ing friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ sible democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are m@@ owed , our future dark@@ ened and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; I call it &quot; &quot; twin peaks parad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unt@@ apped cash , which is part of the assets and corporations which are too scared to invest in where it would be productive and to produce income with which one could produce the debt mountain and produce all the things that humanity needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and the Eurozone , 3.4 tri@@ llion US dollars were invested in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ llion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until you compare it with the 5.1 tri@@ llion dollar spent at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks which cannot be compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds employed in the United States , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low demand that they do not invest in . &quot;
&quot; un@@ inten@@ tionally , the circumstances bring about the fact that O@@ edi@@ pus kills him . &quot;
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; his exce@@ ed@@ ingly extravag@@ ant art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially fund all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to the rescue of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ otel@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 2 ) 1,9@@ 41 171 &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy based on these conclusions . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ making at the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they give them the right to political participation with the same degree of voice in questions of the government . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy has not been kept long .
&quot; like a candle that lights up very bright , it is burned too quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy came first , as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- was a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our modern democra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place , and the economy gradually under@@ went politics and unle@@ ashed it . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because you can now be in the government today , yet not in power , because power is det@@ ri@@ mental from politics to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a flock of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably die the animals from which it feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated , that they are star@@ ved at the end . &quot;
&quot; in a similar way , it is with the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ fied the policy that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; Dem@@ os , &quot; the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
&quot; the Marxist Left had already had this idea a hundred years ago , and it was not very good . &quot;
&quot; the teaching from the de@@ acon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only be restored through a miracle , as in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by autom@@ ating and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separated areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste has become more prosper@@ ous , and social conflicts are deeper , as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democra@@ ti@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we will be able to democra@@ ti@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that is similar to the company in &quot; Star Trek , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; - Carl S@@ agan &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : ask a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; no longer between capital and labor , no big gaps between capital and labor , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately there are no temporary tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a freely sw@@ aying exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all mankind . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a mutual fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Brett@@ on W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time they didn &apos;t have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ated individuals , and Marxist , because it is buried by the separation of capital and labour in the poor@@ est of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world ?
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which states Larry Sum@@ mers as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transfer@@ ring this crisis from part of the Earth to the next one as we are currently experiencing it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am totally confused . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are well too . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ v : if you don &apos;t mess up , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ v : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think from the view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal democra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy to politics , while the area where most of it takes place -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I must say that provoc@@ ative , China is similar to the Great Britain of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically . &quot;
&quot; ( to create paragraphs , you simply leave blank lines . ) &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what we can now observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , sm@@ ashed out of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I told you that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; to say goodbye to the self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the constant denial that a massive exp@@ ul@@ sion line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be mas@@ sively threatened by the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , will continue to be elected . &quot;
but you know what comes to come .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it may be hes@@ it@@ ant for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has no mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I thought that there was an honest interest in the parties of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the wor@@ ries going through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a dis@@ astro@@ us program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the tro@@ ika bank@@ ers who imposed this policy stood up : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake .
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone has not survived .
&quot; for if they do not survive , they will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be catastro@@ phic for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will be equally bear@@ able to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for taking you to TED . &quot;
Y@@ v : thank you .
&quot; we have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;

America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the assessment division of more than 2,500 TV series on the website . &quot;
&quot; if your show is rated at nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , are shows like &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has more thoughts about the medium balancing , the average television -- the shows that aren &apos;t good or bad , they just don &apos;t im@@ press them . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is there , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price wants nothing to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;

they are observed by Roy and his team that record everything .
&quot; you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you want to ski@@ p or check again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon ought to make a sit@@ com via four Republican U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- i.e. something above the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; as they had all the parts together , they entered a car and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
&quot; you have two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect million data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
you are optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the Min@@ de@@ box , what you can expect , is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , it &apos;s a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we are able to grasp more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions , far beyond the television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software .
&quot; if someone is in prison in the US and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is prob@@ able that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is done or not . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results . this is not because a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; yes , even Google does sometimes make mistakes . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fla@@ w@@ lessly , year by year , until it didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ voc@@ ation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data stream into decisions of life -- at work , in the law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people can use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy . &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some pattern of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the details ; as a branch , you set the items together to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and intelligence , where they are also involved in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , which they otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before it was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in hind@@ sight to the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more cl@@ oned , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I think this as a very encouraging message , that despite the large amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions to be an expert in what you do and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
