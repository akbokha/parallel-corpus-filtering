<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published more spectacular that the NSA has intercepted illegally telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a disastrous U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally surrendered to Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has identified Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became the symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and spy journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they will not protect them."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters were already doing before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although it was essential for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and bringing tears to the statements, it might also be possible to do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, are secretly worried about his phone inquiry,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit information, and even travel links with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistle-blowers in his attempt to protect whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has always more possibilities to spy out all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of Reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can do that from the moment where they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that didn't exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source remittance system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by us Aaron Swartz, and today has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any common contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that all endanger us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to ensure that not only technology partners such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to kill misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. key Regions â€¢ Americas, APAC, EMEA, and APAC"</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our rights of all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[what does that mean?] [the" Panama Papers "reveal that rich and powerful] [huge sums of money are hidden in tax havens] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mossack Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's letter box companies are in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now, there will be a lot of richer people and others who are nervous on the next release, and on the next documents revealed."</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems wept away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tackle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide their assets and disguise -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a matrioidal capricle.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these donors."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is happening."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because there has been no prominent Americans, who came forward in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to set up less information in order to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of invisibility in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">"- Quotation marks, if any, have to be entered exactly in the same position."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behaviour that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here in Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this in practice looks like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator called himself an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that everyone was up to a lawyer to our investigators as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all preliminary meetings. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, who has broadened our covert investigative proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top politicist, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this type of behaviour more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very stubborn as if we could not do anything about it, as if nothing ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the last few years, we have seen above-levels to more transparency, as far as the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme was given political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU registers in central registers at a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is back here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer Firm of the Year for Insolvency Administration Schneider Geiwitz & Partner Firm of the Year for Tax Gleiss Lutz Firm of the Year for White Collar Crime</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us in Global Witness, this is a moment for changes."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem, and use laws to end this kind of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the transparency, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he loved me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where are you sleeping tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse:" "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a place to sleep now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace circles, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to go abducted in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard saying," "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "Ã¤h, as please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what have I lost?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I stepped out of the bed, at toes at the door, and closed my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the work of art, which he had bought from me, hangs in his classroom. he is now teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers actually were friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plundered, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded as "air mattress and breakfast" [Airbed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it great, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelettes are completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them all the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecherczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"in this way, we presented the investors:" we want to create a web site, posting public pictures of their private spaces, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed, when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can then invite wild foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">"because we have learned as children, strangers are dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you think about things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the art academy, we learned that design is much more than just look and haptic -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence through design, between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of confidence we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>

<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone from a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"this way, most guests feel when they stay somewhere else."</seg>

<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have imagined his name, if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are hot?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you have 150 assessments, all of which say:" "he can really capture very well unlocked phones!" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">"for a well-through feedback system, confidence is decisive."</seg>
<seg id="173">"at the beginning, we have made some things wrong."</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative judgments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed out their judgements before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust most people who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation harms commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you are told too little, such as" Hi! "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"for example:" "I have problems with my mother" "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, for example" "Tolle Artworks in your apartment! I make holidays with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not expect, was the great deal of people who were more than willing to take these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business runs very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate or rent apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front, when confidence was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, there was only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted each other to be right.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, it can develop wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>

<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay is running."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled across this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing coincide with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about an economic trade.</seg>

<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>

<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and start building up."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I rode -- when we went silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," Be watchful, "Be careful," Be careful, "" Be careful, "" Don't blame you. "</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">Â© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this land have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>

<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly declare itself.</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">"they speak of my church, like a tumour in the body of the USA."</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>

<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, one noticed that it starts online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhorred their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or faith."</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality they can read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was just the opposite. every priest, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"nothing inspires and something that had made sense of her anger, she was a prime target for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam turned the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept her close to the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia and my family are concerned.</seg>

<seg id="360">"a study shows that if you submit a message to test persons in which negative about Muslims was reported, they agree more military attacks on Muslim lands and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic issue.</seg>

<seg id="411">You can also build up-to-charge loadable structures.</seg>

<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the borders of the carrot in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to operate autonomously, it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>

<seg id="420">"External commands are available on the highest level, e.g." "Start" "and" "land". ""</seg>

<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the forwards flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most starters, it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind bushes.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn't matter in what position the optimal position is achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face basic abstract questions leading to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of movable parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled flying devices that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospan, the mechanically simple remote operated flight unit. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no brackets, hinges and transformers, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it's simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to the flying, I have to throw it correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right, if I watch all, is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospan is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the Omnidirectional with its eight propellers, an exercise in excess."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this outflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"in this way, he receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is shot or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight probs."</seg>
<seg id="449">"a lot is possible in models, the rest is learned directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see this.</seg>

<seg id="455">"if you build them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further, if also restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units enables a palette of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We acquired commercial micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully they motivate these demonstrations to reconsider new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Broadway, the particularly secure machine would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway."</seg>

<seg id="492">"this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretic physicist at MIT. he studied gravitational waves of black holes and their observatories like LIGO. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a strengthening of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its contents are stretched in one direction and stout into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative, lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often lead to a real alpine dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and duke, stretch and duke."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched by us during the meeting of the waves. the expansion of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligo, described the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott asserts that LIGO is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite convenient. for instance, you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in killing, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"this is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean you a lot:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties like pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>

<seg id="515">"and Bob is interrupting them." ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "stupid Bob." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same is true for gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot create simple images of objects in the space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by watching changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">"at least, for LIGO, the measured frequencies are in audible range."</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we transform wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravitation, a lot about the collision between two black holes can tell us about the collision between two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time."</seg>

<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, as LIGO watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"in this way, an electrode implanted deeply in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons so that neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered under severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at the time, I was conducting senior doctor and worked day and night in emergency."</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that skull-brain traumata increases the brain and increases skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, you sometimes have to remove a part of a swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-FranÃ§ois Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean with that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not a easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"it is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-FranÃ§ois managed."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the biology course that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small noises of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain drain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the foetus it is responsible for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so secure."</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells, as Jean-FranÃ§ois did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we reimplemented it at the entrance of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we planting these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we planting the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller's help, we could work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely disappeared as if they were removed, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we fed an injury and plagued exactly the same cells and now the cells survived -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were irritated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small dots. these are the cells that we in vitro, dyed in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we couldn't stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">That made them very good.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable fact.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That's not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imiters in Beijing proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy dwindles with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably declared to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my daring friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensible democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are mowed, our future darkened and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion, wishes and suggestions. we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey. online Survey Information for survey participants"</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it" "twin peaks paradox". ""</seg>

<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of untapped cash, which is part of the assets and corporations which are too scared to invest in where it would be productive and to produce income with which one could produce the debt mountain and produce all the things that humanity needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion dollar spent at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-olds employed in the United States, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low demand that they do not invest in."</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally, the circumstances bring about the fact that Oedipus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his exceedingly extravagant art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially fund all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial to the rescue of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"(users Viewing this Forum: 2) 1,941 171"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of athenic democracy based on these conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision-making at the Athenian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they give them the right to political participation with the same degree of voice in questions of the government."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenic democracy has not been kept long.</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that lights up very bright, it is burned too quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy came first, as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- was a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our modern democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place, and the economy gradually underwent politics and unleashed it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because you can now be in the government today, yet not in power, because power is detrimental from politics to the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a flock of predators that sustainably die the animals from which it feeds, decimated, that they are starved at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"in a similar way, it is with the economy that has so far cannified the policy that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" Demos, "the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we must reunite the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" Demos "keeps control, as in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">"the Marxist Left had already had this idea a hundred years ago, and it was not very good."</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching from the deacon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only be restored through a miracle, as in ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automating and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separated areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste has become more prosperous, and social conflicts are deeper, as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we need to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we will be able to democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film" matrix "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "or by something that is similar to the company in" Star Trek, "or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "- Carl Sagan"</seg>

<seg id="962">"in the area of the company: ask a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>

<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a freely swaying exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all mankind."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a mutual fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>

<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is to assemble parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe that Netflix was so successful because they have used data and intelligence, where they are also involved in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, which they otherwise wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts, put together again and make a show like" House of Cards "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Â© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, then they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before it was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball. "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." highly likely "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"you can select the most suitable payment method: credit card, bank transfer, check, PayPal etc."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in hindsight to the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more cloned, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I think this as a very encouraging message, that despite the large amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions to be an expert in what you do and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
