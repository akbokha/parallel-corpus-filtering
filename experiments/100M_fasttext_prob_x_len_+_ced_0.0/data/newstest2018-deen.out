Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view to the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are supposed to meet today . &quot;
&quot; a pit chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
petty @-@ hus@@ band@@ ry farms the former basis of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; this is what everyone knows , who had to be upset , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green me@@ adow instead of an uph@@ ill road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als in Bavaria of the state government , are all but up @-@ to @-@ date - but therefore very insi@@ ghtful . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
&quot; then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the area of the Munich Merk@@ ur , since the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet , which one cannot recognize as such . &quot;
&quot; the large picture postcard was incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ du She@@ ets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these were created according to the Bay@@ erns , in 18@@ 64 and 18@@ 64 . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria for the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied territory and gave a top@@ ographical breakdown of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; finally , when the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , they were the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ based map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Relief Administration . &quot;
the offertory Reg@@ es vide@@ bunt will be sung at the feast of St John the Bap@@ tist .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was 21 years after creation of the map , so in 18@@ 77 , as a district of Munich . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling lies in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling concentrate around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian peasant against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is today , nothing can be seen as fields - at first sight : a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ numbered tiles from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; from which the property tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots there are no farmers anymore , but small farmers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the site of the October Festival , was in fact still a me@@ adow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s district , Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only reads the street name &quot; &quot; Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the height of &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Ward &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , one once locked people with ma@@ dness . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich district &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the establishment of the psychiat@@ rist , who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and , for example , ended the count of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he instruc@@ ted the staff to apply force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who has been working for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , it was first place , later extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ sau company in Haar 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , you@@ ths meet in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the Order bought the building complex in 1920 , and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments . &quot;
&quot; West is the soccer field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in an architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ving Institute , which was destroyed during the Second World War when bombing ra@@ ids were destroyed . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; Main Square , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War was a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies ri@@ pped many holes in the inner city in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the German Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
&quot; with the slider tool , the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;

the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will take effect until August 28 , 2017 , calls af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to get special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , fast @-@ based incidents at the last time in the entire state and here are noted here , &quot; says the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
Vali@@ date@@ err@@ or@@ pages Verb@@ ose@@ Output Clean up Markup with HTML @-@ Ti@@ dy Help on the options is available . congratulations
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Ro@@ d Ch@@ apel , the Kansas City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
&quot; the Council also points out on a recently published report of the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Prosec@@ utor , in which black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of their families , friends and employees about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Ch@@ apel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring the money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report program that ranks the state in terms of the number of violations committed to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to sue a company due to housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws allowing local authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the US . &quot;

&quot; if you do not wish your name to be displayed on our website , you may use a nickname &quot;
&quot; as he is also BL@@ HV @-@ chairman of Fis@@ her@@ man , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t profit@@ ably manage on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , much must be mach@@ ined with the brush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ event@@ h farm and crops it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not carry out bio@@ fuel . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader @-@ promoting . &quot;
&quot; at the costs of 3000 to 4,000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be dra@@ ined for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation , &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the preservation area amounts to 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be for@@ ested by at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted over leader , a quarter bore the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , farmers love 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of past@@ ure con@@ j@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; you &apos;re doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women it &apos;s not going . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; &quot; here the best foods are produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scap@@ ing Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg permits the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art funding of women &apos;s f@@ ences .
the aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in addition , the f@@ enced area may not be tractor @-@ resistant ( slope prop@@ ensity to 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the re@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the preservation area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs lie with more than 112 000 Euros . &quot;
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans also appreciate these as well as any other - therefore , the overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ dos Square in Baghdad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olog@@ ues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a hot fight with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CNN on the proposals of the President to dras@@ tically restri@@ ct the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue himself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ eers would have liked him if he had done it .
&quot; but he attacked its importance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that lights the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is correct , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the rebel@@ li@@ ous words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ ding g@@ arbage &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller has not committed himself in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural clas@@ h : it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by presenting the female embo@@ di@@ ment of freedom in an un@@ worn classic portra@@ yal .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she herself has a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ antes .
the link between the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American ne@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change the right wing for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bap@@ tist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty is not a single drawer , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atism that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
the significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative action of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen from the exhaus@@ tive , el@@ event@@ h , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible jour@@ neys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred which is their only source of power . &quot;
world Cup 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics has to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to continue until we find it , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type at the corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Common@@ wealth silver med@@ alli@@ ons , who compete with their fifth World Championships at the 400 m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best overall score of athletes at the World Cup was seven which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ runner Mu@@ ir carries on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 metres , is another vil@@ lain to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; the team captain says she is &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; on the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team but in some cases also in the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour , but to know that my team mates have voted for me and have chosen me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what my speech as captain is concerned ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there .

the father of our country knew something from bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from the interior policy to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , secure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Larry Hogan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
H@@ og@@ ans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore accused him of this week .
&quot; the staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when there is a type like Hogan .
this is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
he has shown a strong hand at the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
&quot; he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters , and playing his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; this is why the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is considered officially designated and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokes@@ woman Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people , which swing online the whi@@ p . &quot;

&quot; and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;

&quot; I commented poli@@ t@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other latest news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same topic , they will be dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the Staff of the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;

this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable ports had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers struck his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters that Washington made . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , were overwhel@@ med by the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have it to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting this .

&quot; this feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the player resident in South@@ port . &quot;
I did not defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open because it was taken from the program in the year after I won it .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we always appreciated .

&quot; in the area of house connections , the location is more complicated than expected , as the underground has a lot of ver@@ ge , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which repeatedly hin@@ ders construction work , represents a major problem for the building tru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off doors is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; the road is closed , and only the buses are permitted to pass through . &quot;
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately , we were treated by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use stove . &quot;
they even use a pot rarely .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ im@@ ency in the un@@ troubled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is usually referred to a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the bon@@ ded tu@@ ber is taken with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the ground floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work such as clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned to the fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hoch@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red for independence against Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so remote as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo prot@@ ectors , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated roof ridges that were converted by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indones@@ ians have made their trip here , for journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honoured a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an from Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has built a value of 3.8 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua also has wooden resources valued at $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; this wealth , however , is a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a sti@@ cking presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ u@@ vian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ans , and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot;

&quot; we Wer@@ den Everything &quot; is said in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ bane in 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year include , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week passes incidents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the bol@@ ts have strengthened , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the population @-@ rich islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ a@@ wes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and g@@ ado G@@ ado , served with mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are struggling to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explained A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who went to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the indigenous Pap@@ ua - the m@@ um m@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the popular and known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal inf@@ rin@@ gements in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua little changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke down on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took an assault on her tone , and came back with four soldiers , the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , said , and sm@@ ote the group with their guns , said the victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice . &quot;
they wore a cerem@@ onial hunting db@@ ö@@ gen and performed the Wa@@ ita dance in the circle and im@@ itate a bird singing - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began tow@@ ing stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TIME document that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , looked at the threatened danger and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TIME on the ver@@ anda of his colourful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ f was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only carries a name like many Indones@@ ians , TIME in a dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief insp@@ ector of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de told rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokesman of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about kill@@ ings was only filmed on the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this event to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to pass through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to Jak@@ arta on June 5 , and said he did not plan to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;

families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims acc@@ use such claims with gri@@ m un@@ believing .
&quot; I was interviewed for four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus recovered the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting bre@@ wer@@ ies have not stopped .
&quot; on Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot down vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ai neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man into the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) began shooting and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly supplied here , so TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to withdraw the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ h@@ eh@@ er@@ d for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army who claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some people never dive again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty is strengthening the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , each of which can process four or five fields of the sweet potato . &quot;
&quot; they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new flights to Nab@@ ire airport in larger numbers . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on international media coverage remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ den and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission to film was given . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to Pap@@ ua &apos;s immediate neighbors .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ f@@ ite states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Pal@@ au , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , to examine the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the allegations from the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights violations . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom &quot; &quot; according to a source that also took part at the meeting but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; in 2019 , Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the permanent threat of a common military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; blame &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a last symbolic act of the law : the body of a victim was buried exactly opposite the police and military station . &quot;
&quot; they know they might never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus with her head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do else ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of Dubai &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 metre high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
Dub@@ ai civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units dropped the fire at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00 : 00 GMT ) and cooling down the building .
the government said she was working on providing accommodation for the suff@@ er@@ ers .
&quot; the incident may be a question of safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world . &quot;
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building following its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in Britain the police said , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and disgu@@ ise on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , with about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Meeting .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two wins , th@@ in@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so much estimated five @-@ set classics continue to remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David H@@ agger@@ ty was only scar@@ cely missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said H@@ agger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the job .
&quot; not only for the vote was , after many contradictions , the proposal came to fill the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are compar@@ atively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right in the next year , in the next year . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the cost of the organiz@@ er , the requirements for training places etc. are made easier and the players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;

El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is fond of the huge number of pre@@ positions for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has previously under@@ gone that part of the customers has already re@@ treated their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever trium@@ phant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less gle@@ aming figure : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500,000 pre@@ positions for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k is dreaming : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have been withdrawn from 63@@ .000 already . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that they are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation deposit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present , 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are available in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; the report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market . key Regions • Americas , AP@@ AC , EMEA , and AP@@ AC &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 9,@@ 000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be assembled - 500@@ .000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , a day of 1800 reservations are available . &quot;
&quot; in the second half of 2018 , anyone who orders a &quot; model 3 &quot; must be reck@@ oned at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never in practice tested production lines without any major disrup@@ tions with maximum capacity . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to bigger delays , the non @-@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;

EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt moves to reduce emissions due to the delay of the Obama Er@@ a rules
&quot; one day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce emissions of smo@@ g caused air poll@@ ut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administ@@ rations .

it is about a period that expi@@ red on October 1 for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for soil @-@ near o@@ zone .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan , and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to interfere with economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was president of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone to block or del@@ aying regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ dential regulatory roll back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards would simply strengthen the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely ful@@ fill@@ ment of new standards . &quot;

&quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take Fri@@ ghts seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt may eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available &quot; powers &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive review of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; a draft bill , approved last month , should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years . &quot;

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the Jubil@@ ee of the Berg@@ kirche , on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. we invite you to a ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;

&quot; Walter Martini highlights : &quot; &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ g@@ ish jewel . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Wür@@ tt@@ ember@@ g@@ ischer urn book : &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z &quot; sold the mountain with the parish church on Tum@@ lingen , with the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the legend , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church , there was also a wonderful courtyard , which belonged to the church or pat@@ ron@@ ate law , and not vice versa . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ amt of Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which is still to be seen in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement core of the village . &quot;

this was the right to use a past@@ or or to propose a new past@@ or to the Bishop .
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .

&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were carved and the bell ro@@ pes were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aking .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops arrived near the church . &quot;
&quot; they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church mill , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot;
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night , 18@@ 34 , a storm broke down the storm tower and half crashed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken off . &quot;
only the existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em care about the &quot; creative pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as success@@ ors of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn to the Hil@@ arius plant . &quot;

&quot; the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbin@@ es could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only there existed a wind power concentration zone at the time of Vier@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbin@@ es are generally possible , but the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
these zones are intended to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days before , but the district government had not approved Düsseldorf because of a mistake . &quot;

city and retailer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Langen@@ sal@@ īga and people from the region are to discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September . &quot;
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract residents to shopping in the city centre .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic firms will present their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops are to invite the city centre to the &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only to residents of the city and the closer region . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
city administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; in this way , the business association and the city go into another stage of the &quot; Attra@@ ctive downtown &quot; project . &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ gro@@ omed Sunday , talks with all tra@@ inees and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the ren@@ unciation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
visitors and tourists belong to this .
&quot; however , many locals also lost sight of the city centre at shopping . &quot;
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the inner city - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly spread , King had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , shared the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day for the first time , five Thür@@ inger cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;

&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury ran through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with guns to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the Mob@@ s - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle strike - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked out through the wind@@ screen .

&quot; the silence , when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this horrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a post @-@ order . &quot;
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
&quot; since 2005 , civil rights have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - have been syn@@ dic@@ ated by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody was ever indic@@ ted for murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ concei@@ vable that no one person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts with the organization of post @-@ order . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former member of the state of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
&quot; for him , the post @-@ position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe Community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court doctor lays a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding gra@@ ves were suspected of the Lyn@@ ching process . &quot;
but nobody was ever indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the suspects have been on the free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch campaigns throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote on their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ach , according to the FBI of the black colour guard Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a battle - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our had been in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison was a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they approached from prison and approached the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also evident that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and conce@@ aled the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more memorable .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and when you vote , then you will happen . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is illu@@ stra@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is based on a kind of deep racism , of which many believe that he is no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the ugly in all of us , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - entered a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;

&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ cy Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines . &quot;

there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gig@@ gling . &quot;

&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and exactly as the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ionship replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and with emphasis . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed with a wedding dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning praise of &quot; Strange Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spect@@ ator swe@@ eps sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
&quot; when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys , they have experienced severe humidity . &quot;
&quot; up to this point the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the songs sound out , Gre@@ ene invites you to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cking on their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the quiet body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over . &quot;
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ching rope away and wi@@ pe their tears .

we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience gets together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; on a table , a white couple ch@@ ats from Atlanta on the post @-@ position with a black couple , whom they have just got to know . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which feeling the performance left behind .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues , &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; today this is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks &apos;s farm is at his table , he e@@ ats and recalls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ position is inspiring in a certain way , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;

I prefer a positive resume .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; crowd : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week , I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked in the open whole day at the school .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; crowd : it &apos;s a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late professional volunteer . &quot;
how does that come from ?
quantity : I made a Abit@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , we say , successfully abandoned . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it &apos;s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what do you do . &quot;
&quot; for a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe too , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start studying in social life in the winter semester . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably in the youth center Her@@ ne a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the university college . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different uses during the volunte@@ ering service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you are doing its FS@@ J .

the bombing is the last act of violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement of Nato , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was done when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive weapon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agram air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombing in the town centre killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest militant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering raising the number of US troops to support military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bomb@@ ings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;

&quot; however , there is no planning obstacle for this project to be implemented by a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion regarding a shared space . &quot;
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the municipality .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would be a living space - around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council suspended , such a common room , not as a meeting place only for the residents of the living @-@ fair housing , but openly entering into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; kn@@ itted café &quot; &quot; made the turn . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget , has already been decided in the past autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the refur@@ bishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a communal area would be , so T@@ j@@ aden reports , supporting 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal will be to signal the investor in order to indicate that in this respect , there is no b@@ link between the legs - as well as a console roof - which reduces the pitch height and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wilfried Soh@@ mer , is this addition . &quot;
&quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body . &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .

&quot; a &quot; &quot; Star Path &quot; &quot; comes from the information needs of many resin visitors , whose name was called it . &quot;
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;

&quot; on the Star Path , the viewers learn a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;

Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing competition in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , up to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Boxing Council Light@@ weight Champion , down the hall@@ way to gre@@ et Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing Organisation Super @-@ Balance Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7@@ pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size arrangement . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I am risen for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I would like to get down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans are asking for the fans .
let &apos;s give them this .
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxes need this battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that will fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell following their lightweight @-@ weight title fight in the Forum on September 23rd . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all the fans asked him , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later decided to fight with the network , which offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he admi@@ res Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday combat . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko stayed with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the tri@@ athlon champion from River@@ side is very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show stroke strength , then boxing . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the momentum , which was built for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after tyre punc@@ ture
&quot; in an accident on the A7 , four persons were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control over his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 p.m. in front of the connection office . &quot;
&quot; the car sli@@ pped right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then stood on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was locked towards the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 in the season op@@ ener , Andre Hoffmann is hoping for the optim@@ isation of the defense formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , because there wasn &apos;t the two opposing gates at 2 : 2 against Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to do better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge , the three @-@ chain should also be further optimised . &quot;
&quot; and a gate , after a breach , will no longer be caught up . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better in preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; his train@@ ers Fried@@ helm spark@@ le , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we &apos;re just in the triangle at the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ elmann &apos;s players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prer@@ equis@@ ite is , however , that we are still more harmon@@ ious and we don &apos;t play as many play@@ grounds in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk about a mis@@ erable start , you don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after six to eight playing days , I judged the start of the season , &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm spark@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken early because of an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; says the inner defence of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland serve as a slight favorite on Sunday . &quot;
&quot; that we are going to swe@@ ep it , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is stupid , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no squ@@ ad in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; says Fort@@ un@@ as chief coach . &quot;
&quot; to meet such a statement , arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t would be arrogan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and so , Funk@@ el will not be able to experience his players on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for Foren@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ tt@@ s@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun testing the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , the app@@ rais@@ al of the age should be more precise after the Swedish migration authority ( migration runs ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were under age . &quot;
&quot; until today , migration has been sent to test cases 6,@@ 8@@ 80 and the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency now publi@@ shes the results of 2,@@ 481 Tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency reviewed that the person &quot; might be 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent with recent months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person was judged more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the paper Sven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det reviewed the 5@@ 81 results , she noticed that in 243 cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , for X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rine Claude Marcus of Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the evaluation of the biological mat@@ ri@@ ces of people to see whether they went earlier or later than pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used .
the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low . &quot;

&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Public Transport and Traffic in the Federal Council of Canada . &quot;
&quot; in April , the works started at the same time at all three renov@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is scheduled for October and light is sure to keep the timet@@ able .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , she has come to the years now . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabili@@ t@@ ated . &quot;
the two other bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 1.@@ 30 m wide and seven tonnes of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the northern side .
&quot; this is a marginal attachment , which is also used as an operating track . &quot;
at the southern part of the bridge the bridge should be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge .
then the pedestrian route is going to go .
&quot; the special thing is that there are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ z@@ wo . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge sections .
special finger@@ tip sensitivity has necess@@ itated the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;

&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road is closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the costs for the three bridge operations amount to 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;

Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want to be a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife . &quot;
the Royal House was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is set aside in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral church . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
&quot; the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , following the announcement . &quot;
&quot; when Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , it is still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be set aside in his French home country .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a command that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would be king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also under@@ lines the title &quot; &quot; princ@@ ely &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not receive the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief of the Danish royal house . &quot;

&quot; but he did not intend to be set aside in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land he has worked for over the past 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
&quot; at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot;
&quot; while his later wife always flew the sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year @-@ old reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expressed over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ aying , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk so@@ cks instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellectual intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not ash@@ amed .
this was just two mistakes ! &quot;

Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is talking and answer . &quot;
&quot; Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumer and consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ e.org , the federal states set up the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; also , if after all we know presently , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the enlighten@@ ed minister is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ? &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has turned off immediately and is in close contact with the authorities of the countries in close cooperation with the authorities of the countries . &quot;

&quot; on the contrary , they must reck@@ on with economic damage based on pres@@ um@@ ably illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little check@@ ers in the harvest . &quot;
what are the key drivers behind recent market changes ? what is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
&quot; it was just the official controls , which have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and hand@@ over to the authorities in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are available are of crucial importance . &quot;

how to influence the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded spending of European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UE@@ FA , as the leading organisation responsible for the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair play rules , launched in 2011 by the UE@@ FA , mean that PS@@ G has to be able to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make the money loose with security so that N@@ ey@@ mar signed and put it into a gal@@ ax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich sovereign family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may apply for a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must interact with legitimate income sources , which allow them to play the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , after his election to the UE@@ FA president in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that associations , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ked to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ mo@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and even though Plat@@ ini has fallen by the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UE@@ FA successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to fri@@ ghten away from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly enhance the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UE@@ FA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract . &quot;

&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time , 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
the UE@@ FA is looking for clubs that might try to over@@ see their financial supervision by bl@@ aming up their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UE@@ FA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the PS@@ A was raised by Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar on payments to the 2022 World Cup 2022 World Cup 2022 .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar WM &apos;s ambass@@ adors will be able to find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UE@@ FA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UE@@ FA will be more atten@@ tive to consider any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s way@@ ward by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in regards to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state owned by a club . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play , because you can have different paths or have different interests , if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;

&quot; this re@@ petition of history is nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ ehler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and a embo@@ di@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era . &quot;

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over an increase .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; mot@@ ions &quot; &quot; than they retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increased pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank voted with 6 to 2 for keeping interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month , because weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and declined to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household income would continue to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alised that interest increases would be needed in the coming years to re@@ produce the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it , and said that lending costs would have to rise more than expected at the financial markets . &quot;
members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut @-@ economic package that was issued a year ago after Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , even though it was said that it is expected to provide $ 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the rate of interest , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central forec@@ asting of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , they repeated that &quot; a certain ti@@ ghtening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to bol@@ ster inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent than markets . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases were &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to the dollar and the euro after these news .
the pound fell 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have damp@@ ened the rise in interest rates and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and marginal income increases , as the ti@@ ghtening will get worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years could not &quot; &quot; prevent income &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; recover . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak Po@@ und , which will offset some of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pound . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably last four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the last judgment of the bank to interest rates , the call for interest was increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will return in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that exceeding the ratio of 2 % is &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; attri@@ but@@ able to the weak l@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent return of the s@@ wap rates , the mortgage market should be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be disputed HIV drug , 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ exp@@ ending phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk patients by around 86 percent , will now be delivered by health care via a first three @-@ year study for 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the App@@ eals Court confirmed that the Court of App@@ eal confirmed that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p , despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the announcement announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) called this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first that will enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in whole England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ exp@@ position phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pre@@ p reduced the HIV transmission in inf@@ ecting endanger@@ ed significantly .
pre@@ p prior to inter@@ course means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medication may be taken every day or so for two hours before inter@@ course .
&quot; for those involved in the treatment , gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a GP may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs during this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Stev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; This great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pre@@ p , if it is targeted specifically for need@@ y and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to , people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to improving many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV has left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p @-@ test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected . &quot;
&quot; Sharon Ho@@ dg@@ son , Minister of Justice , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the Pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delay . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV infected , and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the big living : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court flat into a spacious home .
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ sted in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne didn &apos;t pack her bags and sold .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day .
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a scre@@ wed layout - had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to optim@@ ally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place for Jo@@ anne &apos;s life . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to resolve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked together , without having to fill ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous residential area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theater , space and light . &quot;
&quot; in both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
at the entrance we offer mirr@@ ored units square for all cut@@ lery and j@@ ars by Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; Er@@ fan explains from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is important , so that when you slide down the door very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which are therefore helping to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square met@@ ering of some standard in something quite astonishing .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate empire Vict@@ ori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute about separation occurs in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a store in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there he founded the West@@ co Jeans family and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler , as well as shopping centres in the subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Colin was described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; a court file states that , in the value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth of 176 million dollars , Colin is owned by the value of € 316 million . &quot;
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of concern for Paul .
&quot; the up@@ pers suggested by Colin made him leave him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed attempts , the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin , like Paul says , have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Colin argues that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul to ad@@ minister some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ it submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both sides held by law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Colin opened the first je@@ an shop of the family . &quot;
&quot; Colin says that he started West@@ on when he was the High School in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment , &quot; she wrote . &quot;

Tr@@ ump &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the president &apos;s media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence .
others tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly is able to do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a reduced course . &quot;
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new chief of staff of the White House , met with senior staff at his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that came into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media thickness . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship to television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Can@@ didate Tr@@ ump was upset because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were convincing , &quot; &quot; said the former campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umps Twitter habit under control , according to six former election officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter habit ever was under control is ridicul@@ ous .
maybe these campaign officers know something we do not know - that Tr@@ umps Twe@@ ets without their interventions would have included more ignition .
we will probably never know about the Twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump does not send .
&quot; if his staff have managed to keep away from him several times , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump &apos;s controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House assembled from competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that might promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the advis@@ ors of the advis@@ ers , to the President of strategic reasons , dou@@ bt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by Rep@@ orters Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump may react as a volcan@@ o to negative press cuts , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks , and to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February when someone was mal@@ ici@@ ously accused of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ oc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for Sch@@ ik@@ anen , or that he has no concrete evidence or that he has sold false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former staff of staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers are still stri@@ ving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make wa@@ iter &apos;s mission very difficult .

&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports after they were thrown out in May , without having been deter@@ red by a gra@@ bbing by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense equipment and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no need to worry about it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must act in action by shooting , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved and are back again . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more . &quot;

I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my church taxes if the Council cannot even stop this .
&quot; a n@@ atives who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of these travelers only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; one speaker of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the land beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to keep it as fast as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents call on anti @-@ social or criminal conduct in the police by calling 101 . &quot;

&quot; in the Russia affair by U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is alleged to have used a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Grand Jury &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special investig@@ ator Tr@@ ump had personally put into the center and seek the accus@@ ation whether the president may ob@@ stru@@ ct the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible crimes and determine whether accus@@ ation shall be raised .

&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the enforcement show that Mu@@ eller is not shy in his work and that he should act quickly , if necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump &apos;s concern . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President took a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme of the demo@@ crats is a way of feeling good , because they have nothing else about which they can talk about . &quot;

&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it &apos;s called in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump were no@@ isy , he wanted to ob@@ stru@@ ct the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to susp@@ end the investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o and his staff . &quot;
this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would dism@@ iss Mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent special promot@@ er of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate scandal surrounding the later rec@@ lassi@@ fied President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;

&quot; with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants who have registered researchers in the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for man does not go out of him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the ice mountain , according to research data is unclear . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there has been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of Eis@@ schel@@ fen in the region for about 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a background background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this may be related to heating warming . &quot;
the now broken Kol@@ oss was part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it grows ever further into the sea and breaks out regularly .
Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
&quot; at the north of this corn@@ co@@ aster , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ ting some years ago was disturbed . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice sheet stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece is broken at a key point . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the level of sea level , since they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice so much water as it yields after melting . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ se leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in small dimensions , writes the British research project to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI specifications , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest carp@@ enter in Ant@@ arc@@ tica . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks up regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and is no direct link to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most soft@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; according to scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will continue to grow or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; in the past few decades , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has been falling apart . &quot;
this long skirt of Ant@@ arc@@ tica stretches towards South America .
&quot; after data from the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline . &quot;
&quot; the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years , and thus count towards the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;

Italy has intensi@@ fied the tone to NGO Mig@@ rants li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ots
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs , campaig@@ ning rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not hold on new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Rescue et &apos; because their team worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself to detailed allegations of the Italian prosec@@ utor &apos;s Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the rescue of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can assess all accus@@ ations currently being raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of &apos; Youth Rescue &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his crew will take hos@@ tili@@ ties on board , which will be delivered directly from human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smug@@ gl@@ ers can drive away so that the ships can be re @-@ used . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s case , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police official who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions , have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Arms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not have any &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel prize @-@ winner organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti also said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy , which resulted in the efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;

Ingo F@@ ac@@ om also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German sports college in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , condem@@ ns Conrad Roy to suicide , &quot;
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in June , Carter was sentenced to death by Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his voc@@ ation .
&quot; she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her lawyers argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter was standing with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she did not show any rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they completely de@@ pl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that her &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even her mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , saying that there is &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I walk with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for etern@@ ity with us for his sisters , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person to have , with whom I &apos;ve been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to challenge another , commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to finish his life . &quot;
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , make yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Everything you need to do is switch to the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few who defended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;

&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350@@ ,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chairman said that &quot; &quot; it &apos;s smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions &quot; &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is resident - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen ox@@ ides , em@@ itting the diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for autom@@ akers , equipment for neutr@@ alizing diesel vehicles exposed to diesel vehicles , also make it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of re@@ covering the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the problem .
&quot; the companies are trying to avoid the faul@@ ts of Volkswagen , which could be used by so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but return to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , following the authorities of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been extended . &quot;
Volkswagen &apos;s involvement in the investigation could be heavily loaded : the luxury car manufacturer carries a disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ately propor@@ tion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .

climate change as an impulse for the economy : paths to a climate @-@ neutral city
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is declining due to the conditions of dro@@ ught , and because of diseases over@@ bearing insects , scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches are prepared . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endanger@@ ed because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change in the spring , which has been much less ra@@ iny in the spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has implications for the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that carries the d@@ warf @-@ goat , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it &apos;s a lot on the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only for tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have small , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts of essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spraying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce are usually meeting on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime and corrupt officials and in@@ escap@@ able drug wars .
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety . &quot;
they told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leaving them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a pla@@ que on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the rep@@ orters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 , there was at least seven dead in seven states . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her In@@ spir@@ ator from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although in 2010 , a Son@@ der @-@ Federal Prosec@@ utor was set up in order to process the cases of journalists , it was only initiated by the Committee to protect journalists from two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ers , each year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the murder@@ ers of journalists are rarely put to trial . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still ins@@ ist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , though they are in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally and even though the terrain is still more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we miss everyone . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the province capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he just managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth flow . &quot; &quot;
the cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a was one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums of drug king@@ doms , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of peace if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; at first there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival anti@@ trust groups in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the children , pres@@ umed gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to not force , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper published in the same story , leaving the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ sts in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journalism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ orters liked to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October . &quot;
you need to take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird that was like a do@@ cking worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office and sitting there at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine destruction ?
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best , and to stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer considered in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive smug@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the Government to protect the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce offices in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ range district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the sh@@ ards , some of the rep@@ orters demanded whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , whom the governor himself was not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
Hemp fashion ( Cann@@ at@@ rade 04 ) Hemp bricks H@@ empf@@ la@@ x European Parliament Strasbourg Hemp tour
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has raised three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known boxing champion Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a expos@@ é to the government spending that concentrated on the home town of the governor .
&quot; and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , leading a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost all the century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers would have seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; in the past we would have known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff have become something they never expected - activists in the name of the press . &quot;
journalist Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the Prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on grounds and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez bl@@ amed the authorities to spy journalists and kill them because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she is once again divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has hurt her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters could not only be killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces , who were infected with organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media watch@@ dog group &quot; artic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were in addition to their seper@@ ated head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue on how El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly established the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists are fle@@ eing from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became reporter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all of their phones began to sum@@ mon . &quot;
a number of shooting galleries with belt riv@@ alling and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan seaside town had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as it was promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the border of the border , they released the news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website on mobile phone . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ s close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in read@@ iness .
&quot; if they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think of it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when the same day that J@@ avier was assass@@ inated , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , if also a fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ orn of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even notice that his fla@@ ky skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had something of a &quot; &quot; quiet past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report published in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the retained fo@@ iled din@@ osau@@ rs , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has surprised researchers , which describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the arm@@ oured plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was gru@@ b on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met on something that seemed out of the surrounding rock at the plat@@ ter , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to expose the wild beast within the 2,500 pound ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blind a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible . &quot;
it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers have found that this plant e@@ ater , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ ute technique that is also used as counter@@ f@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix himself better in his surroundings and to ev@@ ade his enemies , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million year old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Museum@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ ors over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far from which the animals live today . &quot;
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ours the disgu@@ ise of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dator behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous din@@ osau@@ rs car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was rot@@ ting .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his preserved Dar@@ min@@ ate , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and went out into the sea , where he sank to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans are probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintain the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost as much as in the early chal@@ k season .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only play a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although King of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings are published in the current biology journal Current Biology , believe that B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was mum@@ mi@@ fied in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was gru@@ b on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were weigh@@ ed approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops that were covered by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant e@@ ater was sh@@ aken by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the Din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquis@@ itely detail .
&quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the skin @-@ crust still cover hol@@ lowed arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r &quot;
&quot; as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; the remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ lowing arm@@ oured plates , which bear the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .

&quot; it is about light to moderate injuries , said a police spokesman . &quot;
a large collection of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in driving direction Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re return traffic formed . &quot;

&quot; after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock , another accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and d@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .
&quot; in addition , you have to buy it via the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
&quot; and last , one needs a seat reservation . &quot;
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works : one climb@@ s into the train , calls its ticket under &quot; &quot; My tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the test customer , a button for the electronic de@@ preci@@ ation appears . &quot;
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seats Y .
&quot; if the train atten@@ d@@ ant arrives at the ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train , which is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel smoothly without ticket control by our train staff , you simply check yourself in the DB Navig@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , executive vice @-@ president of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;

&quot; who often drives trains , knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket insp@@ ections are among the biggest nu@@ is@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; because often you have yourself , but in any case , one of the fellow travelers does not need all the documents you need to de@@ preci@@ ate online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the identity card or a document you have to have , is missing . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in the control of your own ticket and the conductor will take the time to take care of other matters . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;

how an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; whose streams ?
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and scroll@@ bars by Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; he said there . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; &quot; .. &quot; TH@@ ANK YOU ! ! thank YOU ! ! I have been struggling for weeks trying to get a .@@ swf file into a modal window . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old man who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo . , was killed , live to twe@@ et . &quot;
he wrote a picture of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her mobile phone in order to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police tape and people who scre@@ amed , and from a man who claimed to be his father , who wore a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , escaped another polic@@ eman his rifle and scre@@ amed : &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we &apos;ve got used to and which we can call typical .
&quot; at that moment , I felt shi@@ vering . &quot;
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she took a flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ uson one next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened during the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ uson , is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance derived from the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; when Fer@@ rell , with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ uson , the two had a conversation that they had told countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she reminded of what she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take it , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what is happening today is a cli@@ max of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not just activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience an ec@@ cent@@ ly racism , she is not different than the next black women @-@ child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would show you a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when it arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp site when activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner , who made lunch . &quot;
&quot; they prepared bags , and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organising . &quot;
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came in mind : &quot; &quot; want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot;
&quot; these skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rell closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rell &apos;s life as she falls in love and her wife mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said , laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , following the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identified the movie &quot; &quot; Black@@ Lives@@ Matter &quot; &quot; in social media , identified as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , she insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who had stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence although she was at the for@@ efront , because in a life on these cros@@ sings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense your energy through the screen .
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ uson have long since disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , she ple@@ ases herself to a voice and she feels committed to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ uson three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery &quot;
&quot; the bit gallery moves the people , although they are not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold Sp@@ ecks Thees Uhlmann
&quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the theme is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit Gallery says : &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; That would be real great &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ acities ! &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery will be planned exactly on the plot on which the farmer market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing will offer its products . &quot;
at the start of construction work will be concluded .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and for Bed@@ a space with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been selling almost every week in the farmer market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very happy . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s egg .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , this is also possible . &quot;
&quot; above all , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , it comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On September 3 , 2012 &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
there are plenty of things to do in our city .
&quot; you can see how many shops are here , some for months and years . &quot;
&quot; but as it is not yet a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable to retailers . &quot;
&quot; a pity , special shops are almost no longer there and that which is still left will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmer market hall going to work during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .

George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping centre that stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a proper farming market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place anymore . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the premis@@ e of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after it publicly disclosed diplomatic messages on the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
enter multiple addresses separated by commas and / or different lines .
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gres@@ sman and pioneering dis@@ sident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , as anyone could be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , was sentenced to 20 counts in 2013 for 20 counts , including six off@@ ences against the Esp@@ ion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; in prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ fie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly seated on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with whom she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this paper , the artist produced portraits of foreigners from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ t and chew@@ ing gum , extracted from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use were un@@ equal , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of the President would walk sentence and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Obama is just a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing was released after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition some low and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et ways to resolve the rigid divisions he should actually remedy . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things could happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for their over@@ sized signature among them ( &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their sur@@ name is equipped with a heart ) an end of &quot; &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the involvement of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the highly developed scientific ency@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , like amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome is not responsible for who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in one &apos;s own room , is one of the above @-@ mentioned Comic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le mentioned above . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing as she dives with a free @-@ speaking ef@@ one in hand from the discipline of discipline of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; if they keep your speech cold , then they won &quot; , &quot; it means . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets out of Philadelphia . &quot;
I always get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be gre@@ eted in the middle of the room from the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ les that come together like hor@@ des of protesters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted , as all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings cartoon ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ ids were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea like the movement , which was also stuck behind her eman@@ cip@@ ation . &quot;

a nationwide human @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an Oxford University employee after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest war@@ rants for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , like the acts of the cook County court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several Sti@@ cks . &quot;
a joint warning system issued by the Chicago Police Authority that the body was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; officials received a call , came at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au has been declared dead at the place of the events , and det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two suspects , they said officials . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ b@@ age , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had been in judging and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair investigated by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ b@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokesman of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help US investig@@ ators in any concei@@ vable way .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens were shocked and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help finding suspects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building supervis@@ or of the Grand Plaza building , which had just received an enig@@ matic tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as a very cruel one .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) will be implemented to restore the Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ AD@@ A ) .
R@@ US@@ AD@@ A has the right to plan and test in collaboration with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) in a specific stage of fulfilling the timet@@ able .
&quot; the W@@ AD@@ A schedule has been updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for rein@@ forcing R@@ US@@ AD@@ A and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and W@@ AD@@ A in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged dop@@ ing in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not give anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov answered problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains disputed positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ AD@@ A was ruled out in November 2015 as part of the Dop@@ ing @-@ Sk@@ and@@ als of W@@ AD@@ A from the execution of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main district of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ AD@@ A General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ AD@@ A moves in the right direction &quot; to be re @-@ used . &quot;

&quot; from now on , only eggs are allowed to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested to fi@@ pron@@ il @-@ containing anti @-@ lice materials . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
&quot; Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers didn &apos;t trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ rett , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce marketing Hair Care company Madison Reed . &quot;
she has called for help from the outside .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on guard to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; due to the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , conduct specialist groups and demo@@ graphics , and in some cases whi@@ stle blo@@ wers to handle the C @-@ suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
he said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows what units have most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low @-@ tuned results - so you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you will not be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the Financial Technical Site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ ting , the company helps prevent and recognise bad behaviour , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ ool in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; converting has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently been registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ting companies can send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real @-@ time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; there is also an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervis@@ ory Board . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; if a company is found that is badly treated or un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cott , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , Conver@@ ting has been used for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have an easy way to reach their company headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email to the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days general Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the Company Conver@@ ting uses , problems that have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair plac@@ ements - can be identified quickly and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
and we protect our shareholders against employment law .

but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that they couldn &apos;t prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ting offer your software as a service and strain the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; converting received $ 10 million in financing in February of firms such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; in November , he secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than until now .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only in@@ serts . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more committed to make this business successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employ@@ ee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Conver@@ ting and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run good when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; if the Analytics tools promise third promise , commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement is important to the experts in the workplace culture .
&quot; however , the data are useless if the manager of a company does not take action . &quot;
&quot; indeed , when a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company , who have left too much attention on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not going to follow employees , &quot; Did you really listen to me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Reed , who now carries monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ rett . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ strated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better attachment of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practice and makes a long day for br@@ ins
it starts at 4@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus .
some have moved out their trim parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these non @-@ employed minutes are a lunch break . &quot;
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final audi@@ ts before they return to the water man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30@@ am .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday was Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA at 19 : 15 will start to meet the already packed timet@@ ables of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved to the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 prior to formal preparations for their pre@@ lude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they took plac@@ ards , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come back to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is termin@@ ated , which has been abandoned by the clear sight of its fields from adjacent parking and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been disc@@ arded by foot balls , which will be a protective net behind a pe@@ dest@@ al , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a pointed out that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people will rent a room and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video and exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .

creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 and 1980 .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Bew@@ l River valley in Kent , and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England cap@@ tures the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s his thumb print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell smoke , for at the time they lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself would be involved . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is beaten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest , I have over@@ valued my welcome gru@@ dge &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to see the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust obtained full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; said Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to sub@@ merge into the English history , including &apos; The lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who is leaving the newly built castle to join the farm estate of 13@@ 81 . &quot;

&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought , an insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patent that the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell is portra@@ yed out of the 18th century by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite fer@@ vor , making debts and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men en@@ du@@ red their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old wives - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique cri@@ b experiences &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ man@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a San@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed from nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;

military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ ogan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es on reti@@ rements and promotions in the Offic@@ ers Corps . &quot;
so this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the heads of government , the five Deputy Prime Minister also took part in the consult@@ ations as well as the Minister for Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;

&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ il @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ ogan as wire pulling of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 48@@ 6 people , who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erd@@ ogan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; gift &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erd@@ ogan really handle the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the headline &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest@@ ed in the lifting of the head @-@ tu@@ g ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large @-@ scale conflict in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erd@@ ogan will fire another 73@@ 95 coup , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erd@@ ogan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly regarded as the real masters of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the secular state order .
&quot; according to his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ ogan re@@ pressed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ ogan is driving a targeted Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an officer , who was seeking asylum in Germany after the attempt of persecution abroad , sought asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;

Washington modi@@ fies the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries will be issued . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;

the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t be even crazy in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start taking their ascent seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the nipp@@ le and the type of nails . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can adjust his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes more disturbing as many robots have &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; that would be progressive in a Step@@ ford woman . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone membrane .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ oring . &quot;
&quot; and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of rel@@ ent@@ lessly and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , it also has its m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many wor@@ rying aspects in this as@@ cen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the attacks on rape , when one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy failed with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; says it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to some more Dun@@ blan@@ e and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of the time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or offensive , until they give permission to the free market . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has been pra@@ ising women sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Mag@@ d &apos; Report ) is not the graphic images , the twisted body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gil@@ ead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots consists of creating a physical resem@@ blan@@ ce to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( even with porno@@ star proportions ) .
their builder wants them to feel human feeling that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , at the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate or simply walk away from their companion .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ed slaves . &quot;

umps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ era of the Williams @-@ era , that the political divisions which pol@@ arized the US elect@@ orate have also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving Day , there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
we all are pur@@ pos@@ eful to let our filter bags burst open .
&quot; less noticed , the power of Tr@@ umps , to bring families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been visiting the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me of the fact that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it seems to me in a further context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the det@@ ain@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and dr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ot@@ esque possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens of one day will no longer be exp@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans have norm@@ alized the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the fall - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return expi@@ red ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump walks , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York park &apos;s car@@ ou@@ sels , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ un@@ chy and the animals rotate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and clim@@ atic music convey this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the subject @-@ Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience , since there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one was asked afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ essi@@ vely gr@@ inning , while I was tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;

&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your di@@ gestive system .
&quot; however , a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products may alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the inc@@ urable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United States 300,000 causes stomach cra@@ mp@@ s and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while the affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ine to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;

&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;

bacteria of the@@ Y@@ ers@@ ini@@ agen@@ us el@@ ic@@ it intestinal wall@@ inflamm@@ ation@@ and serious diarr@@ ho@@ eal disease as well as other afflic@@ tions in humans . this gen@@ us includes the@@ pl@@ ague path@@ ogen .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacteria type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ il@@ lus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ate , less inflammatory bow@@ el mili@@ eus , if the same system is also involved in people . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was divided apart , was not . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they obtained L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
bacteria of the@@ Y@@ ers@@ ini@@ agen@@ us el@@ ic@@ it intestinal wall@@ inflamm@@ ation@@ and serious diarr@@ ho@@ eal disease as well as other afflic@@ tions in humans . this gen@@ us includes the@@ pl@@ ague path@@ ogen .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , which is known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells like mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ cts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote because these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population .

&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the recent renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote inner development , and not only open new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the government of Karlsruhe that it will be a rehabilitation area III . &quot;
&quot; the amount of funds amounts to 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500 000 euros come from the country , the rest of the municipality . &quot;

&quot; the core of the program are revit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working relationships and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be objective , i.e. per plot . &quot;

&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that produces American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military used to the TIME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and leading officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter , made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited beside a yacht in Ma@@ ine , a fire fighter car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the Chron@@ icle of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy navy commander for aviation . &quot;
the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7@@ am at 7@@ am on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 : 00 and so long until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to restri@@ ction of hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event during the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time . &quot;
&quot; from the records made available , it wasn &apos;t clear whether a second flight crew was required . &quot;
the Hat@@ ch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could harm the purpose .
&quot; a question we set was whether it was a violation of the hat@@ ch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hat@@ ch Act .
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform of the reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
the use of aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically adv@@ anta@@ geous purposes .

the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokesman of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 doesn &apos;t stop bud@@ get@@ ing for the presi@@ dents , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to hour@@ ly rates of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund set for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
&quot; all in all , all in all , there is no doubt that this is the case . &quot;
the White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .

&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs involved in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press secretary of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the application of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are produced in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it .
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter . &quot;

the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the urban nur@@ series , the watch is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban nur@@ sery facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the department of youth aid , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooked is still bo@@ iled out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and ch@@ illed fresh whis@@ k .
&quot; the city operates 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , there are not only children who are looked after 45 hours of lessons in the K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care , when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; 46 partial @-@ time forces from 1st September kitchen service : they warm the food supplies , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal individually , give food out , clean off , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as sevent@@ y groups - decide over the hour@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen assist@@ ants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more integrated , and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is also possible : healthy eating and cooking lessons . &quot;
children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ power to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important to children .

elections can only be representative and credible if women take part in any part of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .

&quot; G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win over the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ ywood , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentrate strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosperity , and in the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urg@@ ently a flour@@ ishing means of production at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch leader at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to the company &apos;s ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;

&quot; we discussed with the employees that we work like all the companies working in a highly competitive and in@@ secure business climate , continuously review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;

&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full and completely . if our operations are changed at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona alert three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga loves her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti regre@@ tt@@ ed
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar after having handed over £ 189 million to release his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record accident ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out outside , although there is a source near the Catal@@ ans Executive Board that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but the football world was warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this view ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di &apos;s signature , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact them , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , they will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
the final report on the abuse scandal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues to be discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman of the reform movement , &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , he was expecting from former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the cathedral choir master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedict XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would be very useful to the Catholic Church &apos;s pres@@ tige if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ issions , or their false assessment of the processes at that time . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in terms of the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ously , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ pi@@ a , Hist@@ orian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep this for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ pi@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the interview with Bayer@@ ischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis took part in the interview with Bayer@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and this is a day @-@ to @-@ day fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; beats have been a normal educational tool , &quot; to deal with nau@@ gh@@ ty children as I was one of them . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed . &quot;

&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sex@@ ually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s , with high plau@@ sibility . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , it can be said that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; at high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims of R. estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;

&quot; Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , gives a contradic@@ tory image of the master &apos;s master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students raise their &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ection@@ ist who became more tangible when a dom@@ sp@@ atz had no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
it &apos;s just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ operation in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
the violence ex@@ ams at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of its sphere of activity .
&quot; you can excuse him at best , to get out of it too late or have the first hints not taken seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which it worked , was perceived by virtually all the sur@@ vey@@ ors - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also wrote a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; &quot; warm @-@ heart@@ ed &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who supplied the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons , and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about its perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emotion , which also led to honey@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; he was deeply regre@@ tt@@ ed , deeply regre@@ tt@@ ed and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be said that such educational methods in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s were widespread , with parents and teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also have experienced this in a secular school , a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art school . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and violence ex@@ cre@@ ting at the primary school , this is certainly Bag@@ at@@ ellen . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; on the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who never understood him are still eag@@ erly a@@ waited . &quot;
&quot; the truth , however , is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way ! &quot;
&quot; in the media , the report was reported very much on the issue of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report any involvement or co @-@ vis@@ or with regard to sexual abuse ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , no . &quot;
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entru@@ sted to the master &apos;s master .
not even the parents were inaugur@@ ated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of the officers representative for the others , &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in education of sexual abuse was , and is , however , that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they did not even trust their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a conductor who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in view of abuse cases ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he could have had timely insights and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I consider it ... even for really absurd , to assume that all of it is just to him ... Bub@@ bles intru@@ sive or more or more opened than to their parents , boarding houses , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; in this way , the report on the very clear result : &quot; that the student and / or their surroundings were entru@@ sted to him in advance , could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any co @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to an advertisement . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to link its good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately , in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; violence ex@@ pe@@ ditions &quot; was read in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former cathedral choir master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; watching &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
do you have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem , that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; but precisely this , in turn , is a mis@@ use of the report . &quot;
&quot; it is clean separately : between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence and , we once again say , other allegations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report presents cases from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the Chief Musi@@ cian of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible testing ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were rig@@ ged and mal@@ adjusted , were all on the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where real sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be prev@@ ailed . &quot;
&quot; but with whom the master &apos;s master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he first got her face when she was already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on that , as most of the witnesses stress , the subject of &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; it was only happy to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heav@@ enly &quot; conditions . &quot;
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was discipline , but not sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to be taken away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods where it was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself , and of the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
what is your alternate email address ? what is your favorite thing ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ ade gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this point , he points out that in the pre @-@ school the test will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press coverage , he recommended penetration . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time , as a legal clarity , as a test pun@@ ish@@ ments had long been banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal gray area , like each one of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was hard to estimate , where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the per@@ missible limit was exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
that &apos;s just right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the testing of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; meaning the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess is right .
&quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken in the primary school of ad@@ vers@@ aries and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls . &quot;
that &apos;s all terri@@ bly aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked out .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipline and punishment , i.e. ear@@ nuts and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;

&quot; what picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time has George R@@ atz@@ inger in talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
is the subject of the test penalty also in the language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so pop@@ e Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , there played only one part of the domain . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I didn &apos;t deny that he had a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism without claiming un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you do not even make a great singer and in front of every success , regardless of what territory , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced since George R@@ atz@@ inger in conversations with her book ?
&quot; I &apos;m not sure where you &apos;re getting your info , but great topic . I &apos;ll definitely dig@@ g it and in my opinion suggest to my friends . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ denti@@ als , regularly contact him to read him - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , v@@ aci@@ al teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect for respect , to which they still look up today and they glori@@ fy them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that you repro@@ ached to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly unfair , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al scap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the stand @-@ up , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , no one would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
