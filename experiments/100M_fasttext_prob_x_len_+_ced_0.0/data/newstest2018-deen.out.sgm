<seg id="3">"a pit chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Petty-husbandry farms the former basis of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"this is what everyone knows, who had to be upset, because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of an uphill road."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals in Bavaria of the state government, are all but up-to-date - but therefore very insightful."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the area of the Munich Merkur, since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flickering carpet, which one cannot recognize as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large picture postcard was incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called" "Urdu Sheets". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"these were created according to the Bayerns, in 1864 and 1864."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria for the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied territory and gave a topographical breakdown of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"finally, when the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, they were the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-based map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "Topographic Bureau" "- and thus the Bayerische Relief Administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The offertory Reges videbunt will be sung at the feast of St John the Baptist.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was 21 years after creation of the map, so in 1877, as a district of Munich."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasant against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is today, nothing can be seen as fields - at first sight: a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered tiles from the so-called" "urine" "from which the property tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots there are no farmers anymore, but small farmers of the plant" land in the sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 the site of the October Festival, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's district, Au-Haidhausen not only reads the street name" "Gasteig" "or from the height of" "Auf der Lüften" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Ward". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, one once locked people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich district" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment of the psychiatrist, who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and, for example, ended the count of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he instructed the staff to apply force against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Haidhausen museum, who has been working for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, it was first place, later extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisau company in Haar 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, youths meet in Munich's Salesianum."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order bought the building complex in 1920, and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the soccer field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was erected in an architectural reference to the original building of the Irving Institute, which was destroyed during the Second World War when bombing raids were destroyed."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" Main Square, "the Kaufingerstrasse was named" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War was a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies ripped many holes in the inner city in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the German Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider tool, the old Munich-map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>

<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will take effect until August 28, 2017, calls afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to get special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, fast-based incidents at the last time in the entire state and here are noted here," says the group's opinion.

<seg id="55">"the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out on a recently published report of the Office of the Missouri General Prosecutor, in which black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring the money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri posted 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program that ranks the state in terms of the number of violations committed to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company due to housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws allowing local authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the US."</seg>

<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, much must be machined with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "we have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," "emphasised Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the eleventh farm and crops it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not carry out biofuel."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader-promoting. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the costs of 3000 to 4,000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the areas could be drained for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation," stressed the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the preservation area amounts to 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be forested by at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted over leader, a quarter bore the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, farmers love 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of pasture conjures."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac said:" "you're doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it's not going."</seg>

<seg id="95">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>

<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans also appreciate these as well as any other - therefore, the overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a hot fight with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President to drastically restrict the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue himself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imiteers would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he attacked its importance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is correct, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the rebellious words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:"</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elding garbage" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller has not committed himself in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural clash: it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an unworn classic portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself has a very different name: mother of Exilantes.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American neativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change the right wing for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is not a single drawer, but rather an early neoconservatism that brings the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative action of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from the exhaustive, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred which is their only source of power."</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who are competing against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is quite modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medallions, who compete with their fifth World Championships at the 400 m hurdle, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best overall score of athletes at the World Cup was seven which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-runner Muir carries on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>

<seg id="150">"the team captain says she is" "enormously proud" "on the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team but in some cases also in the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour, but to know that my team mates have voted for me and have chosen me, makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as captain is concerned?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>

<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the monetary Committee (MPC) of the bank voted with 6 to 2 for keeping interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month, because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and declined to 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household income would continue to rise to almost 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but it signalised that interest increases would be needed in the coming years to reproduce the inflation of the Brexit, and said that lending costs would have to rise more than expected at the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">Members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammut-economic package that was issued a year ago after Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February, even though it was said that it is expected to provide $15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after deciding on the rate of interest, the Bank said:" "in the central forecasting of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak, as pressure on the real income of households continues to be burdened."</seg>

<seg id="1278">The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rise in interest rates and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months has risen to 0.3% in the previous three months.</seg>

<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably last four years until this will reach the prices and the economy.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a preexpending phylaxis (Prep), which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk patients by around 86 percent, will now be delivered by health care via a first three-year study for 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the process after the Appeals Court confirmed that the Court of Appeal confirmed that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep, despite the assertion that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the announcement announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention", "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first that will enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in whole England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexpposition phylaxis (Prep) is a result of HIV drugs that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that Prep reduced the HIV transmission in infecting endangered significantly.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medication may be taken every day or so for two hours before intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"for those involved in the treatment, gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, suitable participants will be identified, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a GP may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs during this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said," "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in coping with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"Prep, if it is targeted specifically for needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September to, people with high HIV risk have access to this NHS-funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to improving many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust said:" "the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV has left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now, as the prep-test medicine was obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Justice, said:" "the start of the Prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delay."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study will be carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV infected, and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">The big living: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resisted in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack her bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a screwed layout - had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place for Joanne's life."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Fan had to think creatively in order to resolve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together, without having to fill ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height, with a lot of additional drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous residential area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theater, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"in both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units square for all cutlery and jars by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went in," Erfan explains from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important, so that when you slide down the door very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which are therefore helping to create an emotional bond in a home," Erfan says. "</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate empire Victorias worth more than 500 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton-Football-Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about separation occurs in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a store in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">There he founded the Westco Jeans family and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the suburb."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her deceased father, Colin was described as" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">"a court file states that, in the value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth of 176 million dollars, Colin is owned by the value of €316 million."</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of concern for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the uppers suggested by Colin made him leave him with what I held for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in an Affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed attempts, the Supreme Court of Justice took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, like Paul says, have excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to administer some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held by law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950-s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="1374">"they used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first jean shop of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1375">"Colin says that he started Weston when he was the High School in my last years, when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass her property to her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment," she wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, where Colin claimed that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Lukas and Mark were," "says Paul," "over the conditions of their financial separation became bitter."</seg>
<seg id="1380">"Colin was very restrained, although he was a former AFL member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of television stars."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin answered by SMS, to say" I can't say much "because the case is in front of the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother."</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly is able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a reduced course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new chief of staff of the White House, met with senior staff at his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that came into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media thickness."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship to television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were convincing," "said the former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever was under control is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officers know something we do not know - that Trumps Tweets without their interventions would have included more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know about the Tweets that Trump does not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff have managed to keep away from him several times, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House assembled from competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that might promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the advisors of the advisers, to the President of strategic reasons, doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporters Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump may react as a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with humiliating leaks, and to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February when someone was maliciously accused of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh to be the source behind a pile of leaks in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for Schikanen, or that he has no concrete evidence or that he has sold false accusations in the past and revoked it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former staff of staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change in the spring, which has been much less rainy in the spring and much more in autumn.

<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce are usually meeting on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime and corrupt officials and inescapable drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades, or leaving them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, there was at least seven dead in seven states."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her Inspirator from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although in 2010, a Sonder-Federal Prosecutor was set up in order to process the cases of journalists, it was only initiated by the Committee to protect journalists from two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of killers, each year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put to trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, though they are intrinsically and even though the terrain is still more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety is little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we miss everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he just managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" twelfth flow. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa was one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums of drug kingdoms, which are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of peace if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"at first there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust groups in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the children, presumed gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez to not force, after the seizure of another newspaper published in the same story, leaving the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Norosts in 2003, when he joined five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters liked to publish hard-fitting examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trade in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You need to take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird that was like a docking worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office and sitting there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best, and to stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home starting and runways" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer considered in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>

<seg id="1877">They also had a exposé to the government spending that concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, leading a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost all the century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military assault."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source about abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because the staff have become something they never expected - activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Journalist Miriam Ramirez snatched a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his."</seg>

<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez blamed the authorities to spy journalists and kill them because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that she is once again divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has hurt her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a valid society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters could not only be killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces, who were infected with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, the media watchdog group" articulo 19 "has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials."</seg>

<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn funk, when he was grub on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met on something that seemed out of the surrounding rock at the platter, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to expose the wild beast within the 2,500 pound (1.100 kg) heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blind a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible."</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - Mona Lisa the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant eater, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a parachute technique that is also used as counterfading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix himself better in his surroundings and to evade his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armors over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta is far from which the animals live today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favours the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous dinosaurs carnivorous predators have to have been," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was rotting.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his preserved Darminate, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and went out into the sea, where he sank to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintain the original form of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost as much as in the early chalk season.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only play a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he is at sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings are published in the current biology journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mummified in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn funk, when he was grub on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were weighed approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tops that were covered by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured plant eater was shaken by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the Dinosaur kept his armour in exquisitely detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the skin-crust still cover hollowed armoured plates along the dinosaur"</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"the remains of the skin still cover the hollowing armoured plates, which bear the skull of the animal."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "whose streams?</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"only one day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment that they rented and scrollbars by Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," "he said there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">America's strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans-Atlantic security partnership</seg>
<seg id="2025">"".. "THANK YOU!! thank YOU!! I have been struggling for weeks trying to get a .swf file into a modal window."</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year old man who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., was killed, live to tweet."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He wrote a picture of Browns lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," "thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her mobile phone in order to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police tape and people who screamed, and from a man who claimed to be his father, who wore a sign with the inscription:" Fergusons police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, escaped another policeman his rifle and screamed:" I'll kill you... animals all. ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we've got used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"at that moment, I felt shivering."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She took a flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson one next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened during the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance derived from the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrell, with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had told countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she reminded of what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not just activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience an eccently racism, she is not different than the next black women-child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would show you a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when it arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp site when activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">"they prepared bags, and helped to pass them on demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in organising."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came in mind:" "want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," "said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and her wife marries."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of the black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identified the movie" "BlackLivesMatter" "in social media, identified as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main load of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, she insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who had stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence although she was at the forefront, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense your energy through the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racist connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"she describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home:" a chaos. ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">"however, she pleases herself to a voice and she feels committed to this memory since she went to Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>

<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves the people, although they are not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold Specks Thees Uhlmann</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook page" Volksfreund Bitburg, "the theme is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit Gallery says:" "that would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" "That would be real great" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "no man" "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megacities! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery will be planned exactly on the plot on which the farmer market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing will offer its products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the start of construction work will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and for Beda space with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been selling almost every week in the farmer market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher's egg.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, this is also possible."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"above all, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery, it comes to the amount of rent."</seg>

<seg id="2107">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are plenty of things to do in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">"you can see how many shops are here, some for months and years."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but as it is not yet a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable to retailers."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"a pity, special shops are almost no longer there and that which is still left will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery doesn't fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the farmer market hall going to work during the construction time?</seg>

<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to promote a proper farming market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg have no place anymore."</seg>

<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the premise of Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to a 35-year prison sentence after it publicly disclosed diplomatic messages on the website of WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">Enter multiple addresses separated by commas and / or different lines.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgressman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, as anyone could be interpreted with these genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, was sentenced to 20 counts in 2013 for 20 counts, including six offences against the Espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly seated on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with whom she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this paper, the artist produced portraits of foreigners from forensic artefacts like cigarette butt and chewing gum, extracted from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg on a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her imprisoned Muse were unequal, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" "Suppressed Images", "which foresaw a future in which the President of the President would walk sentence and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in fact, Obama is just a few days after the book was released, Manning was released after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition some low and strong, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweet ways to resolve the rigid divisions he should actually remedy."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things could happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for their oversized signature among them (" "i" "in their surname is equipped with a heart) an end of" "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the involvement of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), like amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome is not responsible for who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in one's own room, is one of the above-mentioned Comic-Novelle mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she dives with a free-speaking efone in hand from the discipline of discipline of the United States such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they keep your speech cold, then they won", "it means."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets out of Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I always get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room from the masks, from her own genomic simulacles that come together like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted, as all in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Mannings cartoon), in which their genetic haploids were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea like the movement, which was also stuck behind her emancipation."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't be even crazy in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start taking their ascent seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of nails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can adjust his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the form of nipples to type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes more disturbing as many robots have" "personalities" "that would be progressive in a Stepford woman."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone membrane.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shoring."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of relentlessly and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible," warms the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, it also has its moods - quite like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many worrying aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the attacks on rape, when one step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, troubled one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True Companion Roxxxy failed with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" "says it on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing sophistication point to some more Dunblane and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore."</seg>

<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange or offensive, until they give permission to the free market."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"however, there is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has been praising women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Magd 'Report) is not the graphic images, the twisted body and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots consists of creating a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builder wants them to feel human feeling that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, at the point when it comes to their" personalities, "robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply walk away from their companion.</seg>

<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacteria type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich diet tolerate, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system is also involved in people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was divided apart, was not."</seg>

<seg id="2594">"the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so that a gut microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they obtained L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>

<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism, which is known as indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells like mice and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote because these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">"this means that the resource in question identified itself as" "XHTML 1.0 Strict" "and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it."</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to be discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement," We are Church, "declared after publication in relation to the German press agency, he was expecting from former Regensburger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the cathedral choir master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would be very useful to the Catholic Church's prestige if Müller and Ratzinger would have expressed their deep regret about their own omissions, or their false assessment of the processes at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"on the other hand, the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticized that in reporting on violence in the Domspatzen," "two measures". ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in terms of the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it was" shameful and shameful deeds "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but conspicuously, the author Lucetta Scarpia, Historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep this for normal," writes Scarpiia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis took part in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" we are happy to go to the church and this is a day-to-day fresco. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" beats have been a normal educational tool, "to deal with naughty children as I was one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope brother George Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the" "Mein Bruder of the Pope" "(translated into 12 languages) with Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s, with high plausibility."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994:" "in summary, it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"at high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to numerous other accusations, many victims of R. estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" Incidents of Violence "at the Regensburger Domspatzen, gives a contradictory image of the master's master Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students raise their" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who became more tangible when a domspatz had no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"you can select the most suitable payment method: credit card, bank transfer, check, PayPal etc."</seg>
<seg id="2914">It's just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of complicity or co-operation in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence exams at the pre-school also took place outside of its sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can excuse him at best, to get out of it too late or have the first hints not taken seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was perceived by virtually all the surveyors - literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also wrote a very excellent testimony, describes him as" "warm-hearted", "" "sincere", "" "competent", "" "competent" "and" "understanding" "as extremely good-natured teacher who supplied the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons, and" always surrounded by the grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotion, which also led to honeycomings."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he was deeply regretted, deeply regretted and apologized for this."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, it must be said that such educational methods in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s were widespread, with parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also have experienced this in a secular school, a state-of-the-art school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"in comparison with what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and violence excreting at the primary school, this is certainly Bagatellen."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"Marcia Cross in" "Quantico" "(Spoiler)"</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian pope, many who never understood him are still eagerly awaited."</seg>
<seg id="2928">"the truth, however, is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!"</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report was reported very much on the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report any involvement or co-visor with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">"Michael Hesemann: no, no."</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the master's master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said one of the officers representative for the others," "It was very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in education of sexual abuse was, and is, however, that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even trust their parents and siblings, then certainly not a conductor who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in view of abuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he could have had timely insights and could have been able to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... even for really absurd, to assume that all of it is just to him... Bubbles intrusive or more or more opened than to their parents, boarding houses, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report on the very clear result:" that the student and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance, could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any co-operation."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to an advertisement."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to link its good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately, in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" violence expeditions "was read in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former cathedral choir master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "watching" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do you have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"but precisely this, in turn, is a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is clean separately: between the pre-school and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, we once again say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report presents cases from the time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the Chief Musician of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible testing pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were rigged and maladjusted, were all on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where real scandalous conditions have to be prevailed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom the master's master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he first got her face when she was already on the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that, as most of the witnesses stress, the subject of" "Vorschule" "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"it was only happy to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" heavenly "conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but not sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at the most, the accusation remains to be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods where it was reported from the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself, and of the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">What is your alternate email address? what is your favorite thing?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspade gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this point, he points out that in the pre-school the test will continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press coverage, he recommended penetration."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time, as a legal clarity, as a test punishments had long been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal gray area, like each one of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was hard to estimate, where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the testing of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "Fallstrick of Anachronism", "meaning the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was broken in the primary school of adversaries and violence against innocent children's souls."</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all terribly awful and I'm glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of discipline and punishment, i.e. earnuts and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">Hemp fashion (Cannatrade 04) Hemp bricks Hempflax European Parliament Strasbourg Hemp tour</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger time has George Ratzinger in talks with you for the book" "My Brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Is the subject of the test penalty also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, there played only one part of the domain."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I didn't deny that he had a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once: without this perfectionism without claiming unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, you do not even make a great singer and in front of every success, regardless of what territory, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced since George Ratzinger in conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"I'm not sure where you're getting your info, but great topic. I'll definitely digg it and in my opinion suggest to my friends."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with, like many former Domspatzen, 23 years after his emeridentials, regularly contact him to read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, vacial teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect for respect, to which they still look up today and they glorify them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that you reproached to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unfair, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stand-up, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
