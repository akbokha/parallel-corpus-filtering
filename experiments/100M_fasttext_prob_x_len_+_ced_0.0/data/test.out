&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; and with that , the riding career ended again . &quot;

&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award is very promising to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been sponsor@@ ing the offspring for several decades .
&quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time U.S. Masters champion was shot on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claiming Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will continue to reg@@ ain regulatory regulations , and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; the state has certain tasks to open up certain tasks , to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and need money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , they say . &quot;

oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas to cancel the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand the renewable energy with its investment programme and urges : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far apart .

&quot; at the same time , both the United States do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but rather simply to protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should then be paid better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
he wants to raise it up to 15 dollars a hour .
&quot; it is not clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ att@@ led , then he says that he may not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump who wants to re@@ lie@@ ve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold him , so that the budget deficit would be even bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least want to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;

it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope for Europe . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for women , there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away from it because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced labour , hon@@ our@@ able murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , this continues . &quot;
&quot; the fact that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; here too , women in refugee camps are often regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case . &quot;

some of the children are certainly not volunte@@ ered .
many women are so used to say nothing .
or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big .
&quot; as they often do not know how to help , there are more accommodations just for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their area of competence , some say no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ conia , there is something in housing of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , w@@ inged women are not accommod@@ ated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government . &quot;

&quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are being held separately . &quot;

&quot; as much as the women feel this need of protection , one can read at the rush , which there is on the house in Munich . &quot;

representatives of the As@@ sist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new labour action measures in their disputes about a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested the whole council to appro@@ ve more labor action from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have agreed to address the concerns about the treaty .
&quot; in July , assistant doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was refused by 58 percent of its members who voted in elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members released on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; per@@ sist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the agreement was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Executive Committee has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and requ@@ esting official re@@ election to all your troubles . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today announced a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labor action that begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assist@@ ants in this year were six times , the first total failure in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the Head of the BM@@ A Assistance Doc@@ tors Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana came back to the conclusion of the refusal of the agreed contrac@@ tual terms that were recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were still held before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
France doesn &apos;t recognize legitimacy of the Russian elections in Crimea
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin adop@@ ts his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Put@@ ins &apos;s smile seemed narrow and he barely had heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ ogan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; on the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ ogan had beha@@ ved as if it had never happened . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shooting of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
&quot; Mosk@@ al - Nov 1st 2016 , 6 : 49@@ pm &quot;
Putin denoun@@ ced and accused Ankara that Russia had fallen into his back .
&quot; it was even greater , since it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
&quot; to re@@ build the ve@@ to , it will be difficult if not impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , state @-@ controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; on the serious , accus@@ ations from leading officials , that Erd@@ ogan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ence .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology he wanted to hear from President Erd@@ ogan . &quot;
Russia was able to reserve a sort of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; in the first line , Erd@@ ogan needs all the friends he can get after the last month in a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
retri@@ eved 16 March 2010 . ( archi@@ ved at Web@@ C@@ ite )
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are res@@ umed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West because its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power was regarded as a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the ongoing debate about the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ v@@ ot is to draw benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian State of State won a bonus for the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat in Ankara following the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which is even a deep @-@ seated fear of reg@@ im@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y the &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries , who hide from the West and feel badly treated and now allied themselves . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently been part of the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presi@@ dents were saying that they did not even seize the subject .
&quot; the President of Turkey inten@@ tionally avoided a question of its differences , while Putin decided to emphasize that . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and given the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are at least talking together . &quot;

Poroshenko to speak at UN General Assembly meeting dedicated to large movements of refugees
Russian President Vladimir Putin released his staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov un@@ expect@@ edly .
Ivan@@ ov was a part of Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ denti@@ ality .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been the deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplomat . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was a protocol chief and chief executive of the government . &quot;
&quot; on his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of head regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV broad@@ caster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended as his successor .
convincing the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ denti@@ als , working as he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff re@@ signs on their own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the ridicul@@ ousness of the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
no one knows no one at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who once had been praised as a potential president who would like to conduct the Russian environmental policy - met great skep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you to talk to me at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compla@@ ined posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been president of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most . &quot;

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
&quot; by May 2017 , the £ 1,@@ 35 billion will be completed by May 2017 &quot;
engineers have joined the North deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings via the vi@@ adu@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; deck@@ chairs &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weigh@@ s 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lan@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; by May 2017 , the £ 1.@@ 35 billion will be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
business Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closing between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a hot activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fitting . &quot;
&quot; all in all , almost 79 % of the total bridge @-@ ende@@ cks are at their place and the final section of the deck is now received in Ros@@ y@@ th &apos;s deck , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high and deep engineering .
&quot; after installation of the last street closure and its connection with the Nord@@ tower deck , we had to close the gap to the north or the country side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern supply bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hot activity .
&quot; massive , because the vi@@ adu@@ kt is 222 meters long , weigh@@ s about 6@@ 0,000 tons and has to be drawn up by an inc@@ line of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , they were tiny - on each side they only used a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
three men are lucky to be alive after they were cast off from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re RN@@ LI rescue station struck 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved out of their own force . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat apart from their reach until we left to water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a Bo@@ je without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived on board of the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have been un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop@@ per , but this dis@@ b@@ anded the boat from the person who sailed the boat . &quot;

how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; for the next council meeting , the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; for the next council meeting . &quot;
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
&quot; first of all , it is about the question : who should build the favorable housing ? &quot;
&quot; so far , a regulation is missing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas must exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot;
&quot; however , the favorable apartments can also arise in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the big point of dispute in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; Brat@@ man : &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are built as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing construction programme , which will cost millions of dollars and will still be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ man : &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;

&quot; if the action concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the program is not complete : for the around 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how does one compare the loss of other around 1300 favorable apartments , whose promotion will run out over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be purchased off @-@ off bind@@ ings from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought that apartments will be returned to the price . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; at a blow , the problem is solved . &quot;
&quot; in the western city , the end of the year is dead@@ lier . &quot;
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price connection for cheap apartments . &quot;
&quot; only : they want the owners , the housing companies do not want . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased , from the goal of so @-@ called interference . &quot;
a concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few parts of the city is not supposed to give anymore .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU has to go into the boat for a broad majority . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children do no longer go outside , but rather prefer spending their free time to star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ent over the last decade . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
&quot; I prefer the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; as many phenomena of pop culture declined the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .

how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go out with their smartphones outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , which are followed by a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch that pursu@@ es 35@@ .000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after launch of the game , the number of tra@@ ce@@ able people who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health , people want to take 30 minutes to get &quot; &quot; coming out of the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; being active every day &quot; &quot; came on de@@ af ears , because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look el@@ end . &quot;
&quot; however , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that makes them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic players who have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it about ?
there has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit have been able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game . &quot;
&quot; the new will lose its appeal , and the use will continue with time . &quot;
&quot; because of Pok@@ em@@ ons success , however , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the active players in the real world and will help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast climbed to the multi @-@ competition title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .

she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment was an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; it has dominated the last three years , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lou Save of her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I ever saw . &quot;

episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
&quot; according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed , who were killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks for a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Ro@@ ch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in an entrance , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the offen@@ ders fired eight shots out of a fire@@ arm , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ bery , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that shooting the investig@@ ators had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at it , whether they were associated with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed and two more injured in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown guy from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they had led to the conclusion that attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parking car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about shooting , which resulted in an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ icles and secured a ball from the seat , as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment . &quot;
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; better &quot;
&quot; like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his ageing , Edmund Optics has nothing to do with the result of a genetic disorder affecting his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was that I couldn &apos;t do that . &quot;
I do not create that .
I didn &apos;t let it down .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , you have left it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; Vincent and her husband have been told that Edmund will never be able to recognize them , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first response was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Edmund can walk with the help of a help .
Edmund could neither sit nor kra@@ b@@ ble until his third year of age and he cannot speak yet .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the character language , which &quot; &quot; Please sing something &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but there is no typical sign language -- she says . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
&quot; micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic , as in case of Edmund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is reminis@@ cent of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she doesn &apos;t know it yet .
&quot; for a long time , I didn &apos;t ask for the pro@@ g@@ nosis since a long time , because I am not expecting that someone can really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful rate for m@@ amm@@ als caused by birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .

&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesperson for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , told that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multip@@ lied . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service showed that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday while still ra@@ ining in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ te near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will reach record levels throughout the weekend . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could be floo@@ ded many homes in the subur@@ bs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; it also said that a stream @-@ stream flood in Ascen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers flow only slowly into Lake Mau@@ re@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 0@@ 9.00 the highest level ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still feed people from flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rising overnight . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives nearby , had warned him . &quot;
&quot; we woke up and the water po@@ ked and po@@ ked in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years , where she lived there . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a good thing to do with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since there continued heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , the authorities hes@@ itated to consider ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;

the authorities reported that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and street floo@@ ds caused residents to save residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that there were 200 floo@@ ded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa .

&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to flood water and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to take care , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;

this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ down said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be floo@@ ded , but there were no reported on Friday . &quot;

&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; survi@@ ves fo@@ undry in Philadelphia &quot;
the police conf@@ is@@ cated that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered multiple abuse , including in the lung , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in hospital in his transportation to hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transm@@ itter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transm@@ itter with that he is likely to recover again .
he would have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
&quot; also , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was shot at the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who was found in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transm@@ itter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators could be .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; - Carl S@@ agan &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continuation of the ongoing battle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the pav@@ ement , were logged . &quot;
&quot; there are several armed fighters , who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; said police department Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no fixed arre@@ sts and the police currently reviewed reports , according to the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger on the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she re@@ covers and the police are still searching for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic banner and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been at every summer olymp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three turbin@@ es , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which was inspiring for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly rais@@ man , the Jewish is and Madison Ko@@ cian who is Catholic , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American . &quot;
&quot; last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were . &quot;
that shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and the American sport@@ s@@ men che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected , but master@@ ful gy@@ mas@@ tik@@ routine rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual who won gold in an individual multi @-@ competition event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly rais@@ one won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see sports classes throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic Team will have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , it is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot;
&quot; but reality looks like gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily in private train@@ ers , which are maintained by parents that are maintained for training , training , travel clothing , competitive and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
&quot; the majority of these gy@@ ms are in prosper@@ ous subur@@ bs , which can support the business . &quot;
&quot; in these clubs , gymn@@ asts get their whole training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we need to give the con@@ greg@@ ations au@@ n countless young girls that are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gym training . &quot;
I founded the foundation of 20 years .
&quot; in my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality turbin@@ es that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olymp@@ ic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and academic and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real portra@@ yal of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic Team of Team and thank you , you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors would like to organise more strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37@@ .000 assist@@ ants who voted for election were rejected . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt plans unveiled plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS found itself in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistant doctors will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work in order to improve the care for ast@@ ral times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chairman of the BM@@ A committee for assist@@ ants shared last night in a message : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have agreed to the proposed treaty as before serious concerns , in particular that it will address the current occupation crisis and it will be treated to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
&quot; efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through discussions with the government on the contrary , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
&quot; this was done by a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made it last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must act now , lift up the vibration and address the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistant doctors have made clear that they are ready to carry out more labor action measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and doctors were included to provide physicians on the strike post @-@ chain coverage . &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants to be a better incentive for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , demanded the assist@@ ants to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; labour action measures are not only a little , but have already over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare the patients , pa@@ w@@ lers and their families only wor@@ ries , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the committee of the assistant doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowing . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive engagement with other important topics - such as des@@ patch , flexibility in training , training c@@ ams , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the Ministry of Health in terms of compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from heart attacks every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty materials in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots are dissolved , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ log the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca , and mark@@ eted under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the ann@@ ular design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month consumption of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;

the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; thanks to a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft bill does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period .
the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness is blo@@ oming in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report due to corruption .
a culture of political correc@@ t@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is unknow@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les attacks verb@@ ally the police , election observers and town houses to ignore evidence of mis@@ use due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , who now is an antagon@@ ist , said that inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off bands outside of election cabins to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should take a certificate to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at the time , voters only have to name their name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person when they submit their vote , to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
why buy this report ? * Get a detailed picture of the Baby and Child @-@ specific Products market ;
he demands that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions of un@@ official comm@@ issions or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes hand in hand , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ ro@@ and@@ als in the East of London .
&quot; last year , a Special Court decided that the acting mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be en@@ acted according to Lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in cy@@ ni@@ cal manner and that he had brought his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a im@@ itation , in which one person was chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .

&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean@@ se the electoral system including the lead of evidence to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; &quot; as evidence has been indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerc@@ ised , especially women and young people , in accordance with the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pakistani or b@@ ang@@ lad@@ esch@@ ian background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... State institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations in order to clean@@ se the system , including the prohibition that political activists are editing brief@@ ings to stop &quot; &quot; election harv@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires even harder registration checks to prevent the election directory to be used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your passport .
do not use remote ink on the finger of a person as soon as they have left their voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are random .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter of letters .

requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fying the training , to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters will go alone in the election cabin . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the election tribun@@ al has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy to corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on the basis of the high requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; abor@@ tion controls &quot; &quot; of the voting rights regi@@ sters of the town halls . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country has a proud heritage than the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and dis@@ astro@@ us spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , she returned and leaving the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the outlet , pulled out their own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discre@@ et place to do it - she simply stood there , fre@@ ch like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , because she put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t fall back and went out .
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she watched someone watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants she had tried .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in Kent , said : &quot; &quot; how reluct@@ antly to think that someone would take under@@ pants with home that had a different person and they were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to draw the pieces out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had them and pulled them out and they were not washed .
&quot; a spokesman of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9th August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to Prot@@ ect Your@@ self with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safer for you .
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach from front or back , this video will show you how to turn your smo@@ ker off the sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; when you are approached from behind , you should first turn around so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; says M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you hit the face with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with his knees in the sli@@ ghtest and twist , while the attack@@ er com@@ eth in front of pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and align the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?

&quot; the present@@ er and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ab@@ ed his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a pur@@ ge of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the check @-@ in of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show itself and to show us what it is to be inserted . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the idea of rej@@ ecting the r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing was left behind what he ta@@ sted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Wright has been known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by eating through the world and ate won@@ dro@@ us and wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ cking of toilets , the task placed his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told me : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;

the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test scre@@ ed showed a L@@ umin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse after their lumin@@ escence was more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s coming to the worst thing I &apos;ve had in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I will not check here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; L@@ ass to call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon .
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
&quot; the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary , we could provide consumers with more information on an interesting way . &quot;
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film , added : &quot; let me tell me this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had told him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian aside , pun@@ ish them and others in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .

&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ im@@ itation with a loss of £ 50,000 , because they had terror@@ ised their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Sk@@ el@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock have been thrown into S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall after a long list of complaints . &quot;
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing cooperative shocked the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls were la@@ vis@@ hing holes , wooden floors were torn down , g@@ arbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was ador@@ ned on the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation .
&quot; Donna Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the administration of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to repair . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider because this property is probably considered not as beautiful part Corn@@ wall .
the family is in@@ famous and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who had meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had inf@@ lic@@ ted the family has included street fights with bas@@ eball bat , inti@@ mid@@ ation , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ cken and flu@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under certain circumstances , old trash was found &quot;

neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to call on the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall Housing Del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ ta was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They don &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to this !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have administ@@ ered the family with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the congregation , g@@ arbage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added , &quot; &quot; It is a shame that the ten@@ ants agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family because there is always the last step that Corn@@ wall Housing considers . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have been cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope this development will be donated to some neighbours and the message communic@@ ates that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Sk@@ el@@ don , who came to life in 2013 in a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after having been without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ced with gra@@ ffiti .
the police say that they will del@@ in@@ stru@@ ct ten@@ ants that don &apos;t stick to the house rules
&quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the del@@ im@@ itation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches , as well as those who were damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall Police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners in order to protect our communities .

&quot; sun wor@@ shi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ gu@@ ese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on air@@ strike aircraft laid an incredible crash
&quot; the Air Force forces announced that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no security risk &quot;
this was the moment in which fri@@ ghtened tourists started to panic when a jet flew over a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ot@@ ings showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the holi@@ day@@ makers jumped up when they began to worry about the noise of the trouble @-@ drives , without seeing what caused by the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were panic when the plane came out of darkness and incredibly low
the Portuguese Air Force forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokesman said that the jet lag behind the bad visibility is slightly lower than usual , but the air forces insisted that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; land fires destroyed part of the Portuguese mainland , where four people died on the island of Mad@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; today , the Portuguese Air Force forces announced that the pilot had to fly because of the conditions - strong fog and smoke - so deep flying , which limits his view . &quot;

the I@@ OC wants to set up a disciplinary mission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatening after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
&quot; after a rob@@ bery attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer to his home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee agreed to set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan official told that the former spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave an Ur@@ ine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership Ken@@ ias from the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has asked the I@@ OC for information about the case to tackle his own investigation and shared an IA@@ AF spokesperson .
&quot; depending on the outcome of the study and the following measures of the I@@ OC , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; said the IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and was issued and signed as F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich , the sample was handed and signed , &quot; &quot; said Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;

&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 Dop@@ ing target controls in front of the Rio Games , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the vis@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , W@@ AD@@ A took Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of the W@@ AD@@ A . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports , the ARD courts have repeatedly raised accus@@ ations that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there is a significant ment@@ ality of sports fraud . &quot;
I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in this way , it could prove that in this sport type it was surface @-@ cover@@ able and systematically mut@@ ed . &quot;

Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins &quot; masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth room .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ steins &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this stage , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she is reminis@@ cent of her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it &apos;s unusual musi@@ cally ! &quot;
and then it would be Mari@@ as &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , whom I have known as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; says Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous generous person .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli gives back the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a joy@@ ful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; in this piece , it is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;

London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , reportedly died in Syria . &quot;
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ m Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a in Syria a few weeks ago .
&quot; it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after her family , shortly after she had fores@@ een to leave the war @-@ captured country and to return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing lies - as a warning and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - people of having ever made this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school@@ girls from the East of London arrived in a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;

&quot; in 2021 , the country elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;

&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign close to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;

&quot; despite the crisis with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its inn@@ ate in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , which is brutal . &quot;
it is constantly being scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; according to the latest proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère sets out a thick safety package . &quot;
but what has a Dul@@ er status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconc@@ iled .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior at the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t blame anybody .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in this .
&quot; as the Minister of the Interior , however , it was located on results and in a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will submit a little time before he presents his conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 2 ) 1,9@@ 41 171 &quot;
&quot; some things are already known , proc@@ la@@ iming , proc@@ la@@ iming that a new security authority should take care of the attacks of encryp@@ ted communication , is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU specifications for passenger data and tru@@ ce .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is starting a second start for proposals that were not to be done with the SPD so far : he wants to make sympath@@ etic advertising for terrorist groups in punishment and ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; says the CDU man . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On September 3 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; in some cases , he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more opportunities to arrest people from deport@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; refugees who are targeted in the country are to check their smartphones in advance , and reveal social media accounts for a security check . &quot;
&quot; at Dul@@ les for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to face some even worse than until now - about such crimes committed or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of Ged@@ ul@@ lah , for example , the question arises : what does this actually mean to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ in@@ ators of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in the face of the high pressure of refugees , many people were worried about safety . &quot;
&quot; and things that the people are deeply concerned , let themselves not cl@@ amp@@ ed themselves in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in focus .

&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen also sees the possibility that customers will come to a workshop for half a year after conversion , and this can be attributed to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;

&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera as I walk in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and wild ge@@ stures before I stop , hold my hands and something pu@@ bic , like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ os is slowly in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent vendors were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation . &quot;

&quot; these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him at home ) , dress the walls of his room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and purchased items he sold , when he was young and ready . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early seven@@ ties that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
that is my vices .

&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of the record re@@ visions of a certain age .

&quot; even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ ually packed pop instead of experimental jazz is a good thing to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;

&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;

&quot; she does not deserve much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I admit to dis@@ embar@@ k the jeans @-@ hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who can group themselves for a moment about Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter decide to buy a cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; the left is a stair@@ case , a wall full of panels by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , essential records for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it &apos;s pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ os , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the stroll through plate shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ling gaze of an in@@ sidi@@ ous , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake present@@ er who sits on the shoulders of nothing of middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of tent@@ ative shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in case of a trial this week , the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be selling 72 provis@@ ional shops in which persons within the camp are selling goods , cigarettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ sers offer or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which harb@@ or a fire and security risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led out that the provis@@ ional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate 72 provis@@ ional transactions , but indicated that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , caf@@ és and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely to feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said the areas are peaceful meeting places between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated non @-@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; closing &quot; &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the recent eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of refugees living in the jungle has risen to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals over the summer . &quot;

&quot; Germany &apos;s lawn needs to be adjusted to the next generation of speed kni@@ ves : in different federal states , among other things in Hesse and Brandenburg , new flash@@ lights are tested , the Tem@@ po@@ unders are particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; for example , the futur@@ istic acting trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at the accident areas where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabili@@ t@@ ate bridges with passing speed , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary Bli@@ tzer for compliance with speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data are encryp@@ ted via a mo@@ dem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits , as well as access b@@ ans by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly experienced state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling . &quot;
&quot; in order that it is not simply cl@@ amp@@ ed , it is lowered in the measuring process , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also sh@@ atter @-@ proof outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bli@@ tzer from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; also foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;

&quot; the defeat was swe@@ ated by the not too bad comfort of the Silver Med@@ al - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;

Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning is inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
&quot; there will be no emot@@ ive gold than with these games , and that &apos;s what is called . &quot;
&quot; from the first rowing stop to the last , 220 hard hi@@ ves that go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Est@@ aci@@ o da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 39.@@ 4 un@@ defeated deployment , which is also exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the trium@@ ph@@ al . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in rowing , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and it was no one more comfortable than the trainer who didn &apos;t know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had a bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather aw@@ ful situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could start treating early 2014 , outside of the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right concept under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing of itself is already a challenge , but that makes it one even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a little more than anything else and trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was the main man in the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in an effort in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to coach or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , the p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let it rip apart .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking forward to making some ra@@ bies .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want a fireworks , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ ner group based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , supports approximately 15@@ 0,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; for further cities and municipalities , there are water supply contracts . &quot;
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Bürger@@ haus Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert was hired as a Wasser@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , she called the commission@@ ing and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land acquisitions in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the refur@@ bishment of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the moderni@@ zation of water pipes . &quot;
there has been no stagn@@ ation and I have always added new innovations because water lives and drinking water is the most important food .
&quot; in their lau@@ dation , she praised the faithful , reliable and correct service over the age of 31 . &quot;
he has worked with a lot of heart blu@@ t for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it would be his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was a real practition@@ er to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ner Group to reduce nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ conia . &quot;
&quot; for that , he received very much recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the other hand , praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best aqu@@ educ@@ ator and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ growing well @-@ being and the re @-@ structuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation , however , were the pi@@ ping at the high container at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3rd . &quot;
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees , we had to work throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; the supply of Neu@@ brunn can also be maintained once , because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;

steel - Light@@ view for German steel industry
the k@@ ris@@ ky @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial bur@@ dens that im@@ pending the industry from the green electricity promotion are from the table .
&quot; at the release of the Renewable Energy Agency in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Frei@@ tag@@ ode ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach this conclusion after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel producers , the gases from the blast furn@@ ace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
firm of the Year for Distribution and Fran@@ ch@@ ising Os@@ borne Clarke Firm of the Year for Employment Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer Firm of the Year for Insurance
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the gener@@ ators are replaced in the steel works , an E@@ EG ratio is 20 percent . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for its own production .
&quot; in this way , the status quo is largely written by the previous regulation . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have particular significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is the future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; another must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall head Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has suffered under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy as the world &apos;s largest producer of producers threw massive steel onto the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the import duties imposed on import steel have effect on import steel , and the economic prospects in China have been hal@@ ted . &quot;

&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and overall , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , they do something good about their health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can establish and nur@@ ture social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dis@@ solve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for that , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
anyone who asks his lungs regularly will not get out of the pu@@ rest in everyday life even in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Community of the Seni@@ ors organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure time . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people aw@@ ak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , demen@@ tia suff@@ ers from demen@@ tia to long @-@ distance events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm , and adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially elderly people who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I look for a long time for something , I will be better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing with singing , there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate to hesitate - even if he thinks of having little talent , he advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who h@@ ears when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of friends in a senior ench@@ or , you can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
&quot; if you want to sing in a church choir , you can directly contact the church or the church . &quot;
many senior &apos;s cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; if you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for every age .

&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it is said that the bombs were laid by enemies of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have received intelligence on im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
it is unclear what group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police dismissed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amus@@ ement parks . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge themselves against tourists . &quot;

increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were done a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution made by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country faces stability , improving economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , resi@@ des itself good to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;

this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , there had been reports about contacts of the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ t@@ arian &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ine said , &quot; &quot; He has no knowledge of this . &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant to a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with regard to the significant increase in law@@ suits and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and asylum seek@@ ers , Ma@@ ine said , he would not speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have noted in recent years that there can be legal @-@ backed structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it can be quite possible that other righ@@ tist groups or small groups form to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing extremis@@ m is not recogni@@ zable . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining . &quot;

&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for the shank , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ u , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp are nearly 20 years old . &quot;

the United States Central Command has altered intelligence information to sign an optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria .
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the armed forces , intelligence officers and military bud@@ get@@ ary com@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly cen@@ time , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information generated by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders typically recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed real conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened to the Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the guide errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed contin@@ ual problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government heads under Obama &apos;s instructions have given statements to change the reports , it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from their leaders to draw up an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Releases , comments and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it meets the facts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com was publicly announced that a military recon@@ quest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , second @-@ largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Congress MP from Kansas , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the mid @-@ year 2015 , Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
&quot; the report , published on Thursday , will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ com Reports are underway with the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
&quot; democratic members of the Intelligence Service Bureau published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; said the high @-@ ranking demo@@ crats in the Com@@ mit@@ ee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; Dam@@ aged the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ essi@@ vely little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the demo@@ crats did not have any hints to the White House intervention in the Cent@@ com Analy@@ sten regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the con@@ gres@@ ses were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general insp@@ ector , who were accepted by Cent@@ com analysts . &quot;
&quot; according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokesman of the Pentagon , expressed in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while investigations of the general insp@@ ector were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also said that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions about interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense gre@@ et a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have resulted in re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of the past year have raised the question how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is remembered more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a written piece about how the then government under George W. Bush met with the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq , and did little time to make thought about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , stating that the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries of the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , reported the Times in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ ight command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legis@@ l@@ ative because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in the Central Command .

&quot; both teams have qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ finals , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place in their group . &quot;
the first place will take a little longer to the strong Dutch women who will lead the other group .
&quot; as always , the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising twist by their success story four years after they landed at the last of 12 places on the last of 12 seats . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time playing hockey ra@@ cket in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team all went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to a better place . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ places in London we have now .
we have to pull the ru@@ dder completely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the doors in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand from the close range . &quot;
&quot; India was without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flank , then moved into the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate for the Americans to gain a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to reserve a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; in Rio de Janeiro , the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and un@@ avo@@ idable , a fast Staff@@ ord@@ on between competition and aspi@@ ration . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is enough to compete for gymn@@ as@@ tics for gymn@@ as@@ tics for gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queu@@ e in the coff@@ e@@ eshop , without listening to Simone Schröder , K@@ atie Le@@ ut@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympics and a black with dimples , could have been among those familiar names that are sent to the Prime Time , set up by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV adver@@ ts if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even f@@ encing . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympics . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognised : gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the bre@@ ast@@ stroke and may reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se for the last 16 years that many people that I had asked did not know that there is an Olympic sport at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ oline jumping and has had an ath@@ lete until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline jumping has a certain out@@ break charm , partly because it sounds like the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a c@@ low@@ se school that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a little enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the car@@ eless trem@@ bling of its never ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gym and diving , which combines two sports that are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; jumping board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; rising winners jump on a giant tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ unters and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; they are assessed according to official Olympic program according to design , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other . &quot;
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold , med@@ alli@@ sts must go forward to gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and back , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in the TV transmission another cave goal : the world or the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ directed aspi@@ ration is no@@ bel , admi@@ rable , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it &apos;s enough to stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I find myself when watching these games as a little ti@@ ring .
the tramp@@ oline offers a resp@@ ite break .
the vector of the tramp@@ oline jumping is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualifying and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final hours as part of a follow @-@ up block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; when the increasing awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by ang@@ ling and the object of male athletes - as the male US gymn@@ asts hit the Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his following air channel , new fan community . &quot;

&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country , and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa by the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;

&quot; American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia is everything else than a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continued repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissi@@ dents effective to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ la , a lect@@ urer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to saus@@ age in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a far @-@ reaching vote last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , disputed line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who were more or less forced over the past few years , could exploit tur@@ mo@@ il and re@@ arm themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of in@@ toxic@@ ation are now explo@@ ding under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially for protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave their attention to the protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; eu@@ c @-@ jp ( Japanese , Unix ) shift _ j@@ is ( Japanese , Win / Mac ) iso @-@ 2022 @-@ jp ( Japanese , email ) &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are involved in coordin@@ ating under a umbrella , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts about 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly honored to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them harm@@ less .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analyst . &quot;
&quot; eu@@ c @-@ jp ( Japanese , Unix ) shift _ j@@ is ( Japanese , Win / Mac ) iso @-@ 2022 @-@ jp ( Japanese , email ) &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of poll@@ s prot@@ ested against the government and were stolen by the government and were stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent raid , many protesters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months , and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
&quot; but obviously , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal de@@ priv@@ ation of the Ethiop@@ ian government . &quot;
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , protests in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ish city , led by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is increasingly common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests have brought the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a base for dar@@ ing flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently announced that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West obviously wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already vol@@ atile region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin gr@@ ate walk . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy that surro@@ unds his campaign by ang@@ ling that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gently with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his comrades who strive to protect him during an event@@ ful phase of protection , in the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump called back to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to indicate , the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; 9 : 08 PM , Jan 31st , 2014 via Twitter for Mac in reply to enn@@ om@@ ane &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the statement slightly by rec@@ alling it that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tried to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign for falling sales figures to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July , he moved strong criticism when he thought that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s email , but he later explained &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic barriers in politics , and then go back to demand . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ agu@@ ely enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more et@@ ched tone because its demand values have declined further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leading lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his provoc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is increasingly focused on the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provoc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent speakers , gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s testimony whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back@@ ben@@ ches , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an external minister , allowed ISIS to spread out by pushing the situation in the Middle East to control the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of taking around on each of his words and to be taken over against him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , e@@ un@@ u@@ chs &quot; TV experts trying to understand and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats mo@@ cked at Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once upon the price of the market , Café takes place in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were crowded . &quot;
&quot; the store So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , created in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
locals ran@@ ted it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ B@@ GB is dead , excluding Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it &apos;s also re@@ inv@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; a re @-@ animated Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when he offered a client to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ pres@@ so cabin model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ nish@@ es such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ cep@@ ans . &quot;
there are natural tear @-@ outs .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also ou@@ sted by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , Rebecca Oli@@ vei@@ ra was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ vei@@ ra , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while to drink coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b that pleased me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea instead of their usual Iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer . &quot;
&quot; he went there before the work , and inevitably ordered the same . &quot;
&quot; I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss bag clock and they prepare my Everything @-@ B@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes everything @-@ ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not believe that the soap business has taken hold of the old business area .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for verb with the cold @-@ roasted coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents of Green@@ point also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new client has translated the menu into Polish , and said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to make it out soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ shop wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ cooked coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new version is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed at the ground when the cafe closed .
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the bri@@ ck@@ ery felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch in the Oval Office . &quot;
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acies of Fi@@ fth Avenue as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water Tur@@ tle soup .
&quot; its menu on this day was a bit more modest : stuff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese kitchen in the United States , while bricks were told in their book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they met with a rep@@ orters at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snor@@ k@@ elling snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , prepared a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable dishes . &quot;
&quot; as the reporter h@@ acking hack@@ ed , this was fitting the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ uts , g@@ inger@@ bread and bean bread . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap , which stretches the ingredient . &quot;
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inned .
&quot; it must have been laid in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women bo@@ iling for male fel@@ dar@@ ts and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans , who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Meal &quot; &quot; marks the way that the country was going to be no longer the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , fragmented subject , &quot; Co@@ e told why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ tin diet : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ts have become basic stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way of re@@ covering food resi@@ due &quot; , &quot; as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry ob@@ st .
&quot; meat , which was the main focus of American cuisine for years , became a rarely used luxury . &quot;
&quot; unique mix@@ tures have been tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy common sense . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes , brick man prepared a dish out of this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions will not match each other .
it was typical for many of the domestic business recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever since , domestic econom@@ ists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by giving recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary politicians &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ ussy like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Meal &quot; is a celebration of historical delic@@ acies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ Cake @-@ Essen , are tasty . &quot;
&quot; while he public@@ ally praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen in his kitchen , he spoke like the millions @-@ man man from the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .

President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make a mark with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the host of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial preparations . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was thrown away as soon as the land came back . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; in writing the book , the couple had better understood eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded himself : &quot; you actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the pre@@ cip@@ itation of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they drew a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the President Roos@@ ev@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; it will be called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common plo@@ y to miss a nice name . &quot;

Gre@@ enland &apos;s shar@@ k : the oldest vert@@ eb@@ ra is almost 400 years old
( users Viewing this Forum : 0 ) 1 1
Gre@@ enland ha@@ ie usually only come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gre@@ enland ha@@ ie only got offspring with 150 years .
&quot; on average , the Gre@@ enland @-@ shar@@ k swim along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it is just 1.@@ 220 metres far on average . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; however , the lifestyle of lon@@ el@@ iness seems to be a pat@@ ent@@ age for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science , &quot; at least by a Gre@@ enland @-@ hai , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist probably assumed that Gre@@ enland ha@@ y will become st@@ ony . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Gre@@ enland ha@@ ie is difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Gre@@ enland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive only in winter . &quot;
HZ@@ I researchers discover control centres in Y@@ ers@@ inia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature
&quot; their time @-@ eag@@ erly , they were , when they equipped six animals in front of Spit@@ s@@ bergen , with a transm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; however , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another one had swal@@ lowed the ja@@ ws of a young polar bear . &quot;
maybe they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ ro@@ ls at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cad@@ aver removing from higher water layers down to the bottom .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Gre@@ enland ha@@ y to catch the fis@@ her between 2010 and 2013 from Gre@@ enland or Spitz@@ bergen as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ ers long , while the biggest 502 cen@@ timet@@ ers measured . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens core of the hair with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; after the birth of the sh@@ arks , this centre of the eye lens , the proteins contained in it , will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a remarkable amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; in the early 1960s , their birth was supposed to lie in the atmosphere as a nuclear weapon @-@ seeking greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; with 220 cen@@ timet@@ ers of length , the lens nucle@@ us contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all the larger Gre@@ enland ha@@ y had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ off @-@ 14 @-@ watch for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timet@@ ers long Gre@@ enland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ timet@@ ers might be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
that Gre@@ enland @-@ hai @-@ females then get their offspring when they are longer than four meters .
&quot; now , the researchers were able to as@@ sign the length of an age . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold for sexual maturity and its age was determined in 156 years , Gre@@ enland ha@@ y is apparently at least one and a half centuries time . &quot;
this should also be the world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
the fact that such meth@@ us@@ cans live above all in icy waters is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Gre@@ enland w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on on the neck , stuck a 120 year old har@@ poon tip , was captured in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there is often running on a flame . &quot;
they mature later - and al@@ tern slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal feeds warmth . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram elephant .

&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media u@@ pro@@ ar after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed Israeli pres@@ election since there were Arab guests , according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust story &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last visit , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s country selection list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel eliminated and extingu@@ ished ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel through a call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director addressed the hotel recep@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was an &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot;
the reason that stood behind was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ selection is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; the cler@@ ks of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet , in which people called the whole affair . &quot;
some under@@ min@@ ed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been given the alleged &quot; Arab guests &apos; request .
&quot; ash@@ amed , &quot; &quot; it was in another article where it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a syn@@ agogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel soon proved all accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order not to include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
added that the country code has now been added .

&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Tehran in the year comparison by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted up against Iran , the interest in Russian enterprises was growing strongly in the country , divided by the ambass@@ adors . &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade building is one of the biggest priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and rose $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade up@@ swing was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes to Russia for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation was about 3@@ 5,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the number of tourist arri@@ vals in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting cities Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ined last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in London . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie staff &apos;s driver .
they did this in time as a sign .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man they stayed when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who prev@@ ailed four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner set an Olympic record in qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
&quot; but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front , and Sk@@ inner kept it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a big part of the transformation , driven in a higher gear to slow down it and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell into Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they went on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name .
we have placed an Olympic record in the final round and the world champion is defeated .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , he was visi@@ bly disappointed after a weak start . &quot;
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England &apos;s rivals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory this time , there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags at the tribun@@ e like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have so many world titles so bad that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ o@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was born just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - mean a total of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be equal to Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ st competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometres . &quot;
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the target . &quot;
&quot; the world record , won 2012 in London Gold , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .

future of the melt @-@ processing of Port@@ land due to the aboli@@ tion of the energy contract question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places by workers - stand at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus raises the supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced . &quot;
&quot; this step followed by the decision of the government in Victoria beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the plant &apos;s operation . &quot;

up to 2000 work@@ places in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk at closing .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt @-@ up consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity production of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;

the melt @-@ out of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ked a closing .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ on with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company Ci@@ tic and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; said the company . &quot;

&quot; the contracts have a 12 month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;

&quot; K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes her what the Vog@@ ue cover is concerned , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , which is more similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller ( 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) . &quot;
the disclosure of his coin will be eag@@ erly a@@ waiting that in the last two years the magazine se@@ amed images of the magazine even before the official announcement .

&quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ rities who model@@ n &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ rities &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs J@@ enner is described as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always a bit ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret Model , Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did , critici@@ zed the mist@@ ress of the moment . &quot;
these feelings bo@@ arded up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but on the mis@@ fortune it seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .

&quot; community centers have 16@@ 0,000 people annually &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid needs are rejected annually by the Municipal Coun@@ cils , while the industry has taken on the effects of further medium @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , there are already three out of five people - mostly elderly , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ in@@ qu@@ ents and similar - at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ looked , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the Director of Que@@ bec@@ a James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Union of Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ ors revealed that thousands of people are dismissed every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a suspension of the resolution of the German government would be even worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need will be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and de@@ pressing debts , families who were divor@@ ced by separ@@ ations , workers who were un@@ just dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we demand the general federal prosec@@ utor and federal jus@@ tices , as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , to promp@@ tly raise these short@@ cuts , so people can get the help they need , in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their customers , and that the government invested in this important work . &quot;

&quot; the incident is described in an indictment charged by Vincent Bord@@ ini on Wednesday , a former software progra@@ mmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini announced to have waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realised that &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring about renewal and prosperity throughout the country .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as it was in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we will create 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of London in 2012 , there will be such ones that will be considered that the challenge of expanding He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ellers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers each question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and in the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion investment programme in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two @-@ frequ@@ ented mil@@ eage . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third mil@@ eage , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as guarant@@ e@@ eing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

woman at suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police proc@@ laim witnesses , after a woman in the early hours of the morning , on Thursday at a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred on the A1 , near Mor@@ ges in the cant@@ on of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight . &quot;
&quot; a woman slept in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss resident in the age of 49 years , who was convicted of several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said to report them as well as any witnesses of the incident . &quot;
&quot; a preliminary investigation has been opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve at Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avo@@ idable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver is not responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which one person was running on the highway , it was decided that drivers would not have to assume that a pedestrian was running in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of negli@@ gence after having passed and killed a man who was near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become un@@ conscious on the road .
&quot; the court stated that the polic@@ eman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- to a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street had a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Mor@@ ges should register at the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
climate change as an impulse for the economy : paths to a climate @-@ neutral city
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate scientists .
&quot; the model has been designed to determine if the Venus with its hot , water @-@ free surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have imposed d@@ similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and still turned on slowly . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected against rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its latitude for the sun for almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io explained in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , creating a thick layer of clouds , which works like an umbrella , to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degree cooler than those of the Earth today . &quot;
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bled the evolution of plan@@ etary scientists .
&quot; in the course of several billions of years , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
their oc@@ eans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today . &quot;

we will keep a few full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks that will start the beginning next year to re@@ start the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has short@@ ened the rates to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;

&quot; energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation , which was strengthened by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish Parliament committee Dave Anderson met with workers leaders in the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest problems in the North Sea .
&quot; the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ aden
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Star of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star cluster are rot@@ ated to different rates , as well as in the context the rotation time spaces with plan@@ etary exploration . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star clusters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ aden is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
you are now on the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars come out large quantities of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of any failure by det@@ ecting the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- det@@ ects .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas quicker rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare the stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; we want to learn more about how to slow down and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates , so to speak their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has claimed 27 million US dollars each year . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - in full salary . &quot;

&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old will not be recorded in the concert hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Ro@@ d &quot; &quot; - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside of the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star appeared at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 banned ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to the involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the prime suspect to have received high @-@ performing funds for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favour for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days run not no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win every game , &quot; said Y@@ ank@@ ees Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married with the actress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson said , sympathy is the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;

&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a fri@@ ghtening rapid evolution of malware , &quot; explained Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ Books were designed to send adverti@@ sements . &quot;
&quot; then , the perpet@@ rators found black@@ mail software for themselves . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches for un@@ recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; after that , the software presents the demands of black@@ ma@@ iler . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; but where in private users the personal photo database is on the game , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware will strike . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were already victims of attacks that could be acute by the loss of medical records . &quot;

&quot; they explain their victims per chat , as they can pay per bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites or de@@ code freely for example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private individuals are rede@@ emed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must deal hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encryp@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four persons . &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their malware software in the form of a software building kit to the real black@@ ma@@ ilers .
&quot; the database of Schu@@ ett@@ gut@@ Portal contains company information , events on the calendar , the l@@ ates news and job vacancies . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a custom@@ ization tool so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and branding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ iler then searches for further hack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; so in one of the forums in the underground , you buy the set of a criminal and comm@@ issions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is done per inf@@ ested calcul@@ ator .
&quot; in general , criminals then commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

&quot; in the future , the perpet@@ rators could take entirely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;

&quot; in the middle of the winter , the release of such a block@@ aded heating would certainly be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , who has set up the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes to visit the cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most young@@ sters of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations would have been possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ häuser Wester@@ berg , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will receive the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
children and Famili@@ es in the field of theatre and theat@@ ric@@ ality are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the rise in refugees , the association pays off with many classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star@@ ters : hope to improve weather conditions
&quot; the weather has taken the star @-@ bu@@ zz@@ ing Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the Sou@@ thwest of Germany in the night on Friday , but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain , to watch the spectacle spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night on Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many star@@ ters at the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ ri@@ bs are per@@ sil@@ ds , which belong to the fastest star@@ ters with 216@@ ,000 kilometres per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips on sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces
&quot; in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning there is no more sleep in the morning before the alarm bell rings . &quot;
that &apos;s all other than relaxing .

why buy this report ? * Get a detailed picture of the Consumer Health market ;
&quot; there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there can be many reasons underlying it , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter we@@ eß , member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;

what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can be found behind them , but also drugs . &quot;
&quot; not rarely , the sleep disorder is an expression of another condition . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
and it can be that different factors need each other .
&quot; for example , anyone who has a disc her@@ nia can be bad , every two to three hours will wake up and begin to gre@@ et about everyday problems and care , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should sleep distur@@ b@@ ance to the doctor ?
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : you are beaten , tired , exhausted , has difficulties with al@@ ert@@ ness and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping pills can only occur in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire . &quot;
&quot; Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , is hardly available in Germany . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; this can be clari@@ fied with investigations , if the problems have a physical cause . &quot;
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example in snor@@ ing with breathing exercises , for example in snor@@ ing with breathing exercises , for sleeping problems or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation . &quot;
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch break , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the cab@@ ling , one goes to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electro@@ des on the body , one wears a nose g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a feel@@ er on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera has a camera on the ceiling . &quot;
how can affected persons get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that you can make for a better sleep .
&quot; it counts on : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed , not to sleep on the day , not watch TV to fall asleep , alcohol avo@@ ids and at night not look at the watch - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and this is absolutely not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;

&quot; the funding system in the swimming sport is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look exactly at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be stopped here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before the first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly what you should do with countries .

&quot; on the first glance , the street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not seem so , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you walk along the east to the west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; on the faç@@ ade of a grey house someone has &quot; ugly , &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; for this reason , the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents of le@@ ased contracts , on the ground floor , are still occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel had spoken repeatedly for a hard action of the police against the project , called the &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ ter@@ s@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers cleared , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks ago , with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on site , locked sections of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , building workers were commissioned by the unknown household owner . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of houses in the sun , others are talking to Pre@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ wing violence is not the main issue of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and Jana * , who is here for three children , are primarily gener@@ alized by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising ten@@ ants and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wants a majority of police protection against the v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the tren@@ ches , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police between house occup@@ ants and their neighbours , apparently did not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood , which even today , compared to the rest of the city , has a lower average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been swept under large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in Riga will be attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them in the windows or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which have been disc@@ arded with color bags . &quot;
&quot; no other street was mentioned in this year as often as &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbors to see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality , according to statistics such as body injury , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , uncertainty cannot be a question of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is more important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not determined . &quot;
&quot; the famous burning cars , too , give it no more to Riga . &quot;
&quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal record , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is aware of the Riga road - and has remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that the residents with@@ drew their street : from the police , politics and the media , which all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be removed : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former construction sites , who are pushing the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are property @-@ apartments , which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well @-@ bet@@ tered , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if someone does not listen to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer : the building projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; if you prefer , you should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub neighborhood that can complain about noise . &quot;

so the main and honor@@ ary community must look out for activities in the region and in the region .
