<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin adopts his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if it had never happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>

<seg id="16">"it was even greater, since it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"to rebuild the veto, it will be difficult if not impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, state-controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the serious, accusations from leading officials, that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemence.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to reserve a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the first line, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after the last month in a failed coup d'état."</seg>
<seg id="28">Retrieved 16 March 2010. (archived at WebCite)</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West because its reaction to the attempted takeover of power was regarded as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the ongoing debate about the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pivot is to draw benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian State of State won a bonus for the attempted coup d'état in Ankara following the attempted coup d'état."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, which is even a deep-seated fear of regimitation."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray the" "alliance of outsiders" ": two countries, who hide from the West and feel badly treated and now allied themselves."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently been part of the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents were saying that they did not even seize the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentionally avoided a question of its differences, while Putin decided to emphasize that."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are at least talking together."</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin released his staff Sergey Ivanov unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was a part of Putin's closest confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a statement by the Kremlin, it is that Putin ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been the deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born 1972 in Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin, it is called (in Russian) that he later was a protocol chief and chief executive of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on his appointment, he said to Putin:" thank you for your confidence. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of head regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convincing the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidentials, working as he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>

<seg id="18">"but despite the ridiculousness of the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one knows no one at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once had been praised as a potential president who would like to conduct the Russian environmental policy - met great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," It is true that I asked you to talk to me at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complained posts for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been president of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>

<seg id="2">"by May 2017, the £1,35 billion will be completed by May 2017"</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have joined the North deck of Queensferry Crossings via the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "deckchairs", "which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"by May 2017, the £1.35 billion will be completed by May 2017."</seg>
<seg id="8">Business Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry Crossings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closing between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a hot activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fitting."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, almost 79% of the total bridge-endecks are at their place and the final section of the deck is now received in Rosyth's deck, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first shutter is a significant milestone in each bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high and deep engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installation of the last street closure and its connection with the Nordtower deck, we had to close the gap to the north or the country side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern supply bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very hot activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, because the viadukt is 222 meters long, weighs about 60,000 tons and has to be drawn up by an incline of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"as the tolerances, on which the team works, they were tiny - on each side they only used a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the women's olympic banner and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been at every summer olympiade since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, which was inspiring for many young girls of other skin color."</seg>

<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">"last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were."</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and the American sportsmen cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they expected, but masterful gymastikroutine routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual who won gold in an individual multi-competition event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly raisone won silver.</seg>

<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympic Team will have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, it is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but reality looks like gymnastics are an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily in private trainers, which are maintained by parents that are maintained for training, training, travel clothing, competitive and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the majority of these gyms are in prosperous suburbs, which can support the business."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, gymnasts get their whole training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we need to give the congregations aun countless young girls that are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible gym training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded the foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report due to corruption.</seg>

<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes hand in hand," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets Wahlroandals in the East of London.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place but this video from Dailymail.com could make it safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">"we spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach from front or back, this video will show you how to turn your smoker off the skewer."</seg>
<seg id="5">"when you are approached from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the shot line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit the face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then hit him with his knees in the slightest and twist, while the attacker cometh in front of pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight on the weapon and beat the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and align the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and Würteneflex of a serious test - by rejecting some of the most dirty and disgusting places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shabed his course on a euro note, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a purge of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before the check-in of each object, he used a Luminometer to show itself and to show us what it is to be inserted."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the idea of rejecting the rinsing knob of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing was left behind what he tasted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright has been known to test the resilience of his intestines by eating through the world and ate wondrous and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to railway stations to rinsing knocking of toilets, the task placed his immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told me:" already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test screed showed a Luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse after their luminescence was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "That's coming to the worst thing I've had in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not check here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "Lass to call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary, we could provide consumers with more information on an interesting way."</seg>
<seg id="29">I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film, added:" let me tell me this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian aside, punish them and others in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of tentative shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in case of a trial this week, the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be selling 72 provisional shops in which persons within the camp are selling goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdressers offer or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which harbor a fire and security risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups, not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate 72 provisional transactions, but indicated that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely to feed people who live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the areas are peaceful meeting places between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp to her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in Lehramt University, she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular interaction, seniors can establish and nurture social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure time."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, dementia suffers from dementia to long-distance events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm, and adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially elderly people who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I look for a long time for something, I will be better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing with singing, there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate to hesitate - even if he thinks of having little talent, he advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of friends in a senior enchor, you can easily connect."</seg>

<seg id="2">The United States Central Command has altered intelligence information to sign an optimistic view of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the armed forces, intelligence officers and military budgetary commites, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, shortly centime, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information generated by high-level Centcom commanders typically recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed real conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened to the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The guide errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed continual problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government heads under Obama's instructions have given statements to change the reports, it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from their leaders to draw up an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Releases, comments and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it meets the facts." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom was publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, second-largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, it is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress MP from Kansas, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the mid-year 2014 to the mid-year 2015, Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after them that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report, published on Thursday, will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of Centcom Reports are underway with the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"democratic members of the Intelligence Service Bureau published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "said the high-ranking democrats in the Commitee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, as Mr. Schiff, delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "Damaged the morals under analysts and" "gave excessively little space for different opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats did not have any hints to the White House intervention in the Centcom Analysten regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the congresses were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were accepted by Centcom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, expressed in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while investigations of the general inspector were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also said that" experts sometimes have diverging opinions about interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense greet a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have resulted in repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of the past year have raised the question how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is remembered more than ten years ago, as a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a written piece about how the then government under George W. Bush met with the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq, and did little time to make thought about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in insurrection against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker, stating that the government's statements against the refineries of the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, reported the Times in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damalight command, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">"one day after having shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said that she could not remember that ever."</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, she knows her: the Americans are at 4-0 in the olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Briton in the first place, which remains unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">America's strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans-Atlantic security partnership</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place in their group."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take a little longer to the strong Dutch women who will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always, the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising twist by their success story four years after they landed at the last of 12 places on the last of 12 seats."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time playing hockey racket in her hands (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team all went wrong."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to a better place."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workplaces in London we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have to pull the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday evening, Bam opened the doors in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close range."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lute the ball into the gate for the Americans to gain a 2-0 lead."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in Rio de Janeiro, the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and unavoidable, a fast Staffordon between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is enough to compete for gymnastics for gymnastics for gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue in the coffeeshop, without listening to Simone Schröder, Katie Leuty or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympics and a black with dimples, could have been among those familiar names that are sent to the Prime Time, set up by sponsors and feel-good TV adverts if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognised: gun shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse for the last 16 years that many people that I had asked did not know that there is an Olympic sport at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and has had an athlete until 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outbreak charm, partly because it sounds like the unenlightened ear for a clowse school that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a little enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the careless trembling of its never ending impact - but also the Grazie of gym and diving, which combines two sports that are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" jumping board. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"rising winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, hunters and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are assessed according to official Olympic program according to design, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-and-a-half athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold, medallists must go forward to gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and back, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in the TV transmission another cave goal: the world or the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-directed aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to stir up a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find myself when watching these games as a little tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumping is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualifying and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final hours as part of a follow-up block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympia-Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when the increasing awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by angling and the object of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts hit the Wall Street Journal recently, Mr. Dooley anticipates his following air channel, new fan community."</seg>

<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia is everything else than a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continued repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effective to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Tesla, a lecturer in central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to sausage in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-reaching vote last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, disputed line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were more or less forced over the past few years, could exploit turmoil and rearm themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of intoxication are now exploding under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially for protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave their attention to the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"euc-jp (Japanese, Unix) shift _ jis (Japanese, Win / Mac) iso-2022-jp (Japanese, email)"</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in coordinating under a umbrella," "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts about 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in a non-publicized illness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly honored to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"euc-jp (Japanese, Unix) shift _ jis (Japanese, Win / Mac) iso-2022-jp (Japanese, email)"</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of polls protested against the government and were stolen by the government and were stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the subsequent raid, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months, and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">"but obviously, this did not prevent the intensification of the internal deprivation of the Ethiopian government."</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protests in Gondar, an amharish city, led by Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray is increasingly common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests have brought the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a base for daring flights over the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently announced that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West obviously wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin grate walk."</seg>

<seg id="2">(users Viewing this Forum: 0) 1 1</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haie usually only come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland haie only got offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">"on average, the Greenland-shark swim along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour it is just 1.220 metres far on average."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the lifestyle of loneliness seems to be a patentage for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science, "at least by a Greenland-hai, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this means that the resource in question identified itself as" "XHTML 1.0 Strict" "and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in fact, the evolutionary biologist probably assumed that Greenland hay will become stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haie is difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">HZI researchers discover control centres in Yersinia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time-eagerly, they were, when they equipped six animals in front of Spitsbergen, with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"however, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another one had swallowed the jaws of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleeping animals or patrols at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cadaver removing from higher water layers down to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland hay to catch the fisher between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Spitzbergen as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimeters measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens core of the hair with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"after the birth of the sharks, this centre of the eye lens, the proteins contained in it, will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"in the early 1960s, their birth was supposed to lie in the atmosphere as a nuclear weapon-seeking greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"with 220 centimeters of length, the lens nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all the larger Greenland hay had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-off-14-watch for a 493 centimeters long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-hai-females then get their offspring when they are longer than four meters.</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign the length of an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold for sexual maturity and its age was determined in 156 years, Greenland hay is apparently at least one and a half centuries time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that such methuscans live above all in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland wal, in whose bacon on the neck, stuck a 120 year old harpoon tip, was captured in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is often running on a flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal feeds warmth."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very big animal should invest more in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner rained last night in the men's team Sprint in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medalists."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in London."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie staff's driver.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a sign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man they stayed when they saw the potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny - who prevailed four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the Duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but Kenny brought the team to the front, and Skinner kept it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a big part of the transformation, driven in a higher gear to slow down it and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell into Skinner, Kenny and Hinder, when they went on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have placed an Olympic record in the final round and the world champion is defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, he was visibly disappointed after a weak start."</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory this time, there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels like the whole GB flags at the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have so many world titles so bad that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velorom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is in the area of the possibility that he repeated Hoys's win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"this would mean for Kenny - who was born just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23 March (a apparently holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - mean a total of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be equal to Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medallist competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="39">They came in 3: 51,942 at the target. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, won 2012 in London Gold, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had fought yesterday with officers before the qualification, when they called him functionaries to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women competition, tomorrow continued and ended, Laura von Trott, Joanna Rowell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong web-bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a shar to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Dramas played in the background, such as the resignation of the technical manager Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sexism and bullets, as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, when one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite like that the legendary call GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss resident in the age of 49 years, who was convicted of several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police said to report them as well as any witnesses of the incident."</seg>

<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something that the prosecutor must decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver is not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - in which one person was running on the highway, it was decided that drivers would not have to assume that a pedestrian was running in the middle of the night on the motorway, as it was in the newspaper."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model has been designed to determine if the Venus with its hot, water-free surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have imposed dsimilar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and still turned on slowly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected against rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its latitude for the sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of clouds, which works like an umbrella, to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result is average temperatures, which are some degree cooler than those of the Earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembled the evolution of planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the course of several billions of years, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years."</seg>

<seg id="27">"in fact, it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a lunch break," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cabling, one goes to bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one wears a nose goggles, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger."</seg>

<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, uncertainty cannot be a question of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is more important: people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not determined."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the famous burning cars, too, give it no more to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, her street is not a criminal record, on the contrary:" here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is aware of the Riga road - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason, it was also so important that the residents withdrew their street: from the police, politics and the media, which all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be removed: through faceless new buildings in former construction sites, who are pushing the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are property-apartments, which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well-bettered," "she says."</seg>
