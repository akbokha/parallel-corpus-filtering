Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement development and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu a lack of will in the peace process .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial talk on the invitation of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly as aff@@ ront of Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not ab@@ duc@@ ted with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the immediate election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor tries to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told him that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lam@@ b was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officers found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school site , where he was shot and killed by the police , a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tk@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lam@@ b made the fatal emergency call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took his life , when the police seized him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , the students and lect@@ urers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lam@@ b motiv@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state have published details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were rejo@@ icing on his classes .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have history of violence or criminal background . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both subordin@@ ated in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which comprises 17 members , and many students visited the courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lam@@ b praised , said he seemed a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something is wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; before the Delta State University , Lam@@ b had asked for a reference for health reasons and said that he had any health problem . &quot;
&quot; in this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in employment policy of the university were meant that the promotion , for which Lam@@ b had worked so hard for him , would not provide a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lam@@ b cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later found a trail when he arrived in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lam@@ b killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ ane Johnson . &quot;
his car ran into the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; Lam@@ b began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he graduated in ped@@ agog@@ y in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 , when she met together with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach the guitar playing . &quot;
he was at the time of the wom@@ b .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously a few of the time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lam@@ b said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , he never met Lam@@ b , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up two years ago , Lam@@ b met both on a summer fair . &quot;
later they played one or another gig together .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter , and sings her own music . &quot;

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will make violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief urges once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ tt@@ ed that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;

some have tried to brand it as a flo@@ p .
others have done him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks of surveys down , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s lead was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain in 2011 , of which none of them won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but outside groups such as J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to leave their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current surveys that indicate that the Real Estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :

&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Establi@@ sh@@ ments , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump refuses to critic@@ ise its bomb@@ astic and ins@@ ulting statements , 52 per cent of the Iranian voters believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul is the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week , the same number is valid in the first state of state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament not pas@@ se into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they put their money back , Republican voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if you are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CNN / ORC , last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would gain the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump beats almost every one . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ umps , while the anti @-@ dr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University early September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ esting majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally edge Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a short majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have fixed their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much has happened to change this , and nobody can really say never to change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , tr@@ umps are strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump called in his election campaign two months ago immigrants from Mexico , &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; was the immigration of shooting and fishing in public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bomb@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump decisive His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and will damage the new @-@ oriented efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; as long as immigration is left in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s on new high@@ s .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , some half of the support of Republican voters , especially due to their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ strated by the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent . &quot; &quot;

champion League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; a happy hits from Thomas Müller made the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ akos Pir@@ äus - then it ran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sovereign pre@@ lude to the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the witch chair of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;
&quot; the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their bu@@ oy@@ ancy game in the Champions League at the Greek record meister Olympi@@ akos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) , with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; the twel@@ fth start of the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
&quot; in his 28 hits in the Champions League to Bavaria @-@ leadership , Müller received good help from Olympi@@ akos @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left one as a f@@ lange of thought of the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Kapitän Philipp L@@ earned prior to the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without sh@@ outing .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six games in the Royal Class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their open efforts , they often go to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often caused by playing bearing on the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely went through against the former Braunschweig Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand , Müller had more luck than his flan@@ ks of the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion promised the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; then by direct withdrawal , the Tor@@ wart Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 35@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; although the war@@ lords were acc@@ ustom@@ ed to their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set needle @-@ pins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , when he had a shot of ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te pul@@ ls ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; before New , Guardi@@ ola made a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , back to mus@@ cular problems in the Ka@@ der , sat at first . &quot;
&quot; after finishing the final training , the World Cup hero said Matthias Sam@@ mer said &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; who wants to make something else , this is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; in the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in front of the game , it was at the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of some war@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience bloc apparently prov@@ oked the followers of host pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and ge@@ stures , the security forces attacked and went on strike against the Munich followers . &quot;
at least one Bavaria fan was injured from the stadium .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said the Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ ström . &quot;
the Swedish government decided to introduce the proposal as European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is supposed to develop with 800 million people . &quot;

&quot; they should come to the same parts from the EU , the USA and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , there is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to raise obj@@ ections against jud@@ g@@ ments .

&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , which can en@@ force compensation of the tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws and en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act affir@@ med the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it has been critici@@ zed above all that they should not apply for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;

&quot; the Commission considered essential points for reform in the reform of the Federal Minister of Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;

the French government also welcomed the plans of Mal@@ m@@ ström .

&quot; since its election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the opening of the Prime Minister with tension is expected &quot;
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut at the opening of the Prime Minister and put himself to David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of his six questions shortly after noon and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from the vicinity .
he called &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech on the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the National hy@@ m@@ ne during a commem@@ orative ceremony for the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the centre of several titles stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ns has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party supported him as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the political correspondent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within Labour , &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith said that the party &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; was that it was only against government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory boss in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions of Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the question@@ nai@@ res of the prime minister is to be conc@@ eal , and that it has both &quot; &quot; perc@@ ei@@ ving &quot; &quot; and stri@@ pping with re@@ sist@@ ors , and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on the move abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre . &quot; but a few years later he decided that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was broadcast on television first in 1990 , the question@@ naire was considered the most important barometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build brand I@@ GA by mainstream marketing and marketing on social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA shops rehear@@ s@@ als and store owners who sell tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it will be expected that Met@@ cash will be released for further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale traders for food , alcohol and devices are going through its annual investors strategy ag . &quot;
&quot; it is much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia are almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profits than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the East states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ aser in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern Australia . &quot;

forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said , &quot; &quot; The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost around 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business grew by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Magellan Financial Group , announced a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ alers spend more than 150 million dollars in order to improve selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week to improve their stores through faster growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in 2017 , Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says that the wholes@@ alers in 2017 will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in 2017 . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly more praise for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; gr@@ inned by the not@@ orious struggle of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the arbit@@ rators : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Cy@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a Kra@@ mp@@ f failed to defend a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; a matter of which I &apos;m quite dig@@ ni@@ fied , is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was a little in the stri@@ fe , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from Fr@@ ust himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has very well beha@@ ved in the US Open , even under the rather provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os on the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all around the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; some time outside of the ra@@ mp , in which he can only think about it , I think it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;

&quot; Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and ri@@ pped the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country , all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indig@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip on the street between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled down there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter on them , migrants &quot; op@@ ted &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian government police . &quot;
some referred to protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared , &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ences on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations bloc with a str@@ it@@ ous meeting in Brussels could not agree with a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would be able to record more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a bal@@ lot campaign of Brussels or his neighbors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , emer@@ gen@@ cies in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after leaving a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison ins@@ ults in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which occurred around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high of Za@@ uns , who left the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency state , &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters from Associated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also included two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia after a train wag@@ gon with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to press the data of people and pressed a crowd to push themselves up there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ figure lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the presidential post , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the pre @-@ election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more permanent in their election than those of the other candidates .

&quot; Clinton holds a great lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these origins have reduced . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage for democratic elect@@ ors under 50 years has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton still has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton had a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ al , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ election country say they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about her .
the views are stronger mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just like a quarter she would enthusias@@ tically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republican voters say about their candidate candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to deal with problems and elect@@ rol@@ ment are also cited .
&quot; since the vice @-@ president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the Wa@@ ag shell , 57 percent of the democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half , that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders its second choice . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den does not decide to channel on the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead in S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this number has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ c@@ est &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call on the elect@@ orate . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , no single Democratic candidate or a potential candidate for these voters would be unacceptable to these voters . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , provide good results with some important features of voters in the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts in the three candidates best in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the pre @-@ election see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Minister of Foreign Affairs , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that there is no overall impact on their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mostly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of ten who say that their views of Clinton are worse . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transportation to the hospital in September 2013 .
&quot; officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and has repeatedly been attacked while trying to take over a frozen field on a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital so the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to make his symptoms goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood , said Poli@@ tk@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of U@@ ten@@ sils began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood basically about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ tk@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning in his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy , Den@@ g repeated with bl@@ unt force injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;

&quot; a rise in interest comes , and the house will fall into the w@@ reck , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement could possibly be exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to this , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a view of historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can be vol@@ atile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to increase assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may be reflected in the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens to net interest rates . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the hei@@ ghtening cycle and the return of return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that didn &apos;t exist before and that could accelerate a recession . &quot;
most notable is that gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in terms of interest in the F@@ ed .

&quot; market participants took the whole year to an interest increase in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were judged to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the initial cycles of 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP took place and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ aving took place very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;

the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the sei@@ z@@ ure cycle , the bond returns immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to closer ties between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a fall of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analysts at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earnings curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing have expanded and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and wide , companies will benefit from the greater part of their business activities in the US , benefit from which interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as a rising dollar pays off their products on the global market and the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond positively to three months after an initial interest rise , &quot; said Goldman Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;

&quot; outside of pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see profits by higher yields , even though experts of different opinions are how quickly this will take place . &quot;

the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funeral destinations in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; according to the Ministry of Health , the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets in order to bury the victims killed when a crane in Mec@@ ca Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession took place at the Holy Site , where only days before a building cra@@ cked through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the end . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for funeral , when the Saudi king passed over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe , which left 3@@ 94 last , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 operators who were killed when a crane was stor@@ med by the Great Central Park Mec@@ cas , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the Kra@@ n . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual rab@@ ble in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that they will continue to go to the city of Mec@@ ca , with thousands who continue to go to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said , the bin Laden group would not have to stand the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; a Arab version of the decree , published by the state Saudi press Agency , said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man revealed what was caused by the fall of the crane that crashed into an inner courtyard of the Grand mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place in this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden group did not have any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ ad@@ ored the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project leading by the Bin Laden Group .
&quot; for decades , the Bin Laden family has been connected with the master &apos;s family of Saudi Arabia and takes over larger construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dec@@ eit@@ ful son , who was dischar@@ ged from the family in 1990 @-@ 2000 . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane was in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .

&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Open House , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; as a result of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence provided that the association was not at any point in the event of an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports facilities would have been charged for allow@@ ances and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and invested a lot of time and money - the pas@@ si@@ va bet@@ tered around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we lead the club or lock us ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the bread profession of the financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have proposed money to put our life insurance as safety at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said in the arrest . &quot;
&quot; with the association , it has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it must not be made any debts . &quot;

&quot; for this reason , one part of the allow@@ ance was only a year later , namely from 2003 when a plus was paid on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Pau@@ schal@@ - and not detailed reports appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the two def@@ endants filed together , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the United States and the United States have signed an agreement with the United States , the United States , Canada and the United States . &quot;
&quot; the association did not have any attention in detail for financial services , but it was important to have had the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; after all , he thought he had believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happened , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused have been informed , justi@@ fying the function@@ ary . &quot;

&quot; the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this form@@ ulation , because the club never had any damage to the club . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the function@@ ary , he never covered a cent salary , he only calculated mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; in di@@ eting , he added € 1,000 per month to the club , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added . &quot;
&quot; for the early years , exact documentation for the early years could not prove the def@@ endants . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US staff bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US staff on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to make the important decision whether the first time has raised interest rates for almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were interviewed by Reuters , found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do this now , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to remain a little longer and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has seven years since the F@@ ed Interest on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank possibly leaves the null area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , leading employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw view of global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point to that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday .

&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lam@@ b , lect@@ urer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , He shot a man and killed someone . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day , the police officer said that the police officers had to send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife yesterday evening . &quot; &quot; he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but no one will distur@@ b it , but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the attack@@ er to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lam@@ b gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lam@@ b , 45 , which said : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lam@@ b drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing him before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lam@@ b believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months for double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture in the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left outside distribution to we@@ eping and closing it for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
&quot; in the locker cabin , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and he will not play in the group stage . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the hanging of a penalty shoot .
&quot; Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al pres@@ umed that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a penalty and a red card are prone . &quot;
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a post on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;

&quot; Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving into another direction so that it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad at all . I &apos;m sorry .

certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a matter that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
&quot; it is for you , perhaps David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to be released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or a message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all beautiful and well , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron was supposed to describe the story of the book , added a content of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the mas@@ ked town of Th@@ ought @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , reads . &quot;
&quot; a young name Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he has admitted to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is a little familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most probably , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has read the Lor@@ ax not 20 times in a row of a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was likely to come from Camer@@ ons &apos;s electoral offices .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons was delivered , but there was no more immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the Ka@@ der , England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks &apos;s page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test plane , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; this message : Adam Ly@@ th fails to be replaced by the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple , but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aligned with results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I said this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully beats other runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t have such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is especially a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test stroke is received to make his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
the only accus@@ ation that you can elev@@ ate was that England first set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer I really appreciate . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which we met very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances of winning before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would bring an extra spin bow@@ ler and get four squ@@ alls , and I have nothing against it . &quot;

&quot; people may see its stats - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inn@@ akers that raise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen themselves for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes out for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for international cri@@ cket competition , as player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with the earlier singing . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not sure where you &apos;re getting your info , but great topic . I will definitely dig@@ g it and for my part recommend to my friends . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the timet@@ able . &quot;
&quot; and you must remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results . &quot;
such decisions are not taken lightly .

foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ acy fre@@ ak said that some member states , so deeply rooted in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from its own fault , Britain itself created the agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ ting changes that they usually don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided that it would not like to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they are allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wishes to look forward to the UK within the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us look at that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her as it looks for the exagger@@ ated long out@@ break like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ b@@ age ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also an allied force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nationalist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are going to be a leg to help the Sel@@ fie Brit@@ ons to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something that they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have to be used . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately plan not helpful comments , completely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend suspects . &quot;

&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I think it is friendly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blood @-@ arb@@ ant tendency and the wild plu@@ mage of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism may well say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the boy finder was fighting in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old , when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on Monday evening . &quot;

&quot; it is correct to give Cameron a free card for Europe , allowing him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;

experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England about e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; the claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes were less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , launched Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence presented by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
PH@@ E published the &quot; Basic Law Report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial in the Lanc@@ et &apos;s medical journal Lanc@@ et last month grip the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily strong foundation , &quot; based on PH@@ E its most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Trop@@ ical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking , &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to produce their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding that he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champions , some of which include a sector funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .

&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence is proof and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ .000 people die annually in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System for two billion euros a year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop playing programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programmes , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place a hard controversial time window against the popular shows of their rivals and Sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried to contact Channel 4 for six years without success with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; said Johnson to the upper haus communications committee in the framework of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I think about medium or long term does not matter for a good idea , you should at least put his production at least on programs that others do not do or put into commission . &quot;
they send The Voice to a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs are financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm to it . &quot;
I &apos;m tired of seeing how this public television should be .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame on the hunt for assessments &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they are prepared for their apparent missions to justify 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson told the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can obtain the best value .
&quot; of course , all of you think we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s true because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday said that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , to form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should be an example of the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make everything online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves

HZ@@ I researchers discover control centres in Y@@ ers@@ inia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature
the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes alter the direction in which they have sound impul@@ ses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impul@@ ses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
read more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms are usually not responding to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activ@@ ates the cells , which they are assigned , thus a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically altered the worms so that some of their mother@@ boards carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when ultrasound is applied to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transfer them into the worms , where they turn off the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities associated with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was aston@@ ished about the silence , which reig@@ ned around the publicity for the trade fair - through a void of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tender company advertisement , but &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the trade fair , &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Amnesty . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student resi@@ dences
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ et and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the felt sm@@ iles of those I have upset - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
enter multiple addresses separated by commas and / or different lines .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to che@@ er : people tell where you come from where you come to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; in contrast to those with whom you don &apos;t speak , even if your lashes are in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and invo@@ ke their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in this case , do not think about catching up at the university with a relationship &quot;
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many student residence places form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ bo@@ mel culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship will continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a militant of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; since you start the university on the cli@@ max of the Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked something . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a constant b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; bad mix@@ tures made of flour , sugar and fat will cause people sleeping when you anchor . &quot;
&quot; to steal food , it is a common crime in student resi@@ dences . &quot;
&quot; of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken are stolen , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a balanced deal than my ro@@ omm@@ ate , who added to her milk a pur@@ ge to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make a noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you are among the most tru@@ st@@ worthy people who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours , whether it &apos;s something to give them something , drum &amp; bass , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
she re@@ acted with still loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she sent her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would enter into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it would not be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future marriage partner to take part in them again , and you might have to see them every day and maybe experience how they move all together friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes on its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your under@@ belly a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has its keys in its non @-@ closed room , the border between an Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing is fine than it seems . &quot;

&quot; close your door , and put your keys into a glass of water , which will then put you into the freezer - but you don &apos;t know their pos@@ sessions at the ceiling anymore than twice . &quot;

Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses

&quot; in this way , this interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not look at Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;

&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack them in nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles with new refugees met in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
emergency services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
&quot; in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , Minister of Interior Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were sent to the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , followed by Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade refused to propose certain routes : &quot; neither we nor we want to do this , &quot; it was . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants were the entire night from around 500 kilometres away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border , through Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has been added , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;

&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot;
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed .
&quot; at present , it would not be a very high refugee issue . &quot;

matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Shortage and Overeducation
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian border still not more spacious min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;

&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the rate of interest , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus about what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led to the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently interviewed by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted a net increase of interest this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets anticip@@ ate anticip@@ ation of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strateg@@ ists will alle@@ vi@@ ate the blow by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;

&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if it does , it would have to go far too far to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that interest increase would calm the financial markets , because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary to increase the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;

&quot; although inflation was constantly falling below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets throughout the world came together in the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial Average value fell by more than 16 % below its maximum level , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would increase the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat in this month , with the Dow now around 10 % below the Ho@@ ch of May . &quot;

now he predicted that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liners . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision making process . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years .

&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed with each other , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected that they are not only able to monitor developments in other places but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that seem to not be associated with economic fundament@@ alist data . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ er , approved member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to interest in interest in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its conduc@@ t@@ ance by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , despite limited recogni@@ zable impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts back . &quot;

&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; they certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation where they are afraid of interest in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t believe that it should advance the time . &quot;

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to clarify how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted on breasts , which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of her baby and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;

and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat for solar installation .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ sigh@@ ted gymn@@ asi@@ um building at Bern@@ ri@@ eder &apos;s sports grounds move forward : in the recent meeting of the council , the work carried out without major discussions was unanim@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; previously , the committee had adopted a proposal to build a legal &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tive &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the final construction plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof with non @-@ slip first and roof roof@@ top &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar installations : &quot; this enables us to get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; it was again about the roof pitch that is mandatory for energetic reasons - unlike the development plan - beneath ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan was not allowed to be &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ ad@@ eder &apos;s common council usually means more restri@@ ctive in liber@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; however , at turn@@ around construction , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .

&quot; on the question of who is supposed to follow the succession , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game , which was ready to take over the leadership of October 1 , and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in any case an &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a spreading of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ chner @-@ Weiß . &quot;

the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; according to government figures , the 20,000 migrants were still in the country . &quot;

&quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday with the clearing , as suddenly ten people were standing with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; in Germany on Sunday , however , because of the refugee stream the railway traffic with Austria was surprisingly pres@@ umed , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we had the un@@ trusted guests only once , with a break and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this was of course a matter of course , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train pass@@ ers were converted into a regional train heading towards Pass@@ au , after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try out the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;

&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further thousands of thousands to us , is a logical conclusion of a sacred policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to help the establishment of structures that ensure Human@@ ity , our Federal Chancellor has raised a highly official and public attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions now . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee influ@@ x and the approaching winter , to make decent conditions for protection @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are en@@ co@@ ders .
this property links some even with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; as for the US presidential office , the candidate for the US presidential office hur@@ ts the election campaign . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this will also be registered in the Pal@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ ard come from . &quot;
the New Yorker experiences a term in the wine @-@ road in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf .
&quot; some of the 1,@@ 200 inhabitants of the 1,@@ 200 inhabitants are related to it . &quot;
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his aim of becoming more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think those are somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; the native town of K@@ all@@ stadt has an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ ints , to which Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; - Carl S@@ agan &quot;
&quot; to the king of the hearts , he did not have it there . &quot;
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ ci@@ bly the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is not a matter of course , but it is not a matter of course , but it is not a matter of fact . &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the host .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold gra@@ ves in the USA .
Norton Rose Ful@@ bright Firm of the Year for Pat@@ ents df @-@ mp Dör@@ ries Frank @-@ Mol@@ nia &amp; P@@ ohl@@ mann
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home , failed at the Bavarian State , at which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged . &quot;
&quot; he did not receive Tr@@ ump because he once had been ab@@ duc@@ ted without permission , the director of the Institute for pe@@ an@@ ical history and folk music , Roland Paul , explained to the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this stands in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the desc@@ end@@ ent .
&quot; he was repeatedly accused of Mexican immigrants in the United States , and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; as the pol@@ arized , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born in Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker &apos;s retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine the Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it is better if he doesn &apos;t want the election , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ gen at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;

&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sunrise played an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators in five main cities compared with today 33@@ 9,@@ 000 . &quot;

today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics had asked whether Thom@@ son could wear a hit show Solo without the ra@@ pper Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

&quot; the first half an hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half an hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

&quot; the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident , that hot @-@ seat will prevail in the end at 17 : 30 . &quot;

&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police demonstrated a crowd of people who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , leading district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of you threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot into the air before they return to a rubber spon@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber compounds used , of which are known to kill them , which are traditionally used as less lethal alternatives , obviously produced a so high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ als southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ p@@ i say that new provinces , which would be formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent confron@@ tations since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , has been centr@@ alised for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could act on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; for easy over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who get non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote a guide to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted with people who are obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is obes@@ e , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers used Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study in 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c tu@@ b@@ ular formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments around 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease started completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group &apos; , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood mirror of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but these better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level , does not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results with two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger reg@@ im@@ ents in the BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have accumulated their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not absorb all the refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not adequate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; in order to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of violence and also commented on George B@@ ush@@ s &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he made violence and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , the strong alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant swal@@ lowed , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 are reported to report the poison control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming more and more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or because of a sample of social media . &quot;
video on YouTube shows how teenagers drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be fed by attractive fragran@@ ces of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ ected .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es that are very promising for children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the toxic emergency center at the University of Kansas , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not leave a si@@ ckle whis@@ key , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come , it is a fast way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from after straw@@ berry scent dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold used by an adult by law , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had stum@@ bled over the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ amin &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; beyond alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol that was listed as a drug . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York had to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the class@@ rooms , so there is a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly gra@@ vely allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police considered the same plan as &quot; &quot; stor@@ k &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers middle field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here speak not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Mal@@ m@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ termination of the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , who now face five points at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel that exactly - but we need to go on .
&quot; we really need , really the support of Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot;

&quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , and insisted : &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no capacity to comment . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it increases in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period of May until July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole during the same period around 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; at 5.@@ 9 percent , Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.5 percent , as the numbers of the offices for National Statistics ( ONS ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; some later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison injection . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was for the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came near@@ er , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the USA , and as often more applications are available than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ ate lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites of 12 to five .
who is chosen will be able to watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t allow me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compla@@ ined about her .
&quot; she cleaned up that she could have been able to form@@ ulate it better , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter is present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter for the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that a strong likelihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man to die unnecessary death .
man after firing police brut@@ ality talks to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman kept dry when he was talking to the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police , was un@@ successful when he was in sei@@ zu@@ res and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a peaceful quar@@ ry incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the suspects , they tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ jet@@ c was not too excited about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the race
&quot; Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year , and threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he went on ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that she had a personal campaign against him with the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ test of Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he was kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want to see it as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot;
they know it was going on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to move my head , and I want my owner think that I &apos;m doing my best for her . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more train@@ ers . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before Moody had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable . &quot;
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I am doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ay . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly put themselves on their n@@ oses because they have failed to grasp . &quot;
&quot; Robert Cra@@ w@@ ford , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should I think that it is personally going to be personally ?
has the R@@ V@@ L scrat@@ ched and makes people responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ strations level of the train@@ ers have been set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation into Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching led that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known by his preparation of the un@@ prepared Mei@@ sters Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of mud or tone was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ tors , which was attacked against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I must take over the full responsibility , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has mistakenly applied mud to the leg . &quot;
it would have been like this last night .
&quot; it would have been so , yesterday , what was so . &quot;
but it was also so on the race day .
Moody could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who place these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one is too far , &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy proposes to fight against rivals
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the NR@@ L .
&quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arb@@ iter @-@ player &quot; &quot; ring fights &quot; &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening allowed . &quot;
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a very scar@@ ce note to the Storm Team after his team had achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample example &quot; &quot; of rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not too good . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tor@@ ch of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading train@@ ers on his team was confident , as it was believed that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; this always appears again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when she told us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles to a real focus , and that has been the trend revers@@ ed for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not to lose acc@@ ustom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this is always up to this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne told him that he would take care of a shit . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us than it was about the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs Roo@@ ster scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further tests in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and do not have any points there ?
&quot; for me , it &apos;s the game plans . &quot;
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase . &quot;
the Storm Team will be free on this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts from next Tuesday morning .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone number of girls to attract p@@ ests to the end of pictures
a p@@ est used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
&quot; Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the telephone of the girl , when this fell , log@@ ically received an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the telephone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and aler@@ ted her mother immediately . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analysed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; p@@ est oph@@ ile on the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
&quot; the Prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction to be addic@@ ted to people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was done by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten p@@ est oph@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his talks with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to attract them .
&quot; he said he was ill in the head when he drinks , and said he would then see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and we@@ eping . &quot;
she then looked at the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and faced the def@@ endants .

the mass makes it : every two years the motor@@ bikes show their innovations at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , it is especially important to register a compact car , which is currently being sold especially well . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : around 28,@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals , according to the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) , fell to this segment alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected in the IAA ( Audi@@ ence stage 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new top @-@ class cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented in this year . &quot;
the Opel Astra is one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automotive industry .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair . &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in this way , the volume model is also sold well , the new Astra is not supposed to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the biggest competitors VW Golf in prospect , which starts at 17 : 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs € 16@@ 9@@ 90 .
the Astra has a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hesse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is just as five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the combination , which is also shown at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; and what will take place next to the Astra at the IAA , still on new compact cars ? &quot;
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ rivals Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively regarded as a fifth in a conventional and a sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan dealers will be able to find its position in the strongly growing segment . &quot;
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , among them a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
&quot; according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications , the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what &apos;s going on in Germany ?
&quot; according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated resolution in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create this , and we create this . &quot;
&quot; what comes from Germany , the following overview con@@ veys the following overview . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of housing but above all for affordable rental objects : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social flats are out of rent , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; both assumptions seem unrealistic : for example , the impact of a global shock is likely to vary from one region to another . in this issue on regional labour markets , Norbert Schanne employs novel methods in spatial econometrics to describe and forecast their development . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them at the entrance , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it has given a political turn : from the ban on refugees to recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation for asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .

&quot; so far , there is no adequate offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , studies show that jobs are most frequently medi@@ ated by personal contacts . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the establishment of networks is therefore based on the throne of the Königs@@ weg to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few vol@@ atile parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the parents , it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ en , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; however , in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in various languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more specialist schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared without German knowledge in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully educated teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ays from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German student union estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , there is no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or memory of the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) , but now abandoned its position . &quot;

the students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
the state should succ@@ um@@ b to Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches and the existing state @-@ Chur@@ ches must continue to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
&quot; it is important to also take care of the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who care professional for the newcom@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand , duties include duties . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree to clear contact persons and be willing to work together with the state in many areas and to give him some control options . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the willingness to stand against religious fundament@@ alism is also part of this . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to take such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; immediately their right to stay in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bayer@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in order to change the majority society , the disman@@ tling of discrimination and racism is urgent . &quot;
&quot; as a result of European decisions , Germany has a anti @-@ discrimination function and a general gender equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , how the NSU thriller series showed , in the police and the authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interests of non @-@ white Germans have long been demanding for a long time , and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention must be reality in the next few years , if the country remain peaceful and to use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the expected refugees , the medical @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ acities , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money is needed to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls for all arri@@ vals at the registration of health cards . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the costs of paid items are shown in the procedure , a paid listing has to be confirmed explic@@ itely . &quot;

&quot; already so far , the Berlin Health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be worse than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ters have to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also have helped with more general medical contact centres in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugee children , there is much more un@@ il@@ ateral disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ enlighten@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other illnesses , German doctors have become aware of their training but clearly , Mont@@ gom@@ ery says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , many refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to practice cultivation , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;

&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto , is the latest production stage . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the gift to the present is the family , so the family is in the blood . &quot;

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also said : &quot; &quot; if it is not good to our animals , it &apos;s not good . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , will be read after the possibility of each wish of the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the man@@ ege . &quot;
so the top command@@ ment is : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , is the family Pro@@ bst proud . &quot;
&quot; the two animals have lived together eight years , and nothing is happening . &quot;
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo , &quot; said Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it &apos;s the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; for each visitor , there should be something to do with this . &quot;
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with all the heart . &quot;
&quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst , from 17 to 20 September , invites to his performances daily from 17 to 20 September . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 am and 4@@ pm . &quot;

&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job cuts lead to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will conduct the unity after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is becoming smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion of annual revenue and will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says a company &apos;s statement . &quot;
it is divided into a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electro @-@ systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .

&quot; FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Kapitän Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and if his rehabilitation after plan runs , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his story , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then returned to his old swing during the season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of breach threat@@ ens not the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it &apos;s a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
that is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his ank@@ le , or with the injuries he had previously . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical perspective , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ spiele in the last five times .
&quot; the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 , which have suffered most injuries . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in injury rate will continue during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain combat force , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope to stabili@@ ze his body , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team . &quot;
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to break a small break break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o has also been un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake in the evening by an earthquake , measured on the Richter scale 3.2 . &quot;
&quot; this year , it was the 10th in Zagreb . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains from the far @-@ reaching hope to lead the association to its first European ap@@ oc@@ al@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked with Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dream@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Comedy @-@ Show which gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now even more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year court . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - Campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help , if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressive symptoms noted that if the suffering had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ve the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication conducted through social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the response is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality the isolation predomin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at costs in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health a lot more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money cannot really buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality that sh@@ ook the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football , and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men can relate to it , even though they are often reluct@@ ant to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of the telephone psy@@ che told me : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ confident , really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel not able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone can also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day totally re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you &apos;re sitting around in Starbucks alone , give him a smile and tell you Hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .

di Maria meets PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Mal@@ m@@ ö
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass over Mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ mond Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ Park Stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French Masters to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead , as Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ b@@ aker in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish master , as they are not only aiming for the qualifying for the K.@@ A. rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or forth in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and to look back , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected over the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic was able to hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bor@@ deaux in the first league , but he was exposed to Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing door was called the man to take the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he suggested why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the mal@@ m@@ ö defense before he concluded to Johan Wil@@ and , passing nicely into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , which struck the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , came to An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4. minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes encountered some mis@@ ses and bad agreements , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ start . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell shortly after the hour stamp , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth season tor after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had captured a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from no distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before the waiting list Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced later that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norweg@@ ians said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which didn &apos;t have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not sufficient .
hat off in front of Paris !

&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night by H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need of alternative perspectives , and in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport climbing and operator assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; the competition show , which has just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to finish all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Kamer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing an 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock above the win of the Grand Prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved more than 10,000 dollars or had a life , &quot; &quot; Isaac said ! about his pile of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price , and life changes , it receives the great engraving . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he is upset about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
the masses of awards were received by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers passing on Minnesota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; earlier , they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
the Tw@@ ins lost a chance for as@@ cen@@ sion within a side of the Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Fal@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit was punc@@ tured three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then even in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside and made three races .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to concentrate fully in the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has s@@ wollen the wood well , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked well out of his ( punch training ) , looked much better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight to the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back to the game again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to the stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ worked the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was this season in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play
&quot; after Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , Wall fell a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don , and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed st@@ ach however , however , looks at three Pit@@ ches for its fifth time . &quot;
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two cases against the right @-@ handed veter@@ ans , who had been painted before the game from the injury list after he was missing more than one month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ner in the scoring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third that ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; in the second , the Tig@@ ers achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said Tw@@ ins Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; he was not particularly well beaten , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there came to three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury of the litter .
&quot; he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder lock , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz

&quot; in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , on Wednesday a well @-@ known square in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was bapti@@ sed on the name of the German Re@@ formers . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the park lies in the middle of the old Rome , right next to the Kol@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot;
the name was applied by the Evangel@@ ical Chur@@ ches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith in the city of the pop@@ es over centuries . &quot;

hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with magnificent pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the image of Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his very personal interpretations of Bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with multic@@ ol@@ oured colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equal with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : the respective themes are adapted , this can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic choice from the many subjects of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles related to the topics such as cross paths , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or fa@@ ther@@ ings . &quot;
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Hogan Lov@@ ells
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is on the basis of painting with the respective Bible positions . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus transl@@ ates into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ ally mirror of Al@@ lies painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original biography of Martin Luther and a pro@@ position of the artist , who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts about the situation here . &quot;
the jewelry clas@@ p has golden Let@@ tern .
&quot; this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; in the end , emotions were ultimately trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order . &quot;
&quot; since the up@@ bringing happened already with the tube , Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work this , perhaps to forgive me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to revi@@ ve the art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is characterised by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers go into the pictures , discovering and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for itself . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ lies art : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t care to grasp the Bible completely , but also selected for him important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( Bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .

&quot; it was the first time that we were able to take a closer look at what was going on in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a good idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so hill scre@@ ened , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will take place in October , the First Joint Meeting of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock explains now in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;

&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancellor &apos;s Office and meet the Secretary of State Ms. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; there will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and wants to help .

some federal lists support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals set a clear sign when they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ är@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) to help the imprint &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can only , &quot; said Leverk@@ usen , sport@@ sman Rudi Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every time , nobody is allowed to take away . &quot;
&quot; we have to use football federal lists , no , we have to use our radiation power , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have been so incredibly successful to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;

&quot; the report provides detailed information on Mergers and Acquisitions , Equity / Debt Off@@ erings , Private Equity , Venture Financing and Partnership transactions recorded by the company over a five year period . &quot;
&quot; for the testing of new technology , a test track is currently underway on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order to make the driver &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework , and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to make an international effort to ensure that the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised by 10 to 130 km / km . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government intends to apply for an amend@@ ment to the Vienna Convention that has so far only seen the people as a driver . &quot;

&quot; the Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services . it employs roughly 36@@ 0,000 associates worldwide ( as per April 1 , 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on high@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far from 2020 . &quot;

&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he had been on the other hand , for : &quot; for me an exhibition was a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Canadian Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;

our products are hardly able to reach the customer on this path .
&quot; the mass ware , nowadays , is much cheaper in the Asian space and distributed almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the weak@@ ening of export , currently in Russia and the USA . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the ST@@ ICK@@ PER@@ LE in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; Professor U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the &quot; &quot; Schne@@ eber@@ ger &quot; &quot; of the West Saxon University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty of applied arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that needs time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly variable in order to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter is new to the historic snow@@ ball tip . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine is sti@@ cking at some places small chi@@ ckens . &quot;
&quot; the plau@@ sible gold@@ smith master@@ in Bi@@ anca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Krau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; before , I could not start with traditional plau@@ sible lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .

EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consumers , thus making a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed with full force on pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish should be raised at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are so heavily bur@@ dened with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the still applicable limit values are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the marginal values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ disgu@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU according to Food@@ Watch wants to ti@@ ghten the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; however , food@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ ps are usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; this is why &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that will help the economy alone &quot; , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a highly toxic heavy metal that is strongly enrich@@ ing over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the federal government therefore warns that &quot; low quantities of the nervous system can cause serious damage to the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury enters the environment especially by coal combustion .
&quot; according to a written statement by the Federal Environment Ministry on the Green Party Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount invested in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and comprehensive &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings from mer@@ cury in fish were already reported to the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RAS@@ FF . &quot;
