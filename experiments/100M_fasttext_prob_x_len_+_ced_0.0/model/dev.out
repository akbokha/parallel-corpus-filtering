Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendship .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ abili@@ sing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , the conflict with Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal of the deal with the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu at invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not ab@@ duc@@ ted with Obama , a meeting with regard to the election of the upcoming election in Israel was rejected . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor conf@@ esses to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lam@@ b was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; in the house , the officers found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted it to be revers@@ ed , I loved Amy and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who lived in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , has already traveled 300 miles to the school site , where he had shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Political Writer Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lam@@ b made the fatal emergency call at some point afterwards .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cled him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what lam@@ bs were motivated . &quot;
&quot; the editors at both ends of the state published details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy with his teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal background . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History , which includes 17 members , and many students visited both of them . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to be problematic . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised the Lam@@ b , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something is wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lam@@ b had asked the Delta State University for an assessment of health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the promotion , for which Lam@@ b had worked so hard , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as a Assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lam@@ b cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police found a trace when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car still ran in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; Lam@@ b started his work at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and taught geography and education . &quot;
he earned a doctor@@ ate in education in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 when she met together with friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool elder guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar . &quot;
he was at the time of the flock of women .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; Hair@@ ston said , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously a couple of times together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lam@@ b said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lam@@ b , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;

later they played one or another gig together .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment Co@@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lam@@ b finished his guitar and oral harmon@@ ica . &quot;
there were no signs that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his brother and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lect@@ urers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the &quot; &quot; M@@ ahn@@ awake Star &quot; &quot; and sang &quot; &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the lessons will resume on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; Amy and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press writers Emily Car@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect , that the police now say that Lam@@ b made emergency call after he had shot Schmidt and that Lam@@ b referred to Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two ever married . &quot;

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief urges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the General Assembly , to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ tt@@ ed that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the &quot; &quot; regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation impossible . &quot;
ban called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .

some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys down , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national poll@@ s showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination for Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership has been handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain in 2011 , no one has won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but external groups like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ umps stam@@ ina and start to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current changes that indicate that Real Estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps Any@@ where values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . &quot;
now six of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in the early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week noted that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in a survey by CNN &apos;s last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of ten say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the next thing about enthusiasm ?

&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republican voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters think that the real estate Mog@@ ul has the right tem@@ per for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week , the same number is valid in the first election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively manage his office , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; if they put their money back , republi@@ can voters den@@ ounce Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; when they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee , they say after a survey by CNN / ORC of last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination over just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump beats almost everyone . &quot;
some experts suggest that the sh@@ attered field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps leadership while anti @-@ dr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Williams den@@ ies the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and eventually Rand Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who is propos@@ ing him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head race .

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is the strongest competitor in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for dr@@ ump . &quot;
six of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; was the immigration turning and fishing point in the public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tr@@ ump will hold crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans from the Republican Party and will damage the new orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post @-@ survey from Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; as long as immigration is left in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently will do too . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
&quot; according to Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago demonstrates that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ strated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ naire
&quot; since its election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ naire will be expected with tension &quot;
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ naire and set up with David Cameron for the first time .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise in order to put the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from the vicinity . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 75@@ th anniversary of the battle of Britain in silence , was prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several titles stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he accepted the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are calling on differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; political correspondent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences will also be st@@ acked within Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour was making changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to cut the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory leader , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ nai@@ res are too controversial , and that he has both &quot; &quot; pot@@ ency &quot; &quot; and stri@@ ving to tackle serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister will be represented if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on the move abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesman of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ naire . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast in 1990 on television , the question@@ naire with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of the judgment of a driver and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserve more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the arbit@@ rators , and Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp@@ f had a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ age is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth at the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I really en@@ vy myself is the fact that after my View Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the fight , He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he broke a bat when he lost a var@@ ic@@ ose in US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has been extremely well beha@@ ved in the US Open , even under the rather provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around , and I think he was treated somewhat too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with other players , he is well in shape , he is a very sturdy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os on the important decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to concentrate fully on the competition and not all of the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I think it is best for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;

the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .

elections in Israel : Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s victory over the Labor Party coalition
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race around nom@@ ination at a national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over to the ground . &quot;

&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eling for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elect@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more permanent in their election than those of the other candidates .

&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and s@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; but Clinton , however , has a great advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton presented a two @-@ digit lead in Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic elect@@ ors of the presidential election say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .

Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval for dealing with problems and constitu@@ tionally refer@@ r@@ als are also cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president holds a potential for the presidential office in the Wa@@ ag Cup , 57 percent of the democratic elect@@ ors want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elect@@ ors are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
more than half of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den does not decide to channel the Democrats &apos; nom@@ ination , Hillary Clinton &apos;s head raised before S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic elect@@ orate sees Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has declined by 78 percent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic elect@@ ors call for ques@@ tioning . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for elect@@ ing these candidates is unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results with some important features in choosing the elections of their party .
&quot; we consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is best suited for the three candidates best , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; democratic elect@@ ors of the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters did not think of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Minister of Foreign Affairs , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say they have not influenced their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on the general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was even worse . &quot;

five members of Brotherhood charged with death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder charges were filed against five people . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 , and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field on a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the call number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gling his symptoms and to get Andy Men@@ g to contact the national President of Brotherhood , said Poli@@ z@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the uten@@ sils to hide and set the benefit of Brotherhood basically about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy , Den@@ g repeated with mu@@ te force injuries on head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; at least one student died every year at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury from Mon@@ roe recommended charges for murder of the third grade for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of violent attacks and formation of a criminal organization . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has been officially or officially - this is sanc@@ tioned , &quot; &quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;

&quot; a rise in interest comes , and the se will fall into fluctu@@ ations , returns to bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate rise and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising the interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in the way the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore representatives of the US Central Bank stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on increasing interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;

&quot; the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , interest increases can make things vol@@ atile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase is reached , the influence is not as dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that net asset yields rise from 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is going on according to interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the er@@ ection cycle and the yield starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often encourage them .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that had not been before and that could accelerate the recession . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest rates in a so fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made up the whole year on an increase of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week ending on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the production cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing heights are posed very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;

the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle takes place . &quot;

the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fall in the curve .

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earnings curve is fl@@ atter , lending , and vol@@ atility has increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed shar@@ pens their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and the whole , companies that wrap the larger part of their business in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debt will be worse than a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debt .

Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group to the burden
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane approached Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandmother .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went on to the Holy Site , where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the veil of the mos@@ que and then collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for funeral , when the Saudi King handed over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
the bodies of 29 soldiers who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mo@@ j@@ es@@ ee Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the annual pad@@ dle in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the hadi@@ th is going to Mec@@ ca with thousands , which will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , could not stand the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported that this detail was not reported , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is forbidden abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the sick , which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand mo@@ ch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the h@@ add@@ ling , which took place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden group did not release any statements about the collapse of the sick , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ ad@@ ored the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mo@@ und as part of the massive building project managed by Bin Laden Group .
&quot; for decades , the Bin Laden family has been linked to the Saudi Arabia &apos;s sovereign family and takes over major construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dec@@ ei@@ ving son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated from the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the collapse of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .

&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue to lead the club or lock up ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants told the def@@ endant in the bread@@ maker of the financial year . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take over this task . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US bank is coming to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade , interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists sur@@ vey@@ ed by Reuters found that a little more than half , the last week of view that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large Central Bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good performance , tri@@ lli@@ ons dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw outlook on global relations . &quot;

&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lam@@ b gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lam@@ b , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;

&quot; after writing the note , Lam@@ b drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; in spite of reports on Monday , the Lam@@ b believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; triangle relationship &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ ction of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left outside def@@ enders to we@@ ep and won him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg structure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then is fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;

you can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .

&quot; if a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot;
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball coming in another direction so that it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;

&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost . &quot;
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax decided to visit Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , he writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , re@@ signs an abstra@@ ction of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel lived and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; a young man named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; even though he is to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is not familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read the Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row of a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was likely to come from Cameron &apos;s election bure@@ au .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there was no immediate comment . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the ban from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test planes is an option for the attack . &quot;
this message : Adam Ly@@ th goes out of England &apos;s test ca@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that the cri@@ cket players are gear@@ ed towards results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , it would have been prolonged by Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hope to turn out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t produce such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is especially a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test strike receives to set its mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very well . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team &apos;s position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to bring Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would bring an extra spin bow@@ ler and get four qui@@ cks , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; - Carl S@@ agan &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
&quot; he has made three hundred ri@@ fts away , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see its statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inn@@ akers that raise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen themselves for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind to the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously spoken . &quot;
&quot; my team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One Day@@ ers , R@@ oot won a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players the jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .

France &apos;s François Hollande is looking back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon be a nationalist right government , Spain one left . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ fie Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately plan un@@ helpful notes , in the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend suspects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a P@@ lei@@ te , &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name as a &quot; &quot; EU Ger@@ ade Ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 90 @-@ s years . &quot;
ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sho@@ cks , phone hack@@ ers and pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als who have most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Tony Blair thought about it , but determined that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa sitting in a cage , better ban@@ anas are distributed to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir@@ ans than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Blair had put the principle on the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which was then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;

it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cabinet colleague without going too far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , or what J@@ C told his fellow comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe , allowing him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;

&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ity on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege @-@ Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;

Marktanalyse - Personal Accident and Health Insurance Claims and Exp@@ enses in United Kingdom to 2018 : market Databook
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health Britain ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
PH@@ E published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis &quot; based on PH@@ E its most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expects the claim of PH@@ E that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking , &quot; based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling . &quot;
the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .

&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed to get funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding that he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the Board are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champions , some of whom also provide sector financing in the paper . &quot;

&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are low , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs two billion euros a year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;

&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for placing public @-@ law programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place a hard controversial time window against the most popular shows of their rivals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years at Channel 4 without success to contact the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; Johnson said to the upper @-@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I think medium or long @-@ term don &apos;t think for a good idea , you should at least put its production on programs that others do not make or put into commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed programs that could also be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I &apos;m tired of seeing how this is to be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for ratings &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; Johnson said the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfil their tasks and they can argue if they are prepared for their apparent missions for justification of 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
&quot; they put them in a time window , where no one ever wanted to see them . &quot;
Johnson said the committee said : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this .
&quot; of course , all of us think we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that is true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission &quot; &quot; to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should be informed , clarify and enter@@ tain to the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with commercial broad@@ ens to make alli@@ ances available online . &quot;

HZ@@ I researchers discover control centres in Y@@ ers@@ inia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature
the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction at the moment when they have sound impul@@ ses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
impul@@ ses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound may be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that det@@ ects electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
&quot; sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically altered the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ eph@@ ones TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when ultrasound applied to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transfer them into the worms , where they turn off the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that has to be sent to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible the recru@@ ited human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ic company advertisement , but &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Amnesty . &quot;
what we need now is a stepping up of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices cannot be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally from our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for life in student residence
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I had anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
enter multiple addresses separated by commas and / or different lines .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to slip : people tell where you come from where you come from where you are getting to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly told Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it diver@@ ges the conversation and helps you to find out people who like you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night event locations and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and reck@@ on their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : don &apos;t think about catching up at the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student dor@@ ms form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead .
speaking of speaking : do it .
a guy in my student dor@@ ms had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship with che@@ eks .
&quot; as you start the university at the peak of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome from the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to bake . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
&quot; bad mix of flour , sugar and fat will cause people to face sleeping when you tap . &quot;
to steal food is a common crime in student housing .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ amping of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with balanced handling as my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added to her milk a dish@@ washing agent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make a noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours if there was something to do with them , drum &amp; bass , because there were three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly allowed their neighbors to sleep two hours before they threw their own music , shut down their door and went to their three @-@ hour test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would fall into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be ground@@ less embarrass@@ ing if you have a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future marriage partner to go to her , dis@@ connect herself and see them every day , and maybe experience how they cover all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future marriage partner , at least try to persu@@ ade your under@@ coat a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good sting is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; share a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security through hiding , but never mind anyone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door , and put your keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but tack@@ y your pos@@ sessions to the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;

&quot; one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ ans , followed the police with two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
&quot; on the premises of the gas station , there were also three persons . &quot;
&quot; one of these men now cried to the young people , and struck him with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al break and bleeding strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and compla@@ ined about the ra@@ ckets , he first left off from his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home . &quot;
the perpet@@ rator then followed the group with a passenger car to their home and drove past several times .
&quot; when one couldn &apos;t see the vehicle , the injured were in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was once again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .

&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strateg@@ ists will alle@@ vi@@ ate the blow by promising a further boost . &quot;

&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would withdraw the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a rise in interest would re@@ assure the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that it would be necessary in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid in this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level , which the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly shifting under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world sent out the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average Import@@ ance fell by over 16 % in May , as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would increase global growth . &quot;

now he tells you that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said . &quot;

&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation Spr@@ S tries to clarify women about how important good nutrition during bre@@ ast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted with pictures of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation to carry out the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours . &quot;

&quot; in this way , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was necessary because the construction plan of the roof pitch is not permitted . &quot;

&quot; instead of the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the construction of structures that ensure Human@@ ity , our Chancellor has officially opened up the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st circle of Naz@@ ism . &quot;
this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced with cha@@ otic conditions now in the border areas .
&quot; the refugees will also find that the &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing floo@@ ds of refugees and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for seeking asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;

&quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods Last Rose ? &quot; , &quot; their answers may become a game sp@@ ouse who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;

&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers sports reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special Team Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his p@@ inn@@ y catch and take care of the next game .

&quot; for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who get non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a editorial to the new study in AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have been proven to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been conducted with people who are sick and obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers used Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c tu@@ b@@ ular formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes is completely dissolved and at 28 % partially . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , thus the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compens@@ ates for average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ tom@@ y Group ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) , and marked a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit in the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of severely disabled people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went an O@@ bes@@ ity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was reas@@ sured for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , their body with obesity and diabetes is really hard to reverse . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the problem of violence , and also commented George B@@ ush@@ s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and set out that the violent reaction of the US moved into a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;

&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low strong alcoholic dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of income of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years reported to report the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children come more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
video on YouTube shows how teenagers drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents have supposedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be picked up by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es , which are very promising for children . &quot;
hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Kansas City Hospital , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand san@@ iti@@ zer in reach of children , and when children get it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sy@@ ring@@ es from after straw@@ berry laying dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in the school , was taken into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey said , an emergency doctor , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; in a separate children &apos;s hospital , doctors monitored them in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by alcohol and had stum@@ bled across the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CNN . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand san@@ iti@@ zer outside of the child &apos;s reach .
some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths due to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as a substance . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in New York were planning to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , so there is a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic against hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police acted as a &quot; &quot; stor@@ k &quot; &quot; plan , and instruc@@ ted disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot;

&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Firm .

&quot; I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;

why I am a witness of an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;

he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;

I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t allow me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just need to try to remember all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I have compla@@ ined about her .
&quot; they pointed out that &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulated , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ard , a reporter for the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that a strong likelihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters that you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to die a man an unnecessary death .

&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been eating a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out once again , &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well tonight .

&quot; before that Moody had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stall . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly put themselves to their n@@ oses because they have failed to grasp me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Schultz , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ s , Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ dier , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should I believe that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L hold down co@@ war@@ dly and perhaps do people outside train@@ ers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I &apos;m it .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I arrived at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League Favor@@ ites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said the refer@@ ee the Storm player &quot; Ring@@ eld &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a very hard note to the Storm Team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample example &quot; &quot; of rug@@ by league and said that the two Que@@ ens@@ land won &apos;t be &quot; too good &quot; in rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tor@@ ch of his team , and said that they were only concent@@ rating on their &quot; contact &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers at his team is confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; this happens repeatedly - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ eld when she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing on our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and this has provided us the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has to train a great team . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this time this time is coming up again .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said he would take care of a shit . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters was a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos vs cow@@ boys . &quot;
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more experiments in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are p@@ auses and no points something exciting ?
&quot; for me , it &apos;s the sched@@ ules . &quot;

&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : approximately 28,@@ 1 percent of new vehicles accounted for this segment alone in August alone . &quot;
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 @-@ 27 ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new top @-@ class and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is Opel Astra , which will be held at the dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf in prospect , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost around 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra has a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hesse offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which the first three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are among the first . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .

&quot; in this respect , scientists and Federal Minister of the Federal Ministry say that there has to be more tax advantages for investments in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; both assumptions seem unrealistic : for example , the impact of a global shock is likely to vary from one region to another . in this issue on regional labour markets , Norbert Schanne employs novel methods in spatial econometrics to describe and forecast their development . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find a job in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Reu@@ ben@@ hardt . &quot;

&quot; so far , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;

&quot; therefore , the building of networks is therefore based on the throne of the Königs@@ weg to work integration . &quot;

&quot; in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration will distribute hand@@ books in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators greatly increase by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for instance by allowing more specialised schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without German knowledge will be prepared for teaching . &quot;
&quot; they are not always taught by fully educated teachers , but as in Berlin , as well as teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ables from the Berlin School administration . &quot;

s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the statements made by members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with be@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had bu@@ ked him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokesperson for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they warned before to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that does not appear , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in the Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief spokesman said that the party held by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers of politicians .

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; he stressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his story his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is uncertain . &quot;
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .

it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his ank@@ le , or with the injuries he had previously . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since its debut six years ago .
&quot; he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 157 league games , in the last five times . &quot;
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a prone period of time , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb against the games against Chelsea on Saturday and at Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger re@@ alizes a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need to break a little break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ date in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
&quot; on Tuesday evening the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake , measured on the Richter scale 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains committed by far @-@ reaching hope to lead the association to its first European ap@@ oc@@ al@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked out in Arsen@@ al .

Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now even more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high court . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the issue , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressive symptoms determined that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances for recovery have doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication conducted by social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even though in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at costs in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty with friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football , in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can relate to it , even though they are often restra@@ ined to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff member of the telephone trial , I explained to me : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and su@@ ici@@ dal , really clearly showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; as very my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone man may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day a completely re@@ designed setting , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .

di Maria meets PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Mal@@ m@@ ö
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , helping PS@@ G to pass on Mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ mond Cav@@ ani stopped course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Mal@@ m@@ ö at Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French Masters to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball@@ ast in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O. laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class@@ game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and to look back , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ecting during the season , &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t achieved one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury , which could hold a 2 : 2 oun@@ ces on his own place against Bor@@ deaux in the first league , but he was exposed in the fourth minute through Di Maria . &quot;
the Argent@@ inian wing stor@@ mer was called the man who took PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United in the last month .
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , who suggested Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined the field with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed away from Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4. minute , they offered little to the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ concep@@ tions and bad connections , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved far more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole . &quot;
the second goal was finally shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er scored his sixth season goal after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flank of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an outstanding intervention from Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before the waiting list Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish League who did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Matter movement achieved nationwide action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against farmers . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince played a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leader of the Black Li@@ ves Matter movement published an explanation , and in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Matter network is a love group , &quot; the leaders said . &quot;
&quot; recently , Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crown first champion
professional sport climbing and assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete who took the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; the competition show , which closed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last job , climbing was part of a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete who finished the stren@@ uous Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the fierce victory , still under the shock of the win of the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had a life , &quot; Isaac E. said , over his pile of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. like I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , money goes to the quick@@ est person . &quot;
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it gets the great gra@@ tification . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
crowds of awards were received by fans .
he is such a great guy and a father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aking past Minnesota Tw@@ ins past
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ Second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the final place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
the Tw@@ ins w@@ asted a chance to climb up within one half of Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ Word , which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , as Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then even ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings 6 times and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to quit this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to concentrate fully into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ bis since mid August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he liked the impact wood well , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( percussion training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight to the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon took his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , designed by Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen on the right @-@ hand Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run , Ver@@ hagen led the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;

&quot; after Detroit was added to a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , Wall created an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed stand , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ ans , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he was missing more than one month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , there was a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runner in the scoring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t hit it very well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in third inning before it was replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter reli@@ ever . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there came to three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
remarks : Tiger &apos;s R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury of the throwing school .
&quot; he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z Sh@@ oul@@ der in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder injury , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;

no diet @-@ fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
&quot; but who wants to pay attention to his sl@@ ender line , it is often more likely to come from them . &quot;
&quot; because man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar , especially su@@ cro@@ se . &quot;
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits still : B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ go contains much vitamin A and its pre@@ stage beta car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruit supports visual power , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
&quot; the shell colour alone does nothing about how ripe the fruit is , so green man@@ gos can taste very tasty . &quot;
you should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; however , a man@@ go is also a special note . &quot;
it so@@ oth@@ es the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ea and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless square in the park was bapti@@ sed on the Opp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the park lies in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot;
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith in the city of Pop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; with the place , in a symbolic way , it becomes visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; he received the city at that time as a desc@@ endant of a scap@@ ego@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his negative impressions may be encouraged by historians in his later battle against Rome .
Luther was then initiated with his thes@@ es against the aband@@ on@@ ment of the Western Church .
hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture was form@@ ulated for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his personal interpretation of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , the respective themes are adapted , this can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective and artistic choice from the many them@@ atic areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross @-@ path , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments , or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Hogan Lov@@ ells
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective bi@@ ble points . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the bi@@ ble points selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original bi@@ blical quot@@ ation of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who is form@@ ulated here his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry clas@@ p has golden letters .
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ unters Order . &quot;
&quot; here the up@@ bringing happened with the cane , &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I tried to stop working in order to be able to forgive me again with the Lord &apos;s Father .
&quot; his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always some secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall into the pictures &quot; , &quot; to let them appear , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; old did not pay attention to the Bible completely , but also selected for him important , also mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explained only . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( Bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .

just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : display mannequins , which are terri@@ fying human thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who was among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts . &quot;
I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was easy , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; G@@ aul@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the designer has changed his attitude to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; For me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been in Canada in Canada and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man , written in fashion history without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk for which much effort was carried out : to eat the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example . &quot;
&quot; 14 tons of material have lost the maker , according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , to Munich . &quot;

also G@@ aul@@ ting old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , grac@@ eful fashion design of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy BH@@ s and dresses , G@@ aul@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught how to disc@@ ard fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like G@@ aul@@ tier in Munich .

jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Plau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Plau@@ en to make metres . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large amounts for customers , which they worked for example to blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ ehr@@ it@@ ze Plau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning times of the Plau@@ ener Spitze , fashion became a major part , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;

our products reach customers in this way .
&quot; today , mass products are produced much cheaper in Asia and almost exclusively distributed over chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weaker , current to Russia and the US . &quot;
there are plenty of reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association also seeks to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the ST@@ ICK@@ PER@@ LE in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality label that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; diplom@@ a designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Austrian University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty of applied art , speci@@ alising in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly variable in order to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ invented the historic snow ball lace . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine gets small kitchens at some places . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Plau@@ ener Gold@@ smith &quot; &quot; in Bi@@ anca Hal@@ leb@@ ach Krau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; before I could not start with traditional Plau@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot;
now she uses the lace top for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plau@@ en and surroundings , who would like to have a reminder . &quot;
&quot; in this way , I see my jewellery as a modern mess@@ enger of the Plau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;

&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the ri@@ ghtful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and deliver better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
