&quot; a ) For the effective implementation of securing measures in accordance with this Convention , the organization of the Organisation in accordance with this Convention is granted information on core material , which is subject to securing measures , and on the characteristics of the equipment used to carry out the safety measures relating to this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) i ) The organization requires only the minimum level of information and data which is compatible with the implementation of their duties following this agreement .
&quot; ( II ) information on equipment is limited to the minimum level , which is necessary for the use of securing measures in relation to core material , which is subject to securing measures following this agreement . &quot;
&quot; C ) In the search of the community , the organization is ready to consider investment data that the community considers to be particularly vulnerable to the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; this data does not need to be materi@@ ally transmitted to the organization , as long as they remain open to the organization in the premises of the community without further access . &quot;
a ) i ) The organisation takes the consent of the community and states to the designation of insp@@ ectors for the states .
&quot; II ) aboli@@ shes the fel@@ lowship either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at any time opposed to a designation , thus the organization of the community and the states suggests one or more alternative types . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the repeated refusal of the community , to appro@@ ve the appointment of insp@@ ectors of the organization , the Council is entitled to discuss the refusal by the General Director of the Organization - in the following as &quot; &quot; General Director &quot; &quot; - with the aim of meeting suitable measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The community and the affected states undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the insp@@ ectors of the organization can actually be entru@@ sted to them according to their agreement , in fact . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the insp@@ ectors of the organization are set up so that i ) the potential har@@ ass@@ ment and disorder for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other insp@@ ectors of the organization for knowledge of confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each state is opposed to the organization , including their assets , funds and assets , as well as their insp@@ ectors and other officials , the responsibilities of the agreement on the rights and liber@@ ties of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this agreement shall be termin@@ ated in relation to core material , if the community and organisation determine that the material has been used or dil@@ uted in a way that it is not usable for a nuclear activity that is under the point of view of the security measures of Bel@@ ang , which is not more usable or practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the community noti@@ fies the organisation according to the Convention on the provision of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to securing measures following this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this agreement will be termin@@ ated in relation to core material as soon as the recipient state , as stated in this Convention , has taken over responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organisation conduc@@ ts documents from which any transfer , and if necessary , the re @-@ application of securing measures to the further core material . &quot;
&quot; core material that is subject to securing measures after this Convention is to be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or pot@@ tery , so agreed the community with the organisation of such a kind of use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be concluded in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material during the duration of non @-@ application of securing measures after this Convention is not used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bodies .
B ) The organisation and community make a provision that the securing measures will only be used for such a long time as the core material is used in such activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation is determined as far as possible , as long and under which circumstances these safegu@@ ards are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures will be re @-@ applied in this Convention as soon as the core material is brought back to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held over the total quantity and the composition of this material in the state or the country concerned , and over any passing of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains their agreement as swi@@ ft@@ ly as possible ; it covers only matters such as temporary and process @-@ related provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not exclu@@ de any endor@@ sement or protection of the military activity and does not apply to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs associated with each of them in the implementation of their respective obligations . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary costs due to a particular er@@ ection of the organization , the organisation will rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se these costs , as long as they have been en@@ rolled in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation contributes to the cost of all additional measurements and sample frames required by the organization &apos;s insp@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states ensure that liability protection for nuclear damage , including an insurance or other financial security , can be applied to the organisation and its officials for the purposes of implementing this Convention in the same manner as on the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with international law , any claim that the fel@@ lowship or state of the organisation or the organisation against the organisation or the organization against the organization or the state may be caused by any damage from a nuclear incident that has emerged from the implementation of the securing measures after this agreement shall be regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; according to the general director , the Council is determined to ensure that no nuclear material , which has to be subject to securing measures , may be subject to the provisions intended for nuclear weapons or other nuclear bodies , and , if necessary , take place in the article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ ute , and if necessary , take appropriate measures taken there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council should take into account the measures taken by the measures used by the safety measures , and the community or the state - as far as any of the two parties concerned is affected - any reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary safety . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state , consult@@ ations are held on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states are entitled to seek , therefore , that questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes , according to Article 19 or one of the Council &apos;s decisions , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not in the negotiation process or by another of the organisation , the community and the States shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tribun@@ al , which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states name two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four so named arbit@@ rators elect a fifth one . &quot;
&quot; if the community and the States or the organisation have not named two arbit@@ rators within three @-@ three days after the application , the community or organisation can seek the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is applied if within three days after the nom@@ ination or appointment of the fourth arbit@@ rator , the fifth arbit@@ rators were not elected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the Arb@@ it@@ ration Court are compla@@ ining , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Arb@@ it@@ ration Court are binding for the organization , community and the affected states . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention does not apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contrac@@ ting party of the contract and the members of the community , in force , i ) if the concerned state of the organization is noti@@ fied that its procedures for the force of this Convention are concluded . &quot;
&quot; ( II ) If the Community of the Organisation noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the parties concerned about a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The general director teaches all Member States of the organisation by any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
&quot; a ) This agreement occurs on the day in force , in which the organization of the community and the States maintains the written notification , that their procedures are completed for the force of force . &quot;
B ) This agreement will remain in force as long as the states of the contract are contrac@@ ting .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to establish the procedure as necessary in implementing the provisions of the part I on securing measures .
&quot; the aim of the safety measures defined in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bodies for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent from such a branch through the risk of early discovery . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the insp@@ ections by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which the material quantity is not specified for a specific period of time , stating the accuracy limits for the specified seas . &quot;
&quot; during the execution of their examinations , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the safegu@@ arding system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind of use and , as far as necessary , see how to be closer to the suppl@@ ementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of obtained , produced , dispatch , lost or in other ways from the continu@@ ance removed core material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) evaluate re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement and assessment of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures for assessment of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes of this inventory , including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
&quot; g ) precau@@ tions , which ensure the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ; &quot;
h ) Proc@@ edure to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
&quot; the securing measures after this agreement are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to material in mining , or in the ore processing industry . &quot;
&quot; B ) is called ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet been achieved under the letter c ) , which is introduced under the letter c ) , shares the amount and composition of the material , unless it is not established for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves the core material , which is based on the composition and purity of the fuel production or the process phase in which it is produced , or , in a later phase of the nuclear power cycle produced in the states , it is subject to the other in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The safety measures proposed in this Convention are finished under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the conditions mentioned in Article 11 are not authorised or desired , the organisation and the community consult each other over the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures proposed in this Convention are termin@@ ated under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , if the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures following this agreement : &quot;
a ) special cle@@ av@@ age material when used in grams - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such a core material is ref@@ und@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with an is@@ ot@@ opic level of pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures after this agreement , of these safegu@@ ards , unless the whole , due to this article in the states , is no longer than any more than &quot;
&quot; a ) a total of a kil@@ ogra@@ m of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; ( II ) Uran@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) U@@ ran with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature ur@@ an , is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ ton@@ ed square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and aged ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of aged U@@ ran with a enrich@@ ment of 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; the core material is intended to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to securing measures according to the Convention , processed or stored , so precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ application of securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the fel@@ lowship meets with the organization suppl@@ ementary agreements , which are required for the successful and effective execution of the tasks of the organization in accordance with this agreement , in the individual , as the procedure defined in the Convention . &quot;
the suppl@@ ementary agreements can be extended or changed without changing this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the suppl@@ ementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to force these agreements within nin@@ ety days following the force of force of this Convention ; an extension of this deadline requires the agreement between the organization , community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report , the organization is set up a composite inventory of the entire , the securing measures of the underlying core material in the states , regardless of its origin , and results in the following reports and the results of their follow @-@ up examinations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and their Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme on the conference on international economic cooperation , to help the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by universal res@@ sources of resources . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the goal of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution is bound by the member states within six months , and as far as possible within two years after force enters into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have cons@@ ented to each other via the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central links to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organization of the E@@ EC has submitted a table to which it is intended to apply the criteria defined in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization is set up a special account under the name &quot; special action account , &quot; which consists of the funds that the member states will contribute to the shareholders &apos; account ; this account is governed by the organization as a car@@ et@@ aker , and in accordance with the provisions specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the special transaction account is carried out separately , separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ its of the member state , to pay on demand in the currency of the respective state to pay the organization as administrator of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is made in two rates , and i ) the first in height of at least 45 v . h . &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time , between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual bud@@ get@@ ary plans . &quot;
C ) Any Member State may be able to make payments before the above mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedure of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about propor@@ tion@@ ate statements on cash or deb@@ unk@@ ers to cover the expenses for the loan loan and compens@@ ate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the provision of this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be derived from the following factors : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its other credit storage capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ advantage ; and
&quot; a ) the extent of which the problems of the countries concerned , by contributions from other sources , can be regulated . &quot;
&quot; each special transaction institution serves the financing of a clear and rapidly expanding development program ( including a sect@@ oral project ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the loan programme of the organization or not , according to the procedure and practices , which are considered to be the target of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special action account must not be used instead of the actual means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ mun@@ eration conditions that are generally applicable to the organization of the organization ; they are therefore pay@@ able for ten years in a period of 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the member states , and are pay@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to payment of this gift card are directly attri@@ but@@ able to the organization that re@@ tains it .
&quot; every special transaction is given by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the means is stated . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from each special transaction institution can be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services , which are produced or produced ( i ) in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and that which the car@@ et@@ aker could be appointed at the time of loan granted , may be the recipient of a special transaction . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments from special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is as soon as possible by the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State . &quot;
the administrator has been instruc@@ ted to complete the E@@ EC in preparation for the full disclosure of all the special ac@@ credi@@ tation holders in preparation and over the projects approved by the directors approved by the directors .
&quot; during the time of the down@@ payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator has been informed by the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses paid for this . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the administrator shall be transferred to the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the financial year of the organization . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC shall soon be noti@@ fied as soon as possible , a detailed report on the plans and programmes financed by the shareholders . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker produces and performs appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are depos@@ ited from the account , paid out from the account and the payments paid to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the aims of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the full issue of the funds of the special reaction @-@ account of time to time have a exchange of ideas on the state of the special reaction account , the continuation of the programmes or projects , and all other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; is this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the organization have not entered into force , the agreement and all the resulting commitments of the parties with immediate effect are due . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement , the total capital amount of all the recipients is ref@@ unded in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement , and all agreements of the parties with immediate effect are ended . &quot;
&quot; this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC , according to the legal provisions of each party . &quot;
the governments of the Member States comply with the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned .
the Secretary @-@ General direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper auth@@ orization of the agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
&quot; this agreement will be effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is in two juris@@ dic@@ tions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
&quot; in the consideration that the agreement is concluded in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ VE FO@@ L@@ GEN@@ DE AS@@ SO@@ CI@@ ATION : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and the Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE nuclear community , called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; is represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundesrat . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program encomp@@ asses the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a Common company based on chapters V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to &quot; &quot; Shar@@ eholders J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Swiss Hemp Initiative , collecting signatures at Pal@@ eo @-@ Festival Nyon 2005 &quot;
&quot; since until the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still extensive , it is in the interest of the contrac@@ ting parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and have achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable any contrac@@ ting party to be able to take advantage of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ k from the resources provided for the mutual research work , i.e. the cost @-@ effective electricity production by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contrac@@ ting parties are associated with their respective research programmes defined in App@@ endix I and II of this agreement defined below &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective collaboration , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or changed by articles from 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that may be relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contrac@@ ting parties accept a new program , this will take place in the position of the programs listed in App@@ endix I and II . &quot;
&quot; in paragraph 1 , association is realized by : - adequate participation in any of the parties during the preparation and implementation of the other party programmes ; &quot;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel among the laboratories in the Eur@@ atom member states , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that co @-@ operate at the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual rights to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; in the framework of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; with regard to carrying out the association agreement signed in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this agreement , the parties concluded an association agreement called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible , the association agreement between the Commission and the States and the Company or People , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Organ@@ ized Organ@@ s &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is taking part in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organ@@ ists , herein@@ after &quot; agreement on human exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland belongs to the present agreement to the Common company J@@ ET , whose stat@@ ute is accepted . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become the contrac@@ tual partner of any contract whose goal is to be concluded in the framework of the present agreement , except association contracts or other similar contracts that are concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , which are assigned to the association of the Association in Article 2 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in association agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , includes the suspension of a steering committee , which is responsible for the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;

&quot; the consultation groups , which are provided by the VG research proposals with regard to the fact that the means provided for the Eur@@ atom programme take the best possible scientific results , take this task in terms of all research and development work that is taken in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; the committee of directors , who supervis@@ es the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out in the programme of the programme are optim@@ ally used , are fu@@ elling the task of all research and development projects that are under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , he provides for the best possible deployment of the personnel and the exchange between the laboratories that are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in coordin@@ ating committees all within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordin@@ ating committees , which include the committee &apos;s committee , provide suitable proposals for the use of resources , personnel as well as the skills and capabilities of the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F comprises a representative of each member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the program and the possible changes in the align@@ ments , as well as the preparation of the future programmes and the establishment of its total comprehensive , coordin@@ ating and integration of national activities at the joint level in the merger . &quot;

&quot; the representatives of the two parties work on the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative committees , which will be created for the purposes of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland on the Eur@@ atom programme , according to this agreement , is set to pay a yearly amount to the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme in the same proportion as the GDP of Switzerland to the entire GDP of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Market as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Stat@@ ute of the Charter of this Common Company , Switzerland over@@ passes Switzerland to the Common company J@@ ET . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , the Eur@@ atom to finance the work as part of the association agreement and agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis that is normally used for the calculation of the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works that are carried out due to the relevant contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission will inform the Federal Council on the beginning of the year , which amount to cover expenses in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the next year . &quot;

&quot; in view of the multi@@ lateral trade negotiations and on the basis of trade negotiations on its meeting of November 11 and 12 , 1979 , as an expression of an agreement to implement the Article VII of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement , &quot;
&quot; in view of this , Article 27 of the Convention concerning changes has not yet been entered into force - I &quot;
1 . to cancel the agreement of Article 1 ( 2 b ) iv ) of the Convention ;
&quot; 2 . recognise that the application of this Convention on developing countries may be inadequate for five years according to Article 21 , 1 in practice for some developing countries . &quot;

&quot; it is the signat@@ ory of the Convention on the implementation of Article VII of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement , as well as other governments that join this Convention on Article 22 , for acceptance by signing or in other form . &quot;
&quot; in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on the trade with Hamm@@ el and lamb meat , &quot;
&quot; in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or ch@@ illed sheep , lamb and goats ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goats from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tonnes , expressed in batt@@ ali@@ on weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure a faul@@ t@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina is committed to ensuring that the amount of volume does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to the traditional offer ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change of the offer form as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the number 10 mentioned above to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the case that the community takes the protection clause , it is obliged to bear in mind that the access of Argent@@ inian access to the joint market will not be touched . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to set out the imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community is committed to limit the exhaus@@ tion of the products made by this agreement on a high rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; during the entry of new Member States , the community changes in consultation with Argentina , under number 2 , according to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new member state . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the accession treaty , the import duties for these new Member States shall be set in accordance with the provisions of the accession treaty ; this will be taken into account under number 5 . &quot;
&quot; the total amount of the total amount is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 23@@ ,000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight . &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ inian Hamm@@ el and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the commun@@ ion is occurring so that the sales of inter@@ ven@@ tional orders on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation , the sales of Argent@@ ine Hamm@@ el and lamb are not under@@ min@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that each actual application of funds or other subsidies for the export of Hamm@@ el and lamb , as well as to slaughter certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will only be reconc@@ iled with the existing international obligations and respect the traditional share of community in world trade with these articles . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees adher@@ ence to this agreement , in particular , that it is issued within the quantity of export lic@@ ences specified in this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in its turn , the community is committed to make all necessary arrangements so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products is based on an export license , which is designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system are set up so that on the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license can be disp@@ ens@@ ed .
&quot; in implementing regulations , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority in the responsible position of the community in regular intervals has been given orders for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be deci@@ ph@@ ered according to the destination country . &quot;
the committee is concerned that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency of the Hamm@@ el , lamb , and goats meat market of both parties and on the global market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee is concerned that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by this agreement , that products from Hamm@@ el , lamb , and goats are carried out under the agreement of non @-@ named tariff numbers after the community . &quot;
&quot; the Committee will discuss all issues relating to the implementation of these agreements , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement are in@@ descri@@ b@@ able to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with Hamm@@ el , lamb and goats &quot;
&quot; I bes@@ e@@ ech me to take the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goats from New Zealand into the community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goats . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep economy and the export of Hamm@@ el and lamb meat after the world market , and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand sheep and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honor the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or ch@@ illed sheep , lamb and goats ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement New Zealand is established for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goats for access to the market of the community in the agreed height . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal sales of its Hamm@@ el and Lam@@ b me@@ ats are not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure a proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is obliged to ensure that the amount of the volume does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the pre @-@ defined quantities are carried out in conventional offer ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
the community in@@ sures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the market of the community .
&quot; should a change of the offer form as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two parties consult each other before introducing such a change in the clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 , in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it is obliged to protect the New Zealand interests from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community is committed to restri@@ ct the exhaus@@ tion of the products made by this agreement on a high rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; on the accession of new Member States , the community changes in consultation with New Zealand , according to the extent of New Zealand trade with every new member state . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the accession treaty , the import duties for these new Member States shall be set in accordance with the provisions of the accession treaty ; this will be borne in clause 5 above clause 5 . &quot;
&quot; the total amount in clause 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community , to 245 500 tons of batt@@ ali@@ on weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development , which could compromise the normal sales of New Zealand sheep and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the fel@@ lowship is occurring so that the sales of inter@@ ven@@ tional orders on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of this goal are not under@@ min@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contrac@@ tual parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of meat in the community without danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that each actual application of funds or other subsidies for the export of Hamm@@ el and lamb , as well as to slaughter certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will only be reconc@@ iled with the existing international obligations and respect the traditional share of community in world trade with these articles . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand ensures compliance with the clause 2 mentioned in clause 2 , in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts . &quot;
&quot; in turn , the community is committed to make all necessary arrangements so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products with origin in New Zealand depends on the origin of export license , which is designated by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system are set up so that on the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license can be disp@@ ens@@ ed .
&quot; in implementing regulations , the competent authority of the competent authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals has been given orders for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be deci@@ ph@@ ered according to the destination country . &quot;
the Committee is concerned that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly checks the tendency on the Hamm@@ el , lamb and goats meat market of both parties and on the global market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions mentioned in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee is concerned that the proper application of the agreement is not affected by the agreement , that products from Hamm@@ el , lamb , and goats are carried out under the agreement of non @-@ named tariff numbers after the community . &quot;
&quot; the Committee will discuss all issues related to the implementation of the agreement arising from a contrac@@ ting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement are in@@ descri@@ b@@ able to the rights and obligations of the contrac@@ tual parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .

&quot; a reduction in blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples , which contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibodies or another on the label . &quot;
&quot; if a reduction in the recommended way is used by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the Tit@@ anic is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es to the double in a suitable medium .
&quot; the Tit@@ anic is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs , the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively in volume of blood cells in total volume . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents , which are intended to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time that is required for an ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organisation has set standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for the blood group determination of international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity are developed at the time standards . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the Tit@@ ans that are observed in single preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents to the blood group determination of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ sions in a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flood . &quot;
the Tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mix within a series where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B sc@@ iss@@ ors contain 256 international units per ml . &quot;

the expi@@ ration date for dry reag@@ ents is based on the results of the expi@@ ration tests ; it is appro@@ achable by the state supervis@@ ory authorities .
&quot; dry reag@@ ents are stored in an atmosphere of iner@@ tial gas or in a vacuum , while in the glass container in which they have been dried and that is so closed that no moisture can penet@@ rate . &quot;
a dry response may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxide in a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the sol@@ vents delivered with the dried reag@@ ents ) can be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiot@@ ic , as long as the reag@@ ent with the added substance remains the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy . &quot;
&quot; sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2,5 mg of protein per ml flu@@ ori@@ ce or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ ums . &quot;
&quot; the reag@@ ents , regardless of whether in a flu@@ ffy form or after the resur@@ rection , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; for the international exchange , certain reag@@ ents for blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least as long as not until an international agreement has reached a unified system . &quot;
&quot; reag@@ ents for blood group determination are in such a way and in such quantities , that in a container @-@ related reag@@ ent is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to perform tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
&quot; the amount must be so large , that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot;
the manufacturing laboratory has all the production stages and controls of reag@@ ents to lead to blood group determination .
&quot; appropriate samples of all returned reag@@ ents are so long from the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; the reag@@ ents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to rein@@ force the effectiveness and preservation of the Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups . &quot;
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents contain human origin only substances of human origin or that animal or plant reag@@ ents can not contain any substances of human origin .
&quot; every single container is a black @-@ white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the An@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um should be able to react with blood cells , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ a , which are intended for use of object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ c ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more people who are immune from the ag@@ glut@@ ino@@ gen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it respon@@ ds with floo@@ ds of human red blood cells that contain the An@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; this ser@@ a is therefore only specific to the C @-@ An@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells are absorbed in a 0,@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
the Tit@@ ans of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 to C@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .

&quot; based on the Common declaration adopted by the ministers of EF@@ TA countries and member states of the Community , as well as by the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 , the Common declaration adopted in Luxembourg , in particular with regard to simpli@@ fication of borders and origin rules , &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform . &quot;
&quot; in DER discretion , that this Convention may not be laid out , that it ent@@ ails the contrac@@ tual parties of their obligations from other international agreements - &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simpli@@ fy the con@@ sign@@ ments in goods traffic between the community and the EF@@ TA countries and between the individual EF@@ TA countries , and in particular , a uniform administrative court ( herein@@ after referred to as a unit paper ) , is to be used for all export and import procedures , as well as in goods traffic between the contrac@@ tual parties ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ greg@@ ations associated with the trade between the parties associated with the contrac@@ ting parties are fu@@ elled by a unit paper , for the impression of the pattern in the App@@ endix I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; depending on the case , the unit paper serves as a sign or paper for export , shipping method or import . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out the legal regulations applicable in a contrac@@ ting party , whose application would not be guaranteed by the sole use of the unit paper ; &quot;
&quot; - by the parties involved , so that they can come upon request in the enjoyment of an advantage or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not hin@@ der the contrac@@ tual parties , simplified procedures , even under the use of data processing , with regard to further facili@@ tation for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can be seen in particular , that the concerned goods do not submit to a customs office and the registration for these goods shall not be submitted to the customs office ; moreover , the delivery of an incomplete registration may be allowed . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , an application must subsequently be signed , with the consent of the competent authorities to act as a peri@@ odic case report , within the deadline set by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 may be allowed , instead of using the unit paper . &quot;
&quot; if the unit paper is used , the parties agree with the consent of the competent authorities to assist all involved with the export and import@@ ation of the supplements , instead of the suppl@@ ementary leaf@@ lets to the unit paper in the trade , in which the goods are described . &quot;
&quot; - to exclu@@ de each other agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of con@@ sign@@ ments to complete inventory , or for partial areas ; &quot;
&quot; - with ship@@ ments , which include several types of goods , to replace the for@@ kli@@ fts in the shipping method of charge @-@ lists instead of the suppl@@ ementary leaf@@ lets to the unit paper ; &quot;
&quot; - allow that applications may be created without pre @-@ printing , by public or private data processing systems , according to the conditions specified by the competent authorities ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the competent authorities to request the data required in their data processing systems for the treatment of regi@@ strations , and if necessary , without release of a written application ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the competent authorities in the case of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of regi@@ strations that the export , mail or import registration is either made by the unit paper or , if such a paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing plant ; &quot;
&quot; ( F ) stands for Facts , ( S ) for Students &apos; opinion , ( P ) for Professor &apos;s opinion and ( A ) for the opinion of the alumni . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of goods required for export , ship@@ ments and deliveries of goods required by the unit paper are laid down in App@@ endix II to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The common codes , which are listed in the App@@ endix I , are to be found in the App@@ endix III to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The registration is authorised in one of the official languages of the contrac@@ tual parties , which is authorised by the competent authorities of the country in which the con@@ sign@@ ments for export or ship@@ ments are fu@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the Cust@@ oms Authority may request a translation of registration in the official language or the official language of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In this case , the registration is always carried out in one of the official languages of the import @-@ country when it is used in this country using other than the copies of the Export or Ab@@ use case . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or its representative can only use the registration form for each individual proc@@ ed@@ ural section of a contract between the parties involved in this section , which may be required to assist the for@@ estation in one of the following sections . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The Commissioner shall not be entitled to a third party , a member of the executive board of the executive committee , or a member of the executive committee . &quot;
&quot; due to the special provisions of coll@@ ateral con@@ sign@@ ments , the relevant authorities can , however , fores@@ ee that the con@@ sign@@ ments for the export and the dispatch process will be applied to one and the same pre @-@ pressure by the copies intended for these con@@ greg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced as far as possible that the information contained in the copies of the signed copies of the registration shall be agreed . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure smooth goods transport between the parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or violations , customs authorities ask each other to seek or - if they are interested in another contrac@@ ting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The official aid can be completely or partially denied or rejected , if the requested country of view is that the aid would affect his security , the public order ( &quot; &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; &quot; ) or other essential interests , or viol@@ ate an operating , business or professional confi@@ denti@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) For refusal or refusal of the minist@@ erial assistance , the appropriate decision is to inform the respective decision and its justification for the seeking land . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is looking for assistance , which they cannot afford , if it would be sought , it indicates in their quest for this circum@@ stance . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information obtained pursuant to paragraph 1 shall only be used for the purposes of this Convention , and enjoy the protection of the country &apos;s internal law , which it has received , for information of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these information may only be used with written consent of the Cust@@ oms Authority , which she has granted , and the restrictions imposed by this authority shall be used elsewhere . &quot;
( 1 ) It is used to use a mixed committee in which any party party is represented by this Convention .
&quot; ( 4 ) The committee is a business organization , which , among other things , regul@@ ates the conven@@ ing of conferences and the appointment of the chairman and the duration of his term . &quot;
( 5 ) The committee can use sub@@ committees and working groups that support him in his tasks .
( 1 ) The committee has the task to manage this Convention and ensure its proper application .
&quot; for this purpose , the Committee shall regularly inform about practical experience with the application of the Convention ; he speaks recommendations and summari@@ zes in the cases pursuant to paragraph 3 decisions . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) The Committee decides on amend@@ ments to the app@@ endi@@ ces to this Convention , as well as in Article 4 paragraph 3 of the last thought of alle@@ vi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) Does the representative of a contrac@@ tual party assume a decision under the provision of the constitu@@ tive conditions , the decision , unless there is no date , on the first day of the second month after noti@@ fying the withdrawal of the reservation in force . &quot;
&quot; every contrac@@ ting party meets appropriate measures to ensure effective and well @-@ balanced implementation of this Convention , whereby the need to be taken into account is to reduce the burden of goods on the goods transport bur@@ dens as far as possible and to provide satis@@ factory solutions to the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the areas where the contract is set to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the other hand , on the other hand , as well as for the areas of EF@@ TA countries . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) This Convention is also applicable to Liechtenstein princip@@ ality , as long as the princip@@ ality is associated with the Swiss Con@@ federation by a customs treaty treaty . &quot;
&quot; each contrac@@ ting party can cancel this agreement with a twelve @-@ month deadline ; the written termination shall be directed to the Dep@@ os@@ itar , which is noti@@ fied of all other parties . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention will be held in force on 1 January 1988 in force , if the contrac@@ ting parties have depos@@ ited their approval documents by the Council of the European Communities until 1 November 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) If this Convention does not enter into force on 1 January 1988 , it will appear in force on the first day of the second month . &quot;
&quot; this Convention is adopted in a document in Danish , German , English , Finnish , French , Greek , Dutch , Italian , Dutch , Norwegian , Portuguese , Swedish , Portuguese , Swedish and Spanish . &quot;
&quot; I allow myself to propose the following agreement , which will serve as the basis for co @-@ operation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research . &quot;
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its Commission , is referred to as &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; , &quot; the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Council &quot; &quot; to ask recommendations regarding the management of fish stocks and related questions , and the Council will come as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; 2 . face the responsibility of the Commission in questions of management of fish stocks , the Council cons@@ ents to present all relevant reports of his working groups to assess the inventory position as well as the reports of his advis@@ ing fish@@ eries committee . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission will regularly provide advice on how cooperation between both parties can even intensi@@ fy , and in particular the possibilities to establish a closer link to the Commission &apos;s Advisory Committee . &quot;
&quot; 4 . the community will pay an amount of 3@@ 76 000 d@@ kr under the signing of this agreement , and then pay yearly payments . &quot;
&quot; in the annual fee not included , the costs of meetings held on special application of the Commission are not included in the annual contribution . &quot;
&quot; 5 . three years after the force of this agreement , the provisions of both parties will be reviewed . &quot;
&quot; no new provisions are agreed , the agreement shall be extended to the basis of existing provisions , until new agreements have been negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; at any time , every party has the chance to withdraw from the agreement with a one @-@ year period of notice . &quot;
&quot; in view of clause 3 , the Council agrees to recognise a scienti@@ fic@@ ally qualified representative of the Commission to recognise the observer status during meetings of the advisory committee on fish@@ eries management . &quot;
&quot; in this property , the representative of the Commission would have the right to ask the word and take part in the sessions , however , there would have been no voting right nor the possibility to change the day &apos;s orders . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would tell me if these agreements are acceptable as the basis of co @-@ operation between your council and the community for you .
I assume that this letter and answer to the agreement on cooperation between the International Council for Marine Research and the European Economic Community .

&quot; the parties of the agreement signed on December 15 , 1950 signed a agreement on the establishment of a council for co @-@ operation in the customs office . &quot;
&quot; in the statement that it is desirable that on 14 June 1983 in Brussels , the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and coding of goods on 1 January 1988 enters into force . &quot;
