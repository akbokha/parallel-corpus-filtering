the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which it is explained how the committee for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies conducted to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package delivery ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inser@@ ting ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ ls thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental disorder where the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) have altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used for treating moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
&quot; the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if oral intake of the medicine is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or the enam@@ el tablets in patients , which are causing the swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving other medicines at the same time , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is pres@@ um@@ ably the &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the rec@@ ept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but lower than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or mental symptoms and their recovery is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy , which prevents recur@@ rence of the symptoms , was examined in three studies by up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared to 8@@ 05 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and Plac@@ ebo which had been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients receiving treatment . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body is res@@ or@@ bing the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to absorb ( absor@@ bs ) . &quot;
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients showed A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased anxiety than patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; when applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition , abili@@ fy prevented the re @-@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administ@@ ered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses reduced also more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled sugar@@ s ) , ac@@ ath@@ emia ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( di@@ gestion ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the committee for humanitarian medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly talked about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to weigh over risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . approval for the provision of A@@ bili@@ fy across the European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly used man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day every day regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy of dos@@ ages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of the meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders , and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ etic and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol occurring dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; when in a patient with abili@@ fy patients signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur , it should be taken to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zu@@ res in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or conditions associated with var@@ ic@@ ose attacks . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased mort@@ ality rate compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed doses , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients associated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active ingredients to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ ses , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly in relation to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in general , weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , caution is recommended when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as sedi@@ mentation ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist is Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in the case of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metaboli@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy , the potential benefits out@@ weigh potential risks for patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dose of the dose before the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 will be administ@@ ered together with abili@@ fy with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies , 10 @-@ 30 m@@ g. of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol per day no significant effect on metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phic ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to insufficient data storage for people and due to the concerns caused in the animal &apos;s reproduction studies , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics patients should be warned against dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol does not have any negative impact on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including par@@ in@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ emia , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of eps 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under semi @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term period of 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , there was no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zu@@ res , un@@ desirable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ doses of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with este@@ emed doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in treating an over@@ dose of benefits , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma connection . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder has the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- rec@@ ept@@ ors , and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recep@@ tor and a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ aline and the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; a dose @-@ dependent reduction of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor @-@ lig@@ ands , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor @-@ lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ amen . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 of the Literatur@@ ang @-@ patients who taught a response to the study medicine were similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks to stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction of the return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with more flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms more than 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed doses of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies more than 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior effectiveness in week 3 and a reduction effect that was comparable with the lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie , such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partially over 2 weeks did not apply to li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um , a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ zation phase , in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in prevention of a return to the man@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzyme C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ d@@ ration and hydro@@ xy@@ regulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which is cataly@@ sed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation sh@@ al period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol for extensive metaboli@@ tes using C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ tes of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a pop @-@ simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in the ethni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar to patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot; a single dose study of subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated capsules , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not be detected any special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ ni@@ er@@ eal toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a consequence of the pre@@ cip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3@@ times of the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , in the human G@@ alle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. found at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is no more than 6 % of the concentrations that were found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ u@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 times of the mean ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol occurring dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder has the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- rec@@ ept@@ ors , and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; 22 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ zation phase , in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in prevention of a return to the man@@ ie . &quot;

&quot; it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder has the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- rec@@ ept@@ ors , and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; 46 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ zation phase , in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in prevention of a return to the man@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day , regardless of the meals . &quot;
patients who have difficulty in swal@@ lowing of abili@@ fy tablets may take the melt tablets alternatively to abili@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; in some cases , the inci@@ dence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior is reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol occurring dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , altern@@ ating levels of consciousness and signs of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm distur@@ ban@@ ces ) . &quot;
&quot; in general , weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;

&quot; it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder has the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- rec@@ ept@@ ors , and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed doses of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio @-@ fe@@ asi@@ bility study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics was compared with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in tablet form with healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ MA@@ x mean the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3@@ times of the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 times of the mean ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; abili@@ fy injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ ility and behavior in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and begin with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under circum@@ ference of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
&quot; a lower dose of 5,@@ 25 mg ( 0,@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used already for recovery or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a secondary treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine by abili@@ fy tablets , abili@@ fy melt tablets or abili@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar I disorder .
&quot; in case of par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme sedi@@ mentation or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;

&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ etic and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol occurring dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a joint are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , altern@@ ating levels of consciousness and signs of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm distur@@ ban@@ ces ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ ses , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly in relation to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in general , weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared with the following treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study , in the healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as one @-@ time @-@ time intra@@ mus@@ cular , while the same time was used intra@@ mus@@ cular at the same time . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist is Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in the case of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , in comparison to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metaboli@@ tes can result in a common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dose of the dose before the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;

&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , there was no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zu@@ res , un@@ desirable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;

the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % higher in the first 2 hours after intra@@ mus@@ cular injection 90 % higher the AU@@ C after giving the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time up to reaching the maximum plasma level is 1 to 3 hours . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys , resulting in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated treatment with a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , 15@@ - or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cular . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study on which 460 women participated in metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters of which had previously been an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication of a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot;
&quot; only patients who were treated for metast@@ atic breast cancer were treated with regard to efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of disease and survival , no difference between the medicines . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who previously received other treatments of their metast@@ atic breast cancer were related to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients , bre@@ ast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low neutr@@ ons in the blood . &quot;
the committee for Human@@ medicine ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with which the first treatment did not appear more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was not to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects compared to other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metast@@ atic disease is missing and is not shown for the standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neutral phil@@ ately &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neuro@@ path@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in sensory neuro@@ path@@ y degree 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data to evaluate dose adjustments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for harm@@ fulness and efficacy .

&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot;
&quot; in patients , there should be no renewed abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles , until the neutral number is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and increase the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number again &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while an un@@ common cardi@@ om@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not detected in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac incidents in the indicated patients are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of the patient after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or with women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice any effective contrac@@ eption , except the mother &apos;s treatment with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is inevitable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply to Abra@@ x@@ ane during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after treatment no child . &quot;
male patients should be advised prior to treatment on a sper@@ mat@@ ogen@@ esis because of the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect traffic and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important cases of side effects which occurred in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III study all three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .

the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two succ@@ essive un@@ connected studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparison study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi@@ centric study was performed in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , either in the form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 . &quot;

&quot; • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the drug ( technical information ) , labelling and packaging materials . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicinal product , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicine &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in which blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if a bleeding sp@@ end@@ ent is not possible before the procedure , and where a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 m@@ l. is expected . &quot;
the treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with diseases that the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or , as long as they receive adequate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure , or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administ@@ ered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or that the body does not adequ@@ ately address the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing the consequences of blood loss . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with an injection into a v@@ ein within a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks ago E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they either switched to se@@ amed or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
the company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study of patients suffering from kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as with those who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ ra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the committee for humanitarian medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of evidence , the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
&quot; symptoms and fol@@ li@@ cles can vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease conditions is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed via or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; symptoms and complications may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease conditions is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required to control the symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased to ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be kept three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be raised three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg , 3 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with slight an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit , 33 - 39 % ) , in which the preventive detention of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ser@@ um is required , ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; with the iron substitution , as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , large iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine in the circuit . &quot;
patients suffering from the treatment with some er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia and PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ or@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ embo@@ li@@ sm ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are fores@@ een for a larger electrical orth@@ op@@ edic procedure and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lusion , vas@@ cular disease of the car@@ oti@@ tis or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ per@@ ver@@ ted PR@@ CA after months and years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect , the reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need of trans@@ fu@@ sions should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ contact ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ ty toxic@@ ation@@ , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro @-@ litre or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row should be taken to diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ virus @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 Recommen@@ ded upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
in clinical studies an increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk for serious cardiovascular events was observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis stimul@@ ants ( ESA ) were given by more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ine , when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased to the control of symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing hyper@@ tension .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ ct cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ gestive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 Recommen@@ ded upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al failure . &quot;
&quot; for the evaluation of the treatment efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa gift and er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients who need to be trans@@ founded ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 , to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ ting with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk reduction in the respective patient &apos;s involvement that should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia before the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater electrical orth@@ op@@ edic procedure should receive adequate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ose@@ proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an increased risk of post@@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cular events may not be ruled out in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven that they can improve overall survival in tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or decrease the risk of tum@@ our progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer who received chemotherapy after a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ do@@ sis should be adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;

&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it may occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent rise in the amount of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which will return to further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to control the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency , should be taken into account and before the start of the therapy with se@@ amed . &quot;
very rare was reported about the appearance of an anti@@ per@@ ver@@ ted er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ oma after months and years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spray ) Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ stop@@ en@@ ie , it will break your therapy with se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is treated best . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ously ) , if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to a kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ite value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; if you have increased or increasing pot@@ assi@@ um levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with se@@ amed until the pot@@ assi@@ um values are in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or di@@ gestion , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; after the time of the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with abor@@ tion in adults with chronic kidney failure ( kidney failure ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al failure . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for the evaluation of the effectiveness of se@@ amed .
&quot; 200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly , to keep the risk of bleeding ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible . &quot;
&quot; this risk should be carefully chosen from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary embo@@ li@@ sm ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , remember that ab@@ se@@ amed as a growth factor for blood cells , and in certain circumstances can influence the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orth@@ op@@ edic surgery , before treatment starts with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ es ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of bleeding after the operation . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other drugs / have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means for suppression of the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory investigations have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) are means for the development of the immune system ( e.g. cancer - chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood sugar ( an@@ a@@ emia ) refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will need regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is not exceeded .
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;

&quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it has to be used either within 3 days or disc@@ arded . &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ itt@@ le ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like in the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol may reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for evaluating Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included two 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two trials in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared for six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indication for the efficacy was , whether the content of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that re@@ builds the bone substance ) in the blood again , or at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study of older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis surgery ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion centre and oste@@ on@@ ect@@ omy ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta manufactures re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited approval for the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The packaging material • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and bre@@ ast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing care &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; to treat post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who have responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta In@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol , may be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen briefly after applying acet@@ am@@ ol . &quot;
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years , since data are missing for safety and efficacy . &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because there are only limited clinical experiences for this patient population .
a pre @-@ existing hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia is performed before the start of the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene , should be done before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental treatment , there are no data available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the treating doctor should be the basis for each patient &apos;s treatment plan and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen may be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta were increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - recur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;

kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ric acid has been associated with kidney function distur@@ ban@@ ces associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases than acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( per year before the administration ) and the inci@@ dence of ren@@ al failure and a limited ren@@ al function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and Plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the treatment was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values which were below normal fluctu@@ ations ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get trials . &quot;
&quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently discovered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion station , such as red@@ dening , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen was Occ@@ ult , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ric acid . &quot;

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparison studies .
&quot; after 6 months of the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to the initial value of Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at was observed . &quot;
patients who were treated at the end of the six @-@ month study ( on therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from 143 to Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response of 141 of patients treated with the risk of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at was maintained in a medium period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be a dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma levels rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the peak value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a prolonged phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ polar dis@@ appearances from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination phase 1 ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early stages ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) , pres@@ um@@ ably represent the rapid absorption in bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the given dose is found in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body Clear@@ ance amounts to 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance by using Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ric acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is not a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dys@@ function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min .
&quot; because of severe kidney function disorder ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only available data are available , there are no statements available for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ recur@@ ring intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.9 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in trials of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are the 6@@ times of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administ@@ ered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was determined by a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the 7@@ times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , corresponding to the AU@@ C , equivalent to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects of other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ cal met@@ aphy@@ si@@ cs of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tic effect of the substance . &quot;
&quot; in rats , one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in doses of 0,2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; in ra@@ bb@@ its , no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to reduced ser@@ um calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; usually 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a sub@@ strate class called Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the murder of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormon@@ es , mainly est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alized the bone reconstruction , thereby guarant@@ e@@ eing normal bone formation and gives the bone again strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other drugs or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , of which it is known to harm the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , you worry that you should take enough fluid in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administ@@ ered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to take Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which will be administ@@ ered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta has a long time , you will need another dose after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that calcium levels are not too low in your blood during the time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than one year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration missed Ac@@ la@@ sta , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you consider the completion of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please contact your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent after subsequent inc@@ isions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta is causing this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you get Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently reduced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture is recommended to increase the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures .
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important in patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on the bone structure , temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia will develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently reduced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package delivery ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a diet and exercise , A@@ compli@@ a is applied to the treatment of adult patients who suffer from a body massage index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or , or more or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out to more than 7 000 patients in which AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LIA was used in comparison to a plac@@ ebo as a supp@@ or@@ tive remedy for setting the smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of the room showed no uniform results , so that the effect of AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LIA was difficult to estimate on this application area . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LIA ? it is the most common side effects of AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LIA , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . &quot;
&quot; it may also be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression , and among other things , in a small minority of patients suffering from su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; caution is recommended when applying AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LIA with medicines like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( drugs against fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means to use HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;

Summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which it is explained how the committee for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies conducted to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
&quot; it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ ide or insulin , the present dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ ation or insulin can be maintained with the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level is reduced , which makes type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ ide , in addition they received either acet@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ lic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tos led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced when applying the dosage of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional offering of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ ide in a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional delivery of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , patients receiving acet@@ ate in addition to insulin , decreased H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ cr@@ y@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ( high level of ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is intended to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , in which Met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission announced Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for the transfer of Ac@@ tos across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the wor@@ ding &quot; &quot; ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , whose blood sugar with insulin is inadequate and with which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for application of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone in patients under 18 years , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients affected by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma , when Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing macro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of liver enz@@ ym@@ ers ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ eric values are as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has developed symptoms that indicate a hep@@ atic dys@@ function , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , over@@ weight loss , ti@@ red@@ ness , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon should be continued , should be guided by the clinical evaluation of the laboratory parameters . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can stir from fat deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparable controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , in patients who receive pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ ide or dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the introduction of the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ onen , including Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon , a inci@@ dence or deteri@@ oration of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone and the inci@@ dence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but the doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients complain about disorders of the visual acu@@ ity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of un@@ desired events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone &quot;
the calculated question@@ naire was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation .
&quot; in the Pro@@ active Study , a study about 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or this entry , the treatment is to be set ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Dig@@ oxin , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon around the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernal animal reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ us growth .

&quot; in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing macro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the inci@@ dence of severe heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon or . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch , in@@ suffici@@ ency among pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone has been reported , however , if Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials were conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparison medi@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon were compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day more than seven days did not occur . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon seems to have an activation of specific core rec@@ ept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator @-@ γ ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to examine the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient , despite three months of optim@@ isation phase with insulin , was random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who remained only insulin . a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ oti@@ ent compared to the starting values . &quot;
the effect of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small survey on type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was observed , while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon was not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post@@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ active Study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients were random@@ ised with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing macro@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups ranging from up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral use , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon is quickly res@@ or@@ b@@ ished , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone in the plasma usually reach 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon had no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Dig@@ oxin , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ actively mark@@ eted Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon in humans , the marker was found mainly in the F@@ ä@@ zes ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon and its metaboli@@ tes are lower than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ trophy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that in treatment with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone , hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernal animal decreases , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ us growth . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased inci@@ dences of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epithel@@ ium were induced . &quot;
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ans resulted in increased frequency of colon@@ os@@ por@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the wor@@ ding &quot; &quot; ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the calculated question@@ naire was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation .
&quot; in the Pro@@ active Study , a study about 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of Met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were examined . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ oti@@ ent showed in comparison to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zon did not only reduce the no@@ od@@ ly tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post@@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was the target of its primary end@@ point , which resulted in a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ lethal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the bone , cor@@ on@@ ary Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with taking Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the wor@@ ding &quot; &quot; ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as does not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ der , suggesting that the blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be removed ) . &quot;
the committee for humanitarian medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane benefits out@@ weigh the risks associated with diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S auth@@ orization for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection na@@ del must be left under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar setting improved significantly , for example , has significantly improved the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin an@@ alogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA from animal origin ) can lead to a change of the dosage . &quot;
&quot; if changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose adjustment is required , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such jour@@ neys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken in other times . &quot;
&quot; the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in therapy , and will always ask his patients to other medicines taken by them . &quot;
&quot; 4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled di@@ ab@@ etic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in u@@ ter@@ o . &quot;

disorders of the skin and under@@ floor tissue may occur - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection point a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur if failed to change the deposits within the injection area .
&quot; local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ om can occur at the injection site ) . &quot;

&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be gradually developed : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugar @-@ containing foods . &quot;
&quot; di@@ abe@@ tics should always have grape varieties , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cuits , or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ ites with in@@ hibition are treated with an intra@@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a weigh@@ ted au@@ xiliary handle or by glucose which is given intra@@ ven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is due to the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of sp@@ litt@@ ing ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human ins@@ ul@@ in@@ molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the metaboli@@ tes produced by the division are active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated capsules , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can not be detected any special dangers for humans . &quot;
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane flow bottle is taken from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not exceeding 25 ° C ) before it is used for the first use according to the instructions for use .

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already identified signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or casting notes ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger urine sedi@@ ments that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary acid is still more than 6 mg per deci@@ liter , the dose can be increased once a day , 120 mg daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atic complaints may occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients will take at least more medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do drug ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol ( another drug used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol was used in a dose of 300 mg daily ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid levels were in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who participated in the last three measurements in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with heart defects in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the committee for humanitarian medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the reduction of ur@@ inary acid in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the patient &apos;s history ) , or currently present toxic@@ ity and / or arthritis . &quot;
&quot; after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase of 1 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be considered a dose increase at A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 times a day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restri@@ ction , efficacy and safety are not yet fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents , since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; since it does not have any experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ emic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure treatment is not recommended to Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ acid @-@ resistant drugs , it can occur during the treatment beginning due to acute toxic@@ ity because by lowering the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid level , ur@@ inary acid deposits can be mobili@@ zed in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. in case of mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it is to be depos@@ ited in the urine tract . &quot;
&quot; during the clinical trials of Phase 3 , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the Feb@@ ux@@ et treatment , and in the further course , depending on the clinical findings and the liver function test ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ war was not done any interaction studies at Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll lens ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; the simultaneous treatment of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ex@@ position ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors did not stand in connection with a clin@@ ically significant increase of unwanted events .

&quot; with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl . 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ Is and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the persistent decrease in ser@@ um acid levels was found at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a feed @-@ feed ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a feeding feed ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the plaster size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the pla@@ ins by month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .

&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is observed an increase in AU@@ C , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentration was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;

these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ Met@@ aboli@@ zation and urine composition and is considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day did not affect the fertility and reproduction performance of male and female rats .
&quot; in high doses , which were approximately 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which accompanied by a reduction in the inci@@ dence of growth and a development delay in the desc@@ endants of rats . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bones are br@@ itt@@ le ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient needs to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lay down after the first food intake of the day that should take place in the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company put data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) than with those who took only al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also provided data that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is exactly the dose prescribed for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the locom@@ otor system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the di@@ gestive system , such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ cer@@ a ( blo@@ cker ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) , as well as aci@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand upright or sit at least 30 minutes . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following hints are exactly to follow in order to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE should be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not be chew@@ ed or t@@ opping the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ zer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not be taken before the first food intake of the day that should take place in the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ la@@ sty , only under particular caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; ob@@ itu@@ dinal reactions such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ ings , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( some were severe and required a hospital assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore be aware of all signs and symptoms that indicate potential violations such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing so@@ aking the medicine and obtain medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an er@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was found , rare ( after market launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ zer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ect@@ omy of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime mainly contains intra@@ ven@@ ously administ@@ ered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there are no data available to indicate whether the substitution of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure reduce the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the treating doctor is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take the tablet in the next morning when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets per day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the planned day of the week . &quot;
other diseases that affect the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ tis ) should also be treated adequ@@ ately before the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore patients must wait for at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , before they take other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interactions were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only intended for the application of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither applied during pregnancy nor of bre@@ ast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not cause any indication of direct harmful effects in regard to pregnancy that can detect embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ect@@ omy of the Ki@@ ef@@ ers was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .

bio@@ availability increased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken or taken half an hour before a stand@@ ar@@ dised breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change of oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Distribution studies of rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed in soft tissues after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of 1 mg / kg , but then circul@@ ated rapidly into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate there were approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance within 72 hours with the urine ex@@ cre@@ ted and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the di@@ ces .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance did not pass 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted on the acid or bas@@ al transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the elimination of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;

the mean maximum concentration in the ser@@ um ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and medi@@ an time to reaching the maximum ser@@ um concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
&quot; in the liver , biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D3 is hydro@@ xy@@ ated in the liver and then in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ phen@@ yl D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form . &quot;
&quot; elimination of radio@@ actively mark@@ eted vitamin D3 in healthy subjects was 2.4 % in the urine after 48 hours , in the fet@@ ces after 4 days 4.9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bones , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted into the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , however , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in the animal studies can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with limited ren@@ al function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bones is expected ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administ@@ ered by adult patients to prevent kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ ant@@ f with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients who were dead after a year of treatment ( by investigating how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
&quot; in addition , recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were carried out and examined how adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body . &quot;

patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; conversion of the form@@ ulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood @-@ mirror regulations ( see below &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; after conversion from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 , the systemic exposure , measured as a talent mirror , was comparable to both ni@@ ers and le@@ ber@@ cul@@ tured patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation period .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearing , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ D@@ os@@ is@@ schem@@ as may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;

D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in specific patient groups with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces .
patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can assume that a dose adjustment is not required .
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um canc@@ ell@@ ates , calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ lear@@ ance and a monitoring of the volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ant@@ f In the conversion of a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is careful ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; in the first line on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case , the dose should be based on the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus disease controls . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled by modi@@ fying Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , Changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , modifications of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has joined . &quot;
the indications in clinical trials suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the levels of seb@@ um can not exceed 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the talent levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and gl@@ ands - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; change of form@@ ulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ tis , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded form@@ ulation adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recep@@ tions in the child age , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded form@@ ulation adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedi@@ es can be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases it was described as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy to observe chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trophy , which can therefore occur under the adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections , fluid retention and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ tis , sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun@@ screen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mp@@ s and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ les , re@@ tar@@ ded , lac@@ tose is included in patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption special care . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedi@@ es , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level is advis@@ able to monitor the C@@ YP@@ 3A metabolism , and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain consistent concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a and that the hormone exposure can increase , it is particularly cau@@ tious in decision @-@ taking measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearing of Pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ life time .
the results of a low number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born may be recommended for any harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;

it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated ly@@ mph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ u@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot@@ eins can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
action mechanisms and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level should be medi@@ ated by the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell .
&quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thereby preventing transcription of a certain number of Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ kin genes . &quot;

&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral programming in these published studies showed the observations in the major studies in which Progra@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tor to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation in an intermediate analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric study with oral programming was reported by more than 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within a 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus came to 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the development of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 38.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients who were killed by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33,@@ 3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the inci@@ dence of the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome was significantly lower with the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi @-@ centric study with oral programming was carried out to 205 patients at the same time as a pan@@ cre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ised trial of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the target levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; intestinal transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral programming as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tations revealed in 155 patients ( 65 only gut , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ tations ) under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on an updated survival rate of 75 % to 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; factors like a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ us value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or by treating cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids will be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this can be concluded that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly carried out by the G@@ alle . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients , which were converted by Progra@@ f ( twice a day ) at ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was less than 10 % lower than under Progra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ tis , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded form@@ ulation adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood cl@@ amping disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ate is used for treating bleeding or preventing bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human sense factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called re@@ bin@@ ate , similar but is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined for preventing bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , advanced search , download of results and much more .

&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ergy factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the transfer of lawyers throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period is not to fall under the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the norm or I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections , an appropriate determining factor VIII @-@ plasma levels should be recommended . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , reaching different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different semi @-@ precious times . &quot;
3 Proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities cannot be reached , or if the bleeding is not ruled out with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . however , the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII @-@ directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plasma by modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors were observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation is no experience . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ R@@ s in the largest number of AD@@ R@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which had previously untreated patients who had a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) .

&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE , 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostics of severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VIII ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2,4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed difficult to moderate H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was observed after previous exposure to factor VIII ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by the study of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters , and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients the inci@@ dence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes were reported in several repeated product positions within the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval of the approval , CH@@ MP has continued to consider the benefit risk assessment , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;

&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited officially announced that the company re@@ jects its application for the provision of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , bones , or the soft parts ( tissues , which connects other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been modified genetically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which has so changed so that there are no copies of itself , and therefore no infections can trigger . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to again form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein that is made from the p@@ 53 gene , which is not def@@ ective in the human body , contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and killing the cells if the DNA can not be restored . &quot;
&quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company laid out data from a study involving a patient with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub @-@ construction , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the inspection of the initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP on day 120 creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors has benefits for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proved that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;

&quot; modified active ingredients &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is slowly released over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( ha@@ y fever ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; in adults and adolescents aged 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effect dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of ha@@ y fever symptoms which were reported by patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in view of all ha@@ y fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported to receive Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , over a decrease of the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardiac arrest ) , oral dro@@ ught , di@@ zz@@ iness , depression , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or lau@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for treating allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vas@@ cular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension ) or a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the provision of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without cr@@ ushing , breaking or chew@@ ing ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , since long @-@ term application can reduce the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time . &quot;
&quot; after a decrease of the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attri@@ but@@ able to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctions such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al as a sw@@ elling of the Rhin@@ ology kum ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rin , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ ard etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s body , and the data is insufficient to address appropriate recommendations for the dosage . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces , and the data is insufficient to address appropriate recommendations for dosage . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed that the treatment of the inci@@ dence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm distur@@ ban@@ ces , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or head@@ aches of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bubble bath ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to conducting der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines may otherwise be able to prevent adverse reactions on indicators of skin reactions or to reduce their size . &quot;
&quot; as part of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administ@@ ered , there were no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the results of psych@@ om@@ otor tests showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme has not yet been identified for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hi@@ bits in vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; the in@@ adequ@@ acy of the use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experiences from a large number of affected pregnant women , however , no increase of the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ated characteristics of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic @-@ ti@@ ghtness or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a zinc stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible tablets . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , difficult micro @-@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ ous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , ax@@ ia , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S stimulation is especially prob@@ able in children , as well as A@@ tro@@ phic symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ ine on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of the flight range including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can cause more sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S path@@ ogen . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 248 patients participated in the age of 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , where 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ ist efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the weak@@ ening effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin via the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethni@@ cal affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the administration is administ@@ ered . &quot;

a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin after the sole gift of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin bio@@ equivalent was the exposure to the offering of an aer@@ os@@ ol tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not be recognized for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination possessed no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin . &quot;
in re@@ productive sto@@ x@@ ical studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was not at@@ tained in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bit in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 has been established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a physical substance that can un@@ fold its effect . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets reli@@ eves symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and drinking or ju@@ icy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat for inser@@ ting ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged between 1 and five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2,5 m@@ g. a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies on seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and two studies in patients who had also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the efficacy was measured by modi@@ fying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ric@@ eps , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to remove and the enam@@ el tablets used in the same way as the tablets and the application of children is harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was to an average decrease of the symptoms of symptoms ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ER@@ I@@ US may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission announced that SP Europe &apos;s European Commission approved an approval for the transport of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( inci@@ dence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease process , and may be termin@@ ated after the end of the symptoms and re@@ plen@@ ish them again . &quot;
&quot; in the per@@ sist@@ ing allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( inci@@ dence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administ@@ ered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ ER@@ I@@ US and alcohol the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol is not increased ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic @-@ ti@@ ghtness or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effects of head@@ aches , which were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times clinical dose ) were administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ ine on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a daily dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of the flight range including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in reducing symptoms such as kidney , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ sist@@ ing allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the inci@@ dence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as based on the overall score of the question@@ naire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US effectively dimin@@ ishes the stress caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology regardless of the eti@@ ology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving pre@@ valence and lowering of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
&quot; an improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients are comparable with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , this enzyme has not yet been identified for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hi@@ bits in vi@@ vo not C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7,5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed a comparable level of the exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated capsules , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin will not be able to recognize any special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; colour@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hypo@@ x@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ER@@ I@@ US can be taken independently of the meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ ber doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data is available that support a treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis can play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations . &quot;
&quot; about 6 % of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is limited and experienced a higher sub@@ sistence level ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is limited to metabolic , is identical to the children that are normally metaboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients should not use the her@@ edit@@ ary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ I@@ som@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administ@@ ered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets and alcohol the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol is not increased ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall inci@@ dence of adverse events between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , which came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1,@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are similar to adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for more than ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents is no increased inci@@ dence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was neither a rein@@ forcement of alcohol @-@ induced performance imp@@ air@@ ment nor an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as kidney , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as based on the overall score of the question@@ naire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving pre@@ valence and lowering of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restri@@ cting phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study using the sy@@ rup form@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
the loading ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ally half @-@ life time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) more than 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable with the recommended doses which were comparable with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , this enzyme has not yet been identified for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ i@@ ding bottles with a child @-@ proof poly@@ prop@@ ylene closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dosage of the ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ats can be removed without damaging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally used ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which was used up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin had been used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as kidney , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as based on the overall score of the question@@ naire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US effectively dimin@@ ishes the stress caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;

there is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging them . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 2.5 mg fusion tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall inci@@ dence of the side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was equal and not significant from the safety profile in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melt tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg conventional tablets form@@ ulation and the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat for the engaging wor@@ ding of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin had been used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement values of the flight range including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly metaboli@@ sing phen@@ otype was comparable to adul@@ th@@ ood ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melt tablet with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 2,5 mg tablets were not studied on pap@@ edi@@ atric patients , but in connection with the dose of infection in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melt tablets uses the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;
&quot; food has no significant influence on AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x by A@@ ER@@ I@@ US , Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat , while food T@@ max by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin from 2.5 to 4 hours and T@@ max of 3 @-@ O@@ H@@ - Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin from 4 to 6 hours . &quot;
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melt tablet showed that this wor@@ ding is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical application .
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;

&quot; a A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg fusion tablet once daily in the mouth , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg enam@@ al tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg conventional tablets form@@ ulation and the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat for the engaging wor@@ ding of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin had been used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in an 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as kidney , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg fusion tablets with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melt tablet showed that this wor@@ ding is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in children between 2 and 11 years , which is limited to metabolic , is identical to the children that are normally metaboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take . &quot;
the overall inci@@ dence of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin Group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events were reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , with a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin &apos;s solution , no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents is no increased inci@@ dence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in addition to established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis can alternatively be allergic to the duration of the symptoms or in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and &quot;
&quot; as based on the overall score of the question@@ naire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets effectively reduce the stress caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restri@@ cting phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ ER@@ I@@ US solution to inhal@@ ed the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no bio@@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it is equivalent to the sy@@ rup and tablets . &quot;
&quot; in various individual dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable with the recommended doses with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company re@@ jects its application for the provision of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special type of vacc@@ ine , which could cause future pan@@ dem@@ ics before a stem from the flu virus , which could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain emerg@@ es from the flu virus which can easily spread by humans , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after the vacc@@ ine is administ@@ ered , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus as &quot; body @-@ alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the immune system is later able to form the immune system in a contact with a flu virus of this pedi@@ gre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognis@@ es as body @-@ alien ) is dis@@ connected , cleaned and used as a component of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; thus , the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vacc@@ ine to meet the requirements of the EMEA &apos;s guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for inclusion , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral drugs of the patient previously , and the likelihood that the virus will respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice a day , which together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ather@@ os@@ cl@@ ero@@ sis depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; to cure AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system , and thus the development of AIDS connected with AIDS , can also delay the development of AIDS related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the medicine A@@ generic has been used with low @-@ dos@@ ed ri@@ p@@ ples , which were used in 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indication for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in trials involving patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ als also reduced the viral load , but the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were only very few in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load increased to 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ ants : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger decrease in viral load after four weeks than in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ generic ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and Fati@@ gue ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r or one of the other ingredients ) .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients , St. John &apos;s Wort ( an herbal supplement for treating depression ) or drugs , which are just like A@@ gener@@ ase , and in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ phy ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ generating immune system ) . &quot;
the committee for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally allowed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since the approval of scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited approval for the provision of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r are to be administ@@ ered together with low doses of rite avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic Cap@@ s@@ ules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of asp@@ ir@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day , combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on the in@@ adequ@@ acy and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , it should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces to 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dys@@ function , it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver function disorder ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width , and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ o@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
plant preparations containing Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules should be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal progression .
&quot; for the case of a simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with premature hep@@ atitis function , including chronic hep@@ atitis , show an increased frequency of liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ tic oids , which are metaboli@@ zed using C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treating the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of as@@ generation with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the elevated risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ubar@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
patients who use this medicine at the same time can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be changed , but the information is insufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ generic solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the inci@@ dence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , or an ex@@ pe@@ dient of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us . &quot;
many of the patients had other illnesses which were needed to treat medicines that are associated with the development of a diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ äm@@ ophil@@ a patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ atom@@ as and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis are reported . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resistant opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body @-@ mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic beam A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ o@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ generic with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly used by C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already involved in St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ atal levels and , if possible , to check the viral load and replace the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x compared to 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dosage of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and rite avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , confir@@ ming the efficacy and safety of this treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
52 % lower when am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) combined with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administ@@ ered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r and KA@@ LE@@ TRA cannot be given , however a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and reliability of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study to use A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the imagin@@ ative component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ par@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rite avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment needed . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z combined with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ eas@@ ants and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin possibly lowers the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this medicine should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if this medicine is used together , caution is provided ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken , as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous treatment of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by 193 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
&quot; the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ pin ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ x compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous application of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions with ather@@ os@@ cl@@ ero@@ sis . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as as@@ par@@ ase as it can occur to res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ tis , known as enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@
&quot; simultaneous taking with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with the associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the rite avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval between 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous determination of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of treating the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , the increase in plasma levels is expected to be expected at the same time . &quot;
&quot; as plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ ubar@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased in the same amount of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be used together with oral @-@ recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while using par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administ@@ ered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the small negli@@ gence of historical compar@@ isons , there is no recommendation to be given as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adjusted when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; during the same treatment of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ generic , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcing the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an extra administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not predic@@ t@@ ably , therefore alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption prevention . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the same amount of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tic rats , am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered by the U@@ ter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a decreased increase of 12 body weight during the follow @-@ up period . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproduction , was not imp@@ aired by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal . &quot;
the im@@ perman@@ ence of ag@@ gre@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ ster@@ ase treatment were light up to moder@@ ately , and rarely resulted in treatment ab@@ rup@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with the intake of A@@ generic or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects origin@@ ate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg asp@@ ir@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were classified by the investig@@ ators than in connection with the study medicine , were performed with more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and facial fat tissue , hyper@@ trophy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fatty acids . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons , which were treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , in 245 NR@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , combined with different NR@@ TI@@ s for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moder@@ ately pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resistant opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients receiving 600 mg asp@@ ir@@ ase twice daily , were kind and frequency of side effects ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception was the increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d and CP@@ K values , which were observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient can be observed on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages have been observed , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely . &quot;
&quot; for six@@ teen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , the 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r received twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure up to week 48 occurred , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be investigated . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg rite avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
&quot; based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used to assess the activity of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests clin@@ ically validated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r / rite cavi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r associated genetic samples produces a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , with which a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early canc@@ er@@ ous treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the PRO@@ 300@@ 17 study , a random@@ ized open study involving PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dose ritual avi@@ r &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ert &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis showed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in relation to the time @-@ adjusted average variable from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ cut@@ aneous threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of oo@@ ster@@ ed A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generic solution for inser@@ ting and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the majority of patients treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) that were submitted together with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimization with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the mean duration ( t@@ max ) amounts to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x lowered by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered together with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r 12 hours after dose ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to about 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can close to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar that represents the active part will probably remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredient during the dosing interval depends on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or in@@ hi@@ b@@ ate or in@@ hi@@ b@@ ate or insert a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , be given with caution when they are given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ atal exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ degra@@ dable than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generic solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dys@@ function can be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; this treatment schem@@ ata leads to am@@ pren@@ atal plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily , without simultaneous administration of rite avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r in mice and rats , hep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ omas were treated with do@@ si@@ fications , which were twice daily ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rats ) of the exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been explained and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear .

&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al removal test in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was neither mut@@ agen or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated as an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in the control as well as with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar treated animals . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic plasma ex@@ position that was significantly below ( ra@@ bb@@ its ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ generic ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day , combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dys@@ function , it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver function disorder ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;

&quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x compared to 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administ@@ ered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r and KA@@ LE@@ TRA cannot be given , however a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and reliability of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z combined with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
&quot; if this medicine is used together , caution is provided ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken , as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine
&quot; in a clinical study , in the rite avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval between 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; during the same treatment of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ generic , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcing the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered by the U@@ ter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in body weight during the follow @-@ up period . &quot;
the im@@ perman@@ ence of ag@@ gre@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient can be observed on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the aim of therapy optim@@ isation is to be taken into account with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredient during the dosing interval depends on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or in@@ hi@@ b@@ ate or in@@ hi@@ b@@ ate or insert a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , be given with caution when they are given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney dys@@ function can be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r in mice and rats , hep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ omas were used in do@@ si@@ loc@@ ations , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rats ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the development of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been explained and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear .

&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated as an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in the control as well as with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar treated animals . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that the metabolism paths are not yet fully mature , such as am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r or other critical components of the form@@ ulation ( z ) . &quot;

&quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion was neither with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inhal@@ e and low dos@@ ed rite cavi@@ ar , this combination can be avoided in these patients groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adap@@ tion for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ generic is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;

simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ory of the metabolism of this medicine and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
&quot; the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ generic , does not prevent the risk of being transferred from HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;

&quot; in H@@ äm@@ ophil@@ a patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ atom@@ as and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis are reported . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x compared to 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered . &quot;

&quot; based on the data on 54 other C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly increased plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for human beings is not known . A@@ generic solution to intake may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the Prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col contained during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tic rats , am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk . &quot;

&quot; the cream is thin on the skin surface before bed@@ time , so that it stays for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before washing . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with warts in the genital area each for 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined on 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo either a day or five times a week . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies , in total 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of warts in the genital area , the complete separation rate was 15 % to 52 % with the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ers have disappeared in the genital or perio@@ don@@ tal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption of the procedure described above should be weigh@@ ed when intensive local inflammation reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if there is an infection in the treatment area .
&quot; when follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions were only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notes it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is placed in a thin layer and cleaned in the cleaned , infected skin area , until the cream is completely covered . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a weak@@ ening between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a weak@@ ening between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily auth@@ orization is carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with one to circum@@ c@@ ision leading stri@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local r@@ ashes have been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or lead to temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty in water leaving an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly after treatment with other cut@@ aneous app@@ liqu@@ és in the genital and perio@@ don@@ tal area , there are no clinical experiences before . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicates an increased rate of inc@@ lin@@ ation reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown lower efficacy in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm to the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair approach was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made from several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed for about 12 weeks after the treatment of the treated skin .
&quot; since there are no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be taken into consideration in super@@ fixed bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experiences , so the application of previously untreated tum@@ ours is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) is a lower likelihood of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical areas outside of the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally take effect in the course of therapy , or go back after setting up the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause major dis@@ comfort or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ ö@@ tal development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one or after repeated top@@ ical application quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding period . &quot;
the most commonly reported and likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions on the site of the treatment of the co@@ wards ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
patients from 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated Bas@@ ali@@ oma patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common than likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to the side effect were a reaction at the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
the side effects caused by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; according to the test plan , the evaluation of the clinical signs showing that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often came to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , excav@@ ation / leaf@@ s ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , the assessment of the clinical signs indicates that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , severe ero@@ sions ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sc@@ or@@ estation and shortage ( 19 % ) came . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; a unique oral absorption of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of alp@@ ha@@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were demonstrated in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that efficacy in relation to a full recovery of the inc@@ lin@@ ation in a I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is significantly superior .
&quot; at 60 % of the patients treated 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the inc@@ lin@@ ation was complete ; this was at 20 % of 105 with plac@@ ebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI : &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ te , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phic AC@@ - les@@ ions within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot;
results from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of external F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ers , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fi@@ dence of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore were not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was investigated in four random@@ ised , double blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , Plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;

a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ pled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated average half @-@ value was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour@@ ly half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low in the age of 6 @-@ 12 years and compared to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fixed bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out by the mouse showed no similar effects during the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in der@@ mat@@ ogen@@ ic administration at three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ours on the application site .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption of the human skin and does not mut@@ ate , it is a risk for people to look at the systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice , treated with the fabric @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amine @-@ gly@@ c@@ ine , G@@ AG@@ s ) are not disman@@ tled and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or hospital with rest@@ orative instruments , and patients may need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , but it was also measured by its efficacy ( by examining the effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal large liver at the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ y ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat of pain , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients who may be highly sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied . &quot;
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will review all new information that may be known , check and update this summary required . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who receive al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. approval for the transport of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ sters O@@ vary ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I ) α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been identified , and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the In@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where rest@@ oring facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when applying al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience concerning the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity response has to be cau@@ tious after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before the start of the fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) , to minimize the potential inci@@ dence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or reduced in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be res@@ umed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular reception of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is possible .
&quot; experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , is recommended , while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not bre@@ ast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
&quot; adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years , are shown in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred in addition , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing still@@ s and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children of un@@ desirable drug interactions related to al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients in the age of 5 years , with predominantly severe tra@@ ce@@ ability and treatment duration up to 12 months , reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ form within 3 months after the beginning of treatment , with a severe decline in the age of 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not detected by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ r@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say , including 3 patients , with whom it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ versions . &quot;
&quot; patients with minor to low antibodies showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n , whereas in patients with high antibodies , a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n was determined . &quot;
&quot; four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a marginal or low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed to imp@@ air the clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in Har@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the inci@@ dence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ates and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzy@@ mes .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ osom@@ es , most likely by males @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ ator volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared the plac@@ ebo group to improve lung function and vi@@ ability that is shown in the following table . &quot;
&quot; the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as out of the following table . &quot;
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically non @-@ significant over this period of time and the absolute lung volume increases propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
from 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
&quot; within the first four weeks , a significant waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation among the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes in the six @-@ minute hearing , range of shoulder joint AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase @-@ 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the severe tre@@ mol@@ ding form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ ag@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group , younger patients with the mean follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form , whereas only limited or no progress in cognitive development were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations were conducted on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me @-@ dosage schem@@ ata at the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be reviewed every year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to the patients with older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated capsules and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can not be detected any special dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not yet been treated , combined with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy reg@@ im@@ en as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood picture changes , or with which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dis@@ continued or reduced the dose . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ ux s@@ lows the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
&quot; the conversion of P@@ emet@@ re@@ ux into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer term in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ esis , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease before . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease that previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin were about 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; however , in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the plate epithel@@ ium cells , with the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer than with the comparison agent . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. approval for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each diarr@@ he@@ a bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary doses is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin to the first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ cl@@ onal bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ l@@ apping plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ cl@@ onal bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ wi@@ dening of plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( K@@ OF ) is administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² K@@ OF as an in@@ fusion over a period of about 30 minutes after the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² K@@ OF is administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid can be given on day and day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ ux , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy and for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also have to receive an intra@@ mus@@ cular inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ ric dose and after every third operation cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive telem@@ etry , each patient should be created a complete blood @-@ image , including a differenti@@ ation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to 3 times of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood flow or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapeutic cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied to AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose inhibit@@ ors a hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort the inci@@ dence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical studies have no indication that patients at the age of 65 years or over compared to patients aged 65 , older than 65 years have an increased side effect . &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for the use of children under 18 years due to insufficient data on the in@@ ability and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45@@ ml / min , no dose adjustments necessary for all patients recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with liver function restri@@ ction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit ( with presence of liver metast@@ ases ) not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to bone @-@ mark@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , and P@@ emet@@ re@@ ux may not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes have reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutr@@ ality , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity as they have been observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ologic and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ a@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was be@@ ware if a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be reli@@ eved with P@@ emet@@ re@@ sted patients , foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ yl@@ actic measures to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium heart failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous taking of non ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy to avoid treatment with telem@@ etry ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy is provided with telem@@ etry , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with telem@@ edi@@ c@@ ine ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients who occurred these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ d@@ ration , pre@@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ cellular room , a drainage of the erg@@ ology should be weigh@@ ed before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ ux treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 heavy car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with telem@@ etry . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated v@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of re@@ productive ability by means of telem@@ edi@@ c@@ ine , men should be pointed out before treatment , advice regarding sperm conversion . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in a reduced occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is recommended if patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be applied to high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - and 2 days after therapy with telem@@ edi@@ c@@ ine ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as there are no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application of telem@@ edi@@ c@@ ine must be avoided at least 5 days prior to therapy , on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of telem@@ edi@@ c@@ ine in pregnant women , but as with her@@ edit@@ ary an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis may not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive ability by means of telem@@ edi@@ c@@ ine , men should be pointed out before the beginning of the treatment , advis@@ ing advis@@ ing on the sperm cell death . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ ux is transferred to breast milk , and unwanted effects on the embroi@@ dered inf@@ ant cannot be excluded . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function during the time in control arm .

&quot; it is used in over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; these enzy@@ mes are in@@ hibited , they can not cut some fats in the food , which causes around a quarter of fat fed un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg were recorded after a year , compared to 2.3 kg compared to the intake of plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study of All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients with relevant weight loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily sta@@ ins at After , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ ds ) , step @-@ out , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , exit o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , ab@@ out@@ age o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , ab@@ out@@ age o@@ ily ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be applied to patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the di@@ gestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited approval for the provision of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ ory low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , because there are not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ b@@ ated , it is necessary for older and patients with limited liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of the dosage . &quot;
• Current treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase • P@@ reg@@ n@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Current treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the likelihood of occurrence g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by an improved metabolic control , patients should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before the start of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicine against high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine needs to be adjusted .
&quot; in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) , it is recommended to meet additional pregnant @-@ related measures in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea . &quot;
both in a study on interactions of medicines and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels .
&quot; when applying War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised before bed@@ time a suppl@@ ementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin prepared to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the offering of one @-@ time do@@ sis A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time were observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentrations . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal flora and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug because the absorption of taken fat is prevented .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were measured from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a duration of 18 months up to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the inci@@ dences are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects reported after the introduction of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events were volun@@ tar@@ ily reported by a population of some size . &quot;
&quot; † It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to concerns regarding possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot;
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administ@@ ered over a period of 15 days to normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; the majority of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose cases reported after the market launch were either side @-@ side effects or similar effects , as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on human and animal studies , a rapid re@@ formation of the systemic effects that are attri@@ but@@ able to the li@@ pas@@ si@@ tic properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
&quot; in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper thin intest@@ ine , the therapeutic effect is caused by kov@@ al binding to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were derived from that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; two double blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo controlled studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 cover the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ ory , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;

&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral capsule of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , no metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two main metaboli@@ tes , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ to@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after split of the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified which displayed approximately 42 % of the total plas@@ ma@@ concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated capsules , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ ogen@@ ic potential and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can be seen no special danger to humans . &quot;

&quot; alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the regular trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional offering of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic agent ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group are not enough information .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , preventing the rec@@ ept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies in 1 842 adults , who received chemotherapy , which are strong or even trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with al@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are regular trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with al@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission announced that Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd. has granted permission to distribute Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a canc@@ er@@ ous disease and to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the efficacy of alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ struction or sign of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is provided by Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or that tend to be leng@@ th@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a further chemotherapy drug , Alo@@ xi in the days after chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hi@@ bits the activity of the five examined chemotherapy ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ Stat@@ e- Con@@ cent@@ ration of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
&quot; not before , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary to treat the doctor as necessary . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least likely to be associated with Alo@@ xi related to head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar occur@@ ren@@ ces of adverse events such as in the other dosage groups showed no dose @-@ active relationships . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective treatment for alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosing . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time period 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given to day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double blind study , 6@@ 67 patients received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , which were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are sum@@ med up in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ v. given pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous injection follows a slow elimination of plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the total dose area of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ g / kg .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean mean ( ± SD ) increase of the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentrations at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , a total ex@@ position of 0,25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to a total ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared with the same intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the use of 0,@@ 75 mg . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by kid@@ neys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies of metabolism have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enzy@@ mes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged substance made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous injection in healthy subjects , the total body weight was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces the termin@@ ale elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after exposure to be seen sufficiently above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the potential for action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose ent@@ ails in approximately the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased inci@@ dence of liver tum@@ ors , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , side ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is used for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is very low for humans . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the agency auth@@ ori@@ zes approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C , 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicine which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicine &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hep@@ atitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue has damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ anine amino @-@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are standard in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast containing a gene ( DNA ) that stimul@@ ates these to the formation of the active substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy of hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured , as many patients had a total of 48 treatment weeks , as well as 6 months after adjusting treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; this document was successfully checked as XHTML 1.0 Strict ! result : passed Address : en@@ coding : utf @-@ 8 ( detect automatically ) utf @-@ 8 ( Unicode , worldwide ) utf @-@ 16 ( Unicode , worldwide ) &quot;
&quot; in addition , concerns have been expressed , that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug could not be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar to the clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease in more patients improved again than with the reference doctor ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test conducted in the study examined the question whether the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently validated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection with skin infection ) and small infected la@@ ven@@ es ( crack or cut wounds ) , dic@@ tions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to be used for treating infections that were demon@@ stra@@ bly or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ide resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not affect this kind of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the skin surface may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
bacteria of the@@ Y@@ ers@@ ini@@ agen@@ us el@@ ic@@ it intestinal wall@@ inflamm@@ ation@@ and serious diarr@@ ho@@ eal disease as well as other afflic@@ tions in humans . this gen@@ us includes the@@ pl@@ ague path@@ ogen .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was de@@ struc@@ ted after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under Plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together in skin wounds , about 90 % of the patients were treated for treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( iron @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that were demon@@ stra@@ bly or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common adverse effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation to the job .
&quot; at the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections are conce@@ aled against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , dic@@ tions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with which no improvement within two or three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of a sensitive or severe local irrit@@ ation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment should be carefully checked and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is commen@@ ced . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for treating infections where MR@@ SA is known as a path@@ ogen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with secondary infected open wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment there is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after top@@ ical application , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After the same oral dosage of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve on de@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are insufficient regarding a statement on the birth and the f@@ ö@@ tal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to extra@@ dite a systemic antibiot@@ ic .
&quot; when deciding whether the bre@@ ast@@ feeding continued / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued , it is between the benefit of bre@@ ast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go applied , the most frequently reported adverse side effect irrit@@ ation at the administration location , which considered about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance produced by fer@@ mentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( previously Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some inf@@ ectious forms , advice should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non@@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve was applied daily under occ@@ lusion and on scre@@ ened skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma tubes were obtained . &quot;
sampling was performed on the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients prior to the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion of people according to the top@@ ical application of 1 % Sal@@ ve on 200 c@@ m2 was de@@ ported to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in trials of oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid disorders . &quot;
in @-@ vitro test on gene mut@@ ation and / or chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse ly@@ mph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were neither male nor female rats , signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , giving up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ oxin study of rats , oral dosage of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , develop@@ mental sto@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fo@@ etus and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; the propri@@ et@@ or of the auth@@ orization must ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , as shown in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for admission ( version 6.@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is mark@@ eted and as long as the sold product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the propri@@ et@@ or of permission for the transport is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance activities , as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for sector products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should simultaneously be submitted to the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report . &quot;
irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms at the treated spot are intended to end the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak to your doctor .
&quot; do not turn any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface that is treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it is not expres@@ sly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in the eyes , mouth or lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor about advice if any complaints occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the sal@@ ve , you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile association or a gaz@@ elle , unless your doctor has advised you to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is available in an aluminum tube with a plastic cap , which contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of sal@@ ve , or in an aluminum bag , which contains 0,5 g of sal@@ ve . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases which affect liver ) in children between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; ambient rix is used as part of an existing vacc@@ ine plan , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of a hep@@ atitis B infection , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ine from two doses can be brought to the end . &quot;
&quot; if a refre@@ sher dose for hep@@ atitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis A or B vacc@@ ine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by helping the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; &quot; how it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system recognizes viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ ance contains the same components as the vacc@@ ine approved since 1996 , which since 1997 approved vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used for protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administ@@ ered as part of an existing vacc@@ ine plan . &quot;
&quot; because ambient rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults , also used as a receipt for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti @-@ body concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 208 children , the efficacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
ambient energy led between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective anti @-@ antibodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of the protection of ambient rix was similar to a six and a 12 months distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vacc@@ ine cans ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , resistance ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ ance may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission announced the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. &quot;
&quot; the stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ ance consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered at the date of the choice and the second dose is administ@@ ered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refre@@ sher is required for hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ body values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a hep@@ atitis vacc@@ ine can require a refre@@ sher as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 How many inj@@ ections should be available for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the vacc@@ ine &apos;s offering of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
&quot; if a faster protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the Standardi@@ z@@ ema is recommended with the combination vacc@@ ine , which contains 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs anti @-@ H@@ Bs anti@@ body value , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ mus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ etus , these injection path@@ ways should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in the case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix however may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous , as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ mus@@ cular offering to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administ@@ ered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ ary per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with a combined massive m@@ umps @-@ tube vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective defects , there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this form@@ ulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ernal , g@@ astro@@ enter@@ i@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever compared with the frequency associated with the former thi@@ om@@ eric and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine form@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines were administ@@ ered in a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations in the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 up to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of ambient rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and accuracy on a calculation base per vacc@@ ine ambi@@ ance , but not on a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of ambient rix by 5@@ 0.7 % of subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % of the subjects after the offering of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had been given Ambi@@ ance had been vacc@@ inated over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of matrix was comparable high ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of subjects who received the Ambi@@ ance , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ernal mort@@ ality was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of the combination vacc@@ ine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ination , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to the hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6 to 11 @-@ year old age , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not pro pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ ination that reported about severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ ance or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with the combination vacc@@ ine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units formed form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials which were carried out at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , a month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the serv@@ o conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , a month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- and including 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ ance and 147 received the standard combin@@ ation@@ ing vacc@@ ine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 after offering the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ ance or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination of combination with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; for individuals who were at the time of pri@@ ming between 12 and 15 years , the per@@ sistence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ ity reaction observed in this study was comparable to the hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus , and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study at 12- and including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , the per@@ sistence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies are comparable 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme , compared to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administ@@ ered at the same time with the refre@@ sher of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ ary per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ ern @-@ m@@ umps @-@ tube vacc@@ ine , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current form@@ ulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions , like for the earlier form@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; the vacc@@ ine can be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing , to examine any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes . &quot;

&quot; the hep@@ atitis A virus is commonly transmitted by viral @-@ containing foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in poll@@ uted waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix is not fully protected from infection with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are infected with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you / your child feel not uncomfortable or feel ill / feel ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that affect liver or cause symptoms similar to hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
&quot; • If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ ance or any part of this vacc@@ ine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can express itself by ju@@ ck@@ eting skin r@@ ashes , respiratory or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the second vacc@@ ine administ@@ ered ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend three inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis A / hep@@ atitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vacc@@ ine ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
&quot; the second vacc@@ ine of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective components is usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose , and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection against the end of the vacc@@ ination series . &quot;
&quot; if you / your child is weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s own defense , or if you / your child will undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ ance can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people to vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test can be necessary to see how much the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; if your child has been vacc@@ inated or vacc@@ ine , or if you have been vacc@@ inated or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( anti@@ body ) , or if you have been vacc@@ inated or that is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient on the vacc@@ ine and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ ance , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and possible limb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ ance is to be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ines , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s pregnant or nursing women are not administ@@ ered , except it is urgent that they will be vacc@@ inated against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected cans ) : • Pain or complaints at the punc@@ ture or red@@ dening • Mat@@ ri@@ lity • head@@ aches • head@@ aches • App@@ e@@ tit@@ ular deficiency

&quot; other side effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 di@@ pped doses ) are reported : &quot;

&quot; ambi@@ ance is available in packages to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les , and in packages to 50 without need@@ les . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have been known for the initial approval for the transport , the CH@@ MP re@@ acted the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ ance , however , only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with in@@ full enzyme def@@ ective or hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high am@@ mon@@ ium concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ ia is divided into several single doses to the meals - swal@@ lowed under the food or via a g@@ astro@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) .
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as am@@ mon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ ium can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , imp@@ ot@@ ence , loss of taste or taste sensation , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the committee for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle prevents high am@@ mon@@ ia levels .
am@@ mon@@ ium was approved under exceptional circumstances because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug .
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete En@@ z@@ ema deficiency in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 days ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ folds form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first months of life ) , there is an indication of the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis there is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary enc@@ ephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered with swal@@ lowing disorders as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a occurs when the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach .
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ gestive heart failure or severe kidney failure .
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and to an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve disorders in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ectic patient , which developed a metabolic enzyme in combination with lac@@ t@@ ine dose , severe hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10@@ g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that each gram recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis early and treatment is immediately commen@@ ced to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of early @-@ mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease with the inci@@ dence of the first symptoms in new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ ectious , and the disease itself resulted in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ cky @-@ free analog@@ ues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen removal ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first months of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which had already been treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical deficits . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated with a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical deficits are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur . &quot;
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were calculated according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20@@ g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metaboli@@ tes was also examined in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ c@@ cal disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma is det@@ ectable in the next morning . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine above the kid@@ neys .
&quot; after the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no cla@@ y@@ able effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken oral ( inf@@ ants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a g@@ astro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe .
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of am@@ mon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium yl but@@ y@@ rate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat tles were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metaboli@@ tes of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , there were les@@ ions in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the brain drain . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ectic patient , which developed a metabolic enzyme in combination with lac@@ t@@ ine dose , severe hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the separation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that each gram recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; existing neuro@@ logical deficits are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spoon is 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can be dissolved before use ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzy@@ mes are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ ck@@ able waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking lab tests , you must inform the doctor that you take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other drugs , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding period , you may not take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into the breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , aband@@ on@@ ment of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ ban@@ ces and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you are aware of one of these symptoms , contact your doctor or with the emergency medical care of your hospital for the introduction of a corresponding treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; angi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( ACS , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , e.g. for instance by unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ing &quot; &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value of the electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a PCI , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , which was compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and in addition other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and asp@@ ir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or revit@@ alization ) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was in relation to all indicators as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other sh@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the committee for Human@@ medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission announced the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ re@@ inf@@ arkt ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) , in case of emergency intervention or early intervention . &quot;
the recommended initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ tion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if in a subsequent sequence a PCI is carried out , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , after clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administ@@ ered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a certain bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value is short@@ ened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight should be done . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the inci@@ dence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis is quickly administ@@ ered intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is properly administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restri@@ ction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be given and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis again . &quot;
patients with moderate kidney damage included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) that were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) was included in an average of 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated ha@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and hyper@@ tension due to mal@@ functioning of hem@@ mo@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or ir@@ reversible co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ treated patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in the case of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , most bleeding in arter@@ ial spot points may occur in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment in principle occurs everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is once again achieved prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge about the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these drugs increase the risk of blood . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly checked regularly . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies are inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tured he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have unwanted events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the Ac@@ u@@ ity and Tim@@ i measure for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ id plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an Ac@@ u@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , which required radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ om with a diameter ≥ 5 cm in the point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in spi@@ eg@@ els of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood pressure , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ ali@@ zations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients under@@ taking a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are summari@@ zed according to system organic classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should immediately break off and the patient closely monitor the signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ mbo@@ sis inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and at the Ani@@ onic @-@ region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mbo@@ sis is bound in the liquid phase or in the t@@ inn@@ acle . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly expanding the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , whereby the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , with ser@@ um of patients , in which the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ce thro@@ mbo@@ sis / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ce thro@@ mbo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) occurred , indu@@ ce a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregate reaction . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tik@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is occupied by the renewal of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was carried out , an additional bol@@ us of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated ha@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administ@@ ered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of boundary om@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
&quot; in the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were ev@@ enly distributed over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G alter@@ ations or increased cardi@@ al biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ gone a angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din as pep@@ tide has a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ valuation of amino acids in the body pool .
&quot; the primary metabolism , derived from the division of the AR@@ G@@ 3 Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which need treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm or as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or to process insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it affects faster and shorter working time than a short @-@ lived human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body can &apos;t work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may have to be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is to be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the del@@ ta or sub@@ cut@@ aneous via continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal belt . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ i@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs to be reduced in patients with a restri@@ ction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can draw a change in the insulin requirement . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or ab@@ rup@@ ture of treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ul@@ ant type of diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin , or an insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage . &quot;
&quot; the time of bu@@ oy@@ ancy of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin , and can therefore be changed when switching to the treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
&quot; these include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ etic agents such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reserves the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ flow may be weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on re@@ productive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ b@@ ated after oral use . &quot;
&quot; these are listed in clinical trials which are listed in clinical trials , group@@ ed by system organs and sorted according to the frequency of their bu@@ oy@@ ancy ( very frequently : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; &quot;

&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with in@@ hibition can be treated by an intra@@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a qualified person , or by intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after a glu@@ co@@ on injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin the effectiveness occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ a normal insulin .
&quot; in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin showed a disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has twice as fast as normal human insulin and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; from the data it was apparent that during an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ pran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ c@@ emic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ di@@ cal control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal was reached . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin is applied for 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ emic control like in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal , compared to human normal insulin , the 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , the 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin offering 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ mal@@ insulin that has been given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) before the start of the meal .
