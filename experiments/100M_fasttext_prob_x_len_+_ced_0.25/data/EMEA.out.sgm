<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for inserting (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7,5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirls thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental disorder where the patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) have alternating with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for treating moderate to severe manic episodes and for prevention of manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders, if oral intake of the medicine is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be used for inserting or the enamel tablets in patients, which are causing the swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients receiving other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells among each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is presumably the "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but lower than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role, Aripiprazol contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or mental symptoms and their recovery is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, which prevents recurrence of the symptoms, was examined in three studies by up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and Placebo which had been stabilized with Abilify, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients receiving treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in addition, the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body is resorbing the enamel tablets and the solution to absorb (absorbs)."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients showed Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased anxiety than patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition, abilify prevented the re-occurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses reduced also more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled sugars), acathemia (drowsiness), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (digestion), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the committee for humanitarian medicine (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder as well as the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly talked about the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to weigh over risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the provision of Abilify across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the Bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly used manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day every day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy of dosages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of the meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"when the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders, and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicidal risk of Aripiprazole compared to other anti-psychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be treated with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension) or hypertension (including acetic and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about during treatment with Aripiprazol occurring dyskinesia."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when in a patient with abilify patients signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur, it should be taken to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient has signs and symptoms that point to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used in patients with varicose seizures in anamnesis or conditions associated with varicose attacks."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased mortality rate compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed doses, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events associated with Aripiprazole treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events associated with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic active ingredients to allow direct comparisons.</seg>

<seg id="47">"in general, weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is recommended when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedimentation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist is Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in the case of CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the joint gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, the potential benefits outweigh potential risks for patients."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of abilify should be raised to the dose of the dose before the adjuvant therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 will be administered together with abilify with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>

<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to insufficient data storage for people and due to the concerns caused in the animal's reproduction studies, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other anti-psychotics patients should be warned against dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol does not have any negative impact on them."</seg>

<seg id="2670">"the number of patients with hepatitis C, responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar to the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after setting up the treatment with Alpheon, the disease in more patients improved again than with the reference doctor; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test conducted in the study examined the question whether the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be applied to the treatment of Impetigo (a skin infection with skin infection) and small infected lavenes (crack or cut wounds), dictions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not intended to be used for treating infections that were demonstrably or presumably caused by methicillinide resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not affect this kind of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years, the skin surface may not exceed 2% of the body surface."</seg>

<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together in skin wounds, about 90% of the patients were treated for treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, Altargo was found in the treatment of abscesses (iron-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that were demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation to the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"at the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections are concealed against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, dictions or sewn wounds."</seg>

<seg id="2686">"in the case of a sensitive or severe local irritation due to the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be canceled, the ointment should be carefully checked and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is commenced."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for treating infections where MRSA is known as a pathogen (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials with secondary infected open wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2699">"the mechanism of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50S sub-unit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances."</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, blocking partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retapamulin in at least some infectious forms, advice should be targeted by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"there were no differences in in vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes, which need treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or to process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it affects faster and shorter working time than a short-lived human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, in which the body can't work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin delivery."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may have to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is to be used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta or subcutaneous via continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal belt."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced gluconiogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs to be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can draw a change in the insulin requirement."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 A insufficient dosage or abrupture of treatment, especially in patients with a insulant type of diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin, or an insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage."</seg>
<seg id="2982">"the time of buoyancy of a hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin, and can therefore be changed when switching to the treatment schemas."</seg>
<seg id="2983">"these include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitors, dioxetine, propoxyphylate and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, under the effect of sympathetic agents such as beta blockers, Clonidin, guanethidin and reserves the symptoms of the adrenergic counterflow may be weakened or missing."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin-lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin is not absorbed in breast milk, nor is it resorbated after oral use."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"these are listed in clinical trials which are listed in clinical trials, grouped by system organs and sorted according to the frequency of their buoyancy (very frequently: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000;"</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is failed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycemia with inhibition can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a qualified person, or by intravenous injection of glucose by a doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucoon injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscle and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the effectiveness occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu- mana normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin-lulisin showed a disproportionate glucosity effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"from the data it was apparent that during an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable postprandiale glycemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"insulin lulisin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandical control than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal was reached."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"insulin-lulisin is applied for 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control like in human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- grooves before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
