&quot; the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in features , please refer to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings Expansion ... Open the map card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
this is a list of standard installation modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that if you have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you comp@@ ile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; click on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present , delete . &quot;
the overview filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras viewing filter . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; the current working directory on different types .
&quot; to use DOM tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use ex@@ tras DOM tree ... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views so that the content of your local file system can be viewed .
&quot; each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is propor@@ tionally to its size . &quot;
&quot; &amp; FS@@ View ; it reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of an folder is defined as the sum of the entries in it . therefore , it can be easily recognized if it is far below the folder hier@@ archy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UN@@ IX ; command can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ e@@ Map presentation is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or folder in your file system . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either be a depth for the light detection of the ne@@ sting depth or image of another file name such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ated rect@@ angles can be used ( with restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ e@@ Map ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; at the Tre@@ e@@ Map in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always maintained . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimum specified area for one entry on the menu entry . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the higher ordered entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ cattle .

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is available to help you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; of course , every medium and every card reader used by your operating system is supported , with &amp; digi@@ kam ; together . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; includes a fast image processing with base image processing tools . you can use these to view , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . &quot;
&quot; when you are in the program , your web browser doesn &apos;t open a page in the error reporting system . if you are using this link , your web browser doesn &apos;t open a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ kam ; website to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; if you want &amp; digi@@ kam ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to store your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the file name or click the folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add a lot of folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also be used as a library library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; thir@@ dly search the library path throughout its depth . you can &apos;t exclu@@ de sub@@ folders , unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . this can add an extra @-@ content &amp; digi@@ kam to insert a point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Old @-@ List have no photos as symbols . you can change them by using a favorite photo from the album and put this on the folder icon . for more details , see the albums section . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ kam ; your digital camera set up . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and working with raw files is described in sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is available to help you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; of course , every medium and every card reader used by your operating system is supported , with &amp; digi@@ kam ; together . &quot;
&quot; modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards , USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ photo@@ 2 program for communication with digital camera . g@@ photo@@ 2 is a free , exp@@ and@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . it allows users to transfer images of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional driver . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are outdated , this connection is outdated . &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes to &amp; digi@@ kam ; themselves . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the page edges with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drawing and laying images works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the al@@ ben@@ tree , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not included in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; the text filter will only be used for the fields used in the symbol view . this way , filtering on the file name will only work when this ind er symbol view is displayed . which fields are displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ c ; provides a organized view on your photo albums . all photos taken by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . &quot;

&quot; alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method of marking your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by sort by date .
&quot; the el@@ dest , average , new ester : these set the date on one of the oldest , the newest picture , or the passage of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first image in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ c ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in order to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; an album can only be included in a collection , and collections cannot be scra@@ ped . &quot;
&quot; you can of course use both methods to organize your photos . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window provides you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be shown in this album . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of these curtains in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album for the first time , you need to wait shortly , while the preview images are generated . this can avoid you in which you can recre@@ ate the preview images in the Extras menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be shown below the preview . what information is this , you can change the digi@@ kam settings ; click here the albums page and adjust the area preview pictures . &quot;
the thumbnail images have help buttons that appear . if you have the mouse po@@ inter a moment on a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a picture . the screen shot above in the main window shows such a help window .

&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub @-@ menu . to do this , and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs store this information from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IPTC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; two possibilities for rotation are available . the simpl@@ est way to click on the right mouse button to preview and turn off . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , you can click on preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam ; delete it , it will be moved into the ül@@ lei@@ gh of &amp; k@@ de ; if you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Ent@@ f . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My date limit ; organiz@@ es your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select dates or weeks in the date sheet below , so that only the photos of selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords have a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . Tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos that were marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; you can also re@@ arrange parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My password li@@ ste@@ er , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords will be stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking on the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keywords ; or click on an existing keyword , and then select New Key@@ word . if you cli@@ cked a new keyword after you cli@@ cked on an existing password , this keyword is the keyword of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can be only once in the tree . &quot;

&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this appears in the list below . &quot;
&quot; all elements of the database : name , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future more . &quot;
&quot; the search box is a small lamp that will find the green when searching hits . if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all images will be shown . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is performed . the results are displayed in the view My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after search again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;

&quot; the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database . each option can be added to the search group / search group . each option can be added with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ ize each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . the lower the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture in order to find a similar one . if you push a picture from somewhere on the symbol of the uncomfortable search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
&quot; sket@@ ch : hand @-@ hand @-@ sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and digi@@ kam ; find the matching images , too . &quot;
&quot; this rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can click and move it and move it . move it while you press the mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull up a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this assumes your images ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ Fol@@ der . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; produces a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The ligh@@ table from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; from the preview window , you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you what copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select quickly from a series of images . if you use pair mode navig@@ ating from the tool bar , then the two first images will automatically be displayed in the right area . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions work directly from the ligh@@ table like F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both preview images in the lumin@@ aire . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each range , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swing the visible area of the image , you need to click it and the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area . &quot;
&quot; the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom controls under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zo@@ oming into the image and beyond . this happens in both images , if you are in a preview mode . &quot;
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken , scans or digital photos will store a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure your images , use , protect and use photos . we focus on the process for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ kam . we focus on the process for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ kam . we focus on the process for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ kam . we focus on downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , re@@ group@@ ing , backup , optimize , wait and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , indi@@ scri@@ bed , categ@@ or@@ ised , sec@@ ures , seeks , trans@@ forms , pre@@ assembled , and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ adata are defined as data about data . met@@ adata are defined in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no longer to find a specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and know before you have to maintain anything in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide to have other access to your photos , whether you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network run &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times on the same place . if you do enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % working files will not be able to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend using the met@@ adata option in the site site of the met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IPTC data will be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can then select the met@@ adata from the database in the menu by selecting the corresponding item in the album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all the images that the same attribute will need and then set the value . you start the best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
&quot; if you import kat@@ alog@@ ically images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically create the tree for you , or add the images to the right place . &quot;
&quot; the graph shows how different met@@ adata can be over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data have properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach@@ gt ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dreaming of having associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you might even hear the silence . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it &apos;s the strength only with a let@@ tering for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , you can save it for a selection of images at the same time . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now running with light speed . &quot;
&quot; you can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . but you can also export k@@ ml files you can use with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export k@@ ml files you can use with Google Maps , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms apply also in all modified versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be depos@@ ited as information :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , for example to use the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to use the photographer &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; title ( syn@@ onym for summary ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publishers ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the vendor field to identify who works in the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a stock photo , here the group / agency that offers the picture here . &quot;
&quot; for private individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important for professionals and semi @-@ professionals . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the near future , such a module for batch processing is available . &quot;
&quot; topics : plate error , plate failure , power violations , ECC , transmission errors , aging of memory media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , dis@@ ast@@ er@@ aging , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which caused a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these precau@@ tions must be treated and you can no longer trust you for a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices and keep them in the right way . so the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and control sums . despite this massive protection it al@@ erts them by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; it runs under Windows and Linux ; but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged disk , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks appear to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . &quot;
do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest hardware or software that can read this media .
&quot; your manufacturer &apos;s warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . &quot;
&quot; in brief : dis@@ ks keep the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , SM@@ ART can not detect the im@@ minent failure . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also restore data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy supply and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar , but remember that not each plug @-@ in strip also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system can also be accessed . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also contain a telephone connection for your mo@@ dem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mo@@ dem and the TV pass . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an inter@@ ruption @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W UPS can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to save it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; you are compared to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . furthermore , you have to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are based on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted automatically and with large companies in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are deser@@ ters . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs make sure the data integrity between operating system and hard drive is safe .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . &quot;
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source for transmission losses because they generate inter@@ efer@@ ences within the data streams . these errors remain un@@ noticed in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems .
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate defects on low levels and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the G@@ PL compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in english . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms , and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . &quot;
&quot; open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is avoided during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while technology is further developing , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics are not far from this limit . &quot;
today &apos;s cameras are in the direction of the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and high @-@ quality op@@ tics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your border at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous as the re @-@ installation of your operating system , replacing plates or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you take your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a crowd . forget air@@ space : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbouring house , in your office or something similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files must be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of the files has been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot of two points : the complete backup and the last differenti@@ ation .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . it generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next , with the exception that it is only ab@@ orted and not ongoing . &quot;
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only duplic@@ ates the difference of files that really changed . this is done compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh . &quot;
secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or a different optical media .
&quot; at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , stored IPTC data , associated X@@ MP files , original kept , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ inv@@ enting images and met@@ adata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , viewing devices , ... , using the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so precious pictures can survive the next 40 years that is about the period of time you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while the time passes . unfortunately there is no other option than a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is available today for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means always increasing .
&quot; with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and store them onto a new record : &quot;
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang them . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no more software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is made by year by year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IPTC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF is widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( defl@@ ate ) . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DNG was developed based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using met@@ adata . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using met@@ adata . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using met@@ adata .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a labelling technology that allows users to embed their data into a file themselves . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive the original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards that support a wide range of operational purposes and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include the work on an architecture and modelling , discussion and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlighten@@ ing efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a complex editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ kam ; edit , then you should add the met@@ adata . these were cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them in web folders , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to add a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your database database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; connect these with the computer , turn the camera onto the display mode and turn it off . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display preview images . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the view are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to any entry . with the side bars properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ adata . &quot;
this dialog displays file features and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have any information available .
&quot; this information is the same as at the met@@ adata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or the image slider . note that these met@@ adata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button and then select all photos .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , download the button and then download selected . the button selected as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these pictures have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new pictures have been downloaded with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , you &apos;ll only download the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons to download or download selected videos , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums will be sorted in the section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the finish album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them by del@@ eting the button to delete all . if you want to delete only some , you must select them first and delete the selected . &quot;
&quot; note that there is no way to restore images you have deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check if the photos are successful in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; -@@ album downloaded before you delete them from the camera . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . so it can be useful , the date and time when the image has been made to integrate in the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirror image and file @-@ based sub @-@ files . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created a tag . &quot;
&quot; the options During the transfer opens three more options that will be carried out before the photos are stored on the record . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied to the IPTC data in the IPTC data . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you want another file format than the standard format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix f@@ oto@@ - % Y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S . for more adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; for a photo , is displayed below the name showing the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all the information about the camera &apos;s orientation to capture a automatic rotation during the shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section of the met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has information about the date on which the photo was made , you can create &amp; digi@@ kam ; use this to automatically download sub @-@ files in the target album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side bar Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download . select then up@@ loading . the file extension dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods select . &quot;
&quot; after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images should be loaded . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Positioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means that the data can be indicated by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European G@@ AL@@ I@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not everyone uses a plane to collect an area through automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten that , where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to document a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam ; users want to document the location of the photos , or simply want to document this aspect , it is well to store the position data of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data arrive in the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; the download of the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save these data in the g@@ p@@ x format because this is the only format that is supported by the module for ge@@ ographic mapping . &quot;
&quot; there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ related data from images and from GPS . on the following page , you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the length and latitude grade or other data , you can use this script using the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool of Phil Harvey . it uses the default characters , such as Map@@ s.@@ Google . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com will show no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that have the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . in order to access these settings , you need to change the settings dialog . you can change between them by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; when you select an image you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standard authentic@@ ation and copyright data . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for reference line : this field should include the professional designation of the photographer . this can be the name of the photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled . &quot;

&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
the default settings can be reset once again by pressing the button to the right of each category .
&quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , you can select a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can select the tool bar if you use the image editing mode in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of a picture can be marked with darker or bri@@ ghter color in the image . these colors are set here . in the image editing , this view mode can be switched on and off . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , the images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the PNG comp@@ ressing setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
click Start ! and the colors of your NEF photos will soon be re@@ activated .
&quot; when you select the loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save losses free . even if you select the loss @-@ adjusted setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . &quot;
&quot; in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , the image slider was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very quick to use a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a solid colour balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card , which was photograph@@ ed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras .
&quot; the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the sh@@ red@@ ded white in the settings . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
&quot; if you select the option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide three alternatives : bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ N@@ G inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as to how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like colour information from a color space can be translated into the other , so that the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;

&quot; the input profiles should be used to the camera manufacturers and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which contain no color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given by a device . this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors , so you could manually correct it instead of leaving your printer &apos;s blind algorithm . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious what colour profile is for them for what is fores@@ een for . unfortunately , there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; ki@@ pi is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by delivering this interface &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support , which are written to work with each program that supports the ki@@ pi interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the ki@@ pi modules , you can see a list of available modules . &quot;
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
&quot; for more information ( in English ) about ki@@ pi modules , you can get the ki@@ pi project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the ki@@ pi modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjust the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the camera characteristics show a list of all supported cameras on the left side . on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B- and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) storage cameras . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , you need to connect the camera with your computer to bring them into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can manually set camera o@@ del and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . in case you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly protected by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to apply the changes to the button . &quot;
&quot; you can also display the advertisement of the &amp; digi@@ kam ( welcome screen ) , which acceler@@ ates the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; various color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam , to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below : &quot;
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos , and to make correc@@ tions and improvement . the image editing can be started by clicking the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selecting entry / editing menu . &quot;
&quot; you can set up a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the ki@@ pi modules , you can set up in the image gallery . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar on the upper edge , including the tool bar for quick access to the most common features . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image will change your photos . however , no one of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved file saving or button saving from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should pre @-@ manufacture a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done using file stores .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by rest@@ oring the original image by rest@@ oring the original image in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have made in the photo since the last saving . &quot;
&quot; almost every action of the image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed , by selecting undo recur@@ ring or re @-@ produced by selecting rest@@ oring from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should mark the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and delete C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the return or rest@@ oring button in the tool bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also revers@@ ed and restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image up , picture down or the entries in the file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
&quot; in the photo , you can zo@@ oming in the photo and zo@@ oming in that you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the text menu . &quot;
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you can use the Es@@ c button . if you do not want this , you can change this in the setting dialog of &amp; digi@@ kam ; click on the main window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the menu file and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sentences . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and choose from the album export print wizard . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for the selected pictures . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all the special characters are allowed , which means that all special characters are allowed . the labelling is copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs . &quot;
IPTC data only support ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters .
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the lab@@ eling will be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata into the files . &quot;
&quot; it can be used with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or with keyboard short@@ cuts Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the assessment is written in the IPTC field Ur@@ gency . en@@ coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box that previously occurred in this &amp; digi@@ kam ; -@@ session addressed keywords . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering the keywords with a series of images . if you have entered various keywords , they will be saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding cross fields in the tree . all keywords of a picture are stored in the IPTC field keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not on the whole selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the section keyword @-@ filter . &quot;
&quot; the side bar of the keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search views . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and place on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount of three images . &quot;
&quot; this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off , even under the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it &apos;s one or more , you can easily change this easily with double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . &quot;
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ based workflow , the colors that are actually photograph@@ ed by your camera or sc@@ anners come with a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ based workflow you can achieve that colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or sc@@ anners , and the colors you print or publish in your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this tutorial allows you to make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . the purpose of this tutorial allows you to make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you will be able to make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six below criteria , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management . &quot;
they work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information see below )
&quot; their only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard . &quot;
&quot; if so s@@ RGB works so well and life is so simple , why should you use another color space and make thoughts about color spo@@ ilt ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see , the hu@@ ff@@ led region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colors , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms and click info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to cali@@ br@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to cali@@ br@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is cali@@ br@@ ated . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB , you need either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases .
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic compens@@ ating and contrast from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ating Automatic correction try to make the best thing out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ance values over the whole picture so that the dark@@ est dot black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without its colour satur@@ ation .
&quot; this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ osity range of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . &quot;
&quot; automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . &quot;
&quot; contrast , this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; if you are working too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction are better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym .
&quot; the preview will be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
&quot; this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your score depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in white balance . this is shown in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons Save as and loading do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set you can save this into a text file , and later load again . &quot;
&quot; the button pres@@ et settings sets all the filter values back to its standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will be added another photo as your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the code depth per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality pictures . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw pictures . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles .
&quot; this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously , so you can always adjust your settings so that you need to make use of these for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error , and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
&quot; a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provides four color effects , a solar filter effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Ne@@ on effect and a channel filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ is , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that arose when one partially developed a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect .
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and there@@ for a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers highly saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
&quot; the neon @-@ filter simul@@ ates neon light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the strength of the neon lights . in large images , the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu .
&quot; if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too great satur@@ ation . in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase them . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on sound value correction for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need only the area of the slider . concrete the three slider below the hist@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , hist@@ ogra@@ m , active channel or the selected area . &quot;
the easiest way to learn is to shift the controller and make sure the picture changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the image . on the left hand , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box , the hist@@ ogra@@ m can be set with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the medium for the light tones and the bottom for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ plates can be used in the preview of the original image , to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values , e.g. for the input values . &quot;
automatically : this button will automatically set the image values depending on the intensity values of the image .
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and re@@ loaded later . this is used to use the Gim@@ p Lev@@ els format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and solar windows . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogra@@ m for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposed indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixel and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be shown . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically , depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you shift a short piece to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , you can see that these bright sounds correspond to darker output tones , and darker shades become darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red marking . if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve you have created can be saved and loaded later . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format . &quot;
&quot; set the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the controls for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposed indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance duct . shadow and sun@@ stone was set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colour channel mixer .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position this in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m will show you the corresponding colour value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : control for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate the colour components , the image will keep the brightness even if you have the corresponding color components . try the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mono@@ chrome , the reduction of a colour is visible to a visible noise that comes from the bre@@ wing . if this is the case , you can improve your mono@@ chrome conversion by reducing the colour space first . &quot;
&quot; save as and store buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer hi@@ ring can be stored for later , then loading . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel bl@@ ender format . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposed indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixel and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction .

green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter .
&quot; orange filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( tm ) orange filter . &quot;
&quot; red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cosmic effects , and can simul@@ ate moon@@ light for day@@ time . thus , similar to the 003 Co@@ kin ( tm ) red filter . &quot;
yellow filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Co@@ kin ( tm ) yellow filters .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while he adds a bit of cold in the shades . this is very similar to the process of ext@@ inction of a pressure and the development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it &apos;s a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of magni@@ fied points or like a wall picture on a wall . &quot;
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper texture is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief is set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture . &quot;
this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , coupled with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a cris@@ p effect and decorative elements add a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : is the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this is important for the printing of pictures , especially if you have used the tool to cut the aspect ratio previously . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can paste easily a form@@ atted text into a picture in any place . this is also possible in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool sten@@ cil , you can put a template over a picture . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ kam , send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your s@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ folders with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you have copied the box files . these settings will be created for the next startup . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ folder . the selection of an folder updates the preview of the templates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button increases the underlying picture . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to shift the picture below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , three different tools are available for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
&quot; re@@ focus is probably the best of the three , since it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its application and has various parameters to adapt . &quot;
&quot; images without focus , as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera has often been applied for internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the raw format must always be shar@@ ped during processing . &quot;
&quot; if you disable this , you will get the control over your picture . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing tool . &quot;
&quot; however , you should avoid careful handling because the results do not seem very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases shar@@ p@@ ness of edges but also strengthens the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen one image can re@@ focus . you can find more information and compare all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to make soft marks with the menu entry cor@@ rig@@ ation plas@@ tici@@ zing and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview will help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . &quot;
&quot; high resolution images allow greater radi@@ ations . therefore , they should be shar@@ pen@@ ed in their final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the amount represents the percentage of the original and the wis@@ er image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of shar@@ p@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold is a rup@@ ture from the maximum RGB value and the use difference @-@ amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference with a soft change between the sounds of shar@@ pen@@ ing , and therefore blem@@ ishes in faces , skies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam , tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copyright protected removal filtering algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe . &quot;
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . the traditional technique used to shar@@ pen the image is the use of a shar@@ p@@ ness mask .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel . &quot;
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 ; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very poor . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value equal to zero , you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the addi@@ tive filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can generate good results , especially if you select large values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or the pal@@ ate . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you set will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that many operations make changes that are not visible immediately , but which later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ ks produce better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ ring a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ ks must always create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never be the effect of the shar@@ p@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
this image has been made with an an@@ alogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on methods for shar@@ p@@ ness correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; in order to create a more natural pup@@ il , the smooth@@ ness of the smooth@@ s has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ IM@@ G project .
this tool contains various pre@@ settings as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the hor@@ sem@@ en smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail @-@ keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the picture . &quot;
&quot; directional dependency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly across all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all@@ .@@ p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore , put this value to the degree of noise in your picture . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is running . normally here is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle steps &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is chosen small , it should also be small . make sure that small corners can create a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs acceptable . &quot;
&quot; integ@@ r@@ ential step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integ@@ r@@ ential step width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never exceed 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More in quality that you get through selecting this option is minimal . it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to let him out .
the buttons Save as and loading do exactly this . each setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and will be re@@ charged later .
&quot; error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button ab@@ rup@@ tly . &quot;
below you can see how image errors can be removed with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the for@@ eg@@ round that caused a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts like dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ actor ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can stay with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can be bl@@ ended with the image and the color in it will be smooth@@ ed and thus minor errors can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and noise or lubric@@ ation occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge of edge for shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it cannot remove the entire noise or noise level . put it to a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or light density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process , which is controlled by the details settings . &quot;
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or light density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically stronger , but also poll@@ uted the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ it@@ tery atten@@ uation . this value defines how quickly the adaptive Filter@@ radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , noise and phase j@@ itter may occur . &quot;
&quot; store under and loading : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how addi@@ cts can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to standard settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove the pal@@ ate &apos;s noise , film gra@@ bbing , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors resulting in digital , original or retro@@ digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture purposes . the texture is used with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ IM@@ G project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss @-@ prone compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ gt ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save as and loading do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file , and later re@@ loaded . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can see how a photo with uniform noise is restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( tm ) 700@@ si camera on an Il@@ ford ( tm ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gra@@ bbing on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old colour photo that was read with a scanner . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel images to be removed with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially when high @-@ quality raw mode photos are a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
&quot; download this file into the wizard with the dark @-@ screen button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview . &quot;
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to capture the dark picture directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in previous section , you should load the matching dark picture to the correc@@ ting picture . &quot;
the image area and preview will help you correct the result . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; duration : it is determined by an average of adjacent pixels . the resulting paint is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; cu@@ bic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cu@@ bic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cu@@ bic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel in the block . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; vi@@ gn@@ ette correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ ettes , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in the middle and large photo format , are often not able to illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ g@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ at@@ tain ) them the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise im@@ pending effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ ming and color or gray @-@ stage depth of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation to a raw image without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three reg@@ im@@ ents , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2,0 , which compens@@ ates an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or acci@@ dentally of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction dimin@@ ishes the lumin@@ ous intensity of the pixels . you have to re@@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; click the color gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second ridge treats the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ vex shape of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ der has a similar concent@@ ric effect , but flat on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ ding correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second ridge . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; in general : this value controls the strength of distortion second density . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth gra@@ des . this value affects the margins than in the middle of the picture .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads to a correction of first gra@@ ding . negative values increase while positive the picture dimin@@ ishes .
&quot; bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your picture will be saved and used for the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the barrel and cushion @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before all cutting or size changes . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then carry a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be the effect of the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal au@@ xiliary line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you have a cushion distortion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures the barrel @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives , such as shots from the front , frame and painting it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( tm ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left hand side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters setting film gra@@ dation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film gra@@ dient and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter color channels are mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter setting applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ red@@ ders .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam , filter film gra@@ ding is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers mix large silver bas@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mono@@ chrome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can cali@@ br@@ ate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam , filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect . &quot;
&quot; the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five out . thi@@ cker brush is better suited for large pictures . fl@@ atten the leaves or , from the other side , the sti@@ ff@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ete is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel is 1 and smoothing 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon bucket . the lines , which define the outline in drawing are not ideal for this effect . &quot;
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter en@@ grav@@ ings your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter en@@ grav@@ ure is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where colour is not the most important content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ olith@@ ic landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is seen by glass blocks .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ urred the image by turning the pixel to a center point . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
removing un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ urred the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to appear in the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ unt : bl@@ urred the image by horizontal movements of the pixel . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glos@@ sy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle glow . &quot;

some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a protected Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
&quot; dro@@ ple@@ t size allows the size of drops to change . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size is not automatic with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drop on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can select with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can keep the area free of rain drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free of rain . if you then start the filter rain drops , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right direction . &quot;
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to smaller is simple . the big question is , how can you boost a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zo@@ oming into an image when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you get the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ IM@@ G algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bub@@ bles was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ IM@@ G project . &quot;
&quot; you must tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the new size , and are listed below : &quot;
&quot; when entering the new size , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save as loading and loading are used exactly . each recording for photo can be saved as text file , and later re@@ loaded . &quot;
&quot; photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication .
&quot; the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . &quot;
&quot; if you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area by drawing on the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the cut , use the button &quot; &quot; The Cutting @-@ button &quot; &quot; button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will remain . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio kno@@ b the area for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings will be displayed as standard values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data is reflected in the image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the co@@ integration help allow you to hide help to make your images better together . these help are :

&quot; golden middle : the golden center is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ ti@@ lus shell or the leaf@@ s of a sunflower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used in the ancient Egyp@@ tians and Greeks , who constructed your tem@@ ples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party rule , the golden spiral produces a smooth line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s view along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equivalent tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ als on these lines can be placed more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect of professional photographers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the Horizont@@ al options reflect and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious sections .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the au@@ xiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the au@@ xiliary lines can be invisible . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture in any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy that you keep the camera exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are turned around a corner . you can manually repair this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can change the rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets , you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is shown on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the Free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ desirable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function trans@@ duc@@ ing cutting from the image slider . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the function of automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
&quot; the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . however , please note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are carried out at a point of reference to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes slightly dirty . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two customiz@@ ations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ duc@@ ing cutting from the image gallery . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to shift a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . it is no turning , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectangular will be transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; if you click on default settings , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown on the right . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line is embedded . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your picture . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the sh@@ utter , the image is caught a bit . for a single sh@@ ading , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two notes are twice as much wi@@ per and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after sh@@ ading , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove them is to cut the image with trans@@ duc@@ ing cutting from the image gallery . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to process a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependency on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them . &quot;
&quot; if the extension is listed in the list , you can view this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can change this list of the file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can find more information in the configuration section . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras will even allow you to select the format used to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression techniques on digital images . in this way , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read and convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter of &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; support the d@@ cra@@ w store , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; this is supported by more than 200 raw data formats . all support cameras can be seen below on the Web site of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format .
go forward to the previous Album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward when you have gone back .

&quot; all configured cameras are listed here . you can add the entry camera from the menu , to add a new camera to the list . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 what you can do well if the initial contrast is very good , then you can carry out the first four alignment with the white balance module . &quot;
many tools that you need for photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft signs , noise reduction , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ ring , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applies ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture .
&quot; ver@@ tically , without duplic@@ ate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area . &quot;
horizont@@ ally divide without duplic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; the upper section shows the original and the lower , compared to the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the preview window , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image , and put on the part of the image you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noticed .
&quot; the side bar features the essential information about the selected image , and is largely explained by itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections : &quot;
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photos . these data origin@@ ate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can click and move it and move it . move it while you press the mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull up a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this assumes your images ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes , and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ all@@ ets files that are being installed by &amp; k@@ de ; either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets or browse folders to files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described below the pal@@ let view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; in order to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
the color will be inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing has been selected .
&quot; a selection that was created as in the last section can be used along with the actions copy , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a new@@ line sign , if another color is followed . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of colors can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
&quot; select a color somewhere on the screen , and then find them in the color sel@@ ector on the left side . &quot;
&quot; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; project has set itself to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in graph@@ ene in &amp; kate ; the graph is re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; )
&quot; menu to open the graphs , open or graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; in one &amp; ad ; component to open &quot;
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting around 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than that node )
other required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pre@@ suppos@@ es the graph ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs .
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; without a argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen@@ shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click the first icon to view the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is bigger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph@@ ene .
&quot; if the just in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be shown : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded or whether you want to change the change . &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; you can also remember your decision later , so you can use the menu item settings k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when starting the program start , you can re@@ open all the graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are on one side , will be adapted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page preview with one on several pages , distributed graphs without header , and with another font &quot;
&quot; the Page Ref@@ resh is the option to specify the behaviour when a file has been modified on the hard disk , eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( re@@ loading or ignor@@ ing the changes ) or leave the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the page opens the way to determine the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is open from a running session . you can set a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) , or determine that each time is required . &quot;
&quot; you can set a standard behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) , or decide to be asked at each start . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears in one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens , opens additional options : &quot;
&quot; here , you can select among different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms ; the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph , are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for orient@@ ated graph@@ ene . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of oriented graphs . the algorithm sets the edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom , or from left to right ) and then tries to produce short edges and as few edge tri@@ angles as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm produces a spr@@ ing@@ ray model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ its @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ screen sa@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node circular , according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kauff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagra@@ ms of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;

this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
&quot; scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the S@@ ane project or another source , such as video streams . to this , you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed . &quot;
&quot; if you scan the menu item pictures , a dialog that will allow you to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick up the image . you can also set the source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s own image . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; note that the window is completely displayed , as some settings will not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button Scan@@ nen , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the image file &apos;s options . &quot;
screen shots can be created after you have selected in the menu Imp@@ or@@ tier@@ s- &gt; Screen image ... selected . a window appears in which you can set the various screen photo modes :
select the complete work@@ space to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if you have selected all your own program window , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , the currently visible work@@ space will be read . if you have chosen the complete work surface , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; delay determines how long screen shot will be waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above . &quot;

Flickr is an online photo sharing on the Internet . with Flickr it is possible to send photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world to display your photos of your camera and show your photos safe and private with your friends and family around the world .
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be led by the process of generating a Tok@@ ens . this will be used for your authentic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Flickr website . you will be presented the following page after a successful registration . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will display in the next section . &quot;
&quot; if the module exports to Flickr the second time , you will be gre@@ eted with the following dialog , which displays the current per@@ missions that the module displays . you will need spelling errors . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should once be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos will start on Flickr . &quot;
the keywords box can be filled with a separated list of words . these will be added to the image as keywords during the up@@ loading .
&quot; with the options open , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e you can set the access privileges to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option to select the size of the photos in front of the upload , the photos will be changed in size . the size is taken from the value of the maximum size . &quot;
maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; the ki@@ pi module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the ki@@ pi team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit the met@@ adata of an image . geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
&quot; the ki@@ pi module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alisation provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and latitude grade are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
picture Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization of Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; in order to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file . naturally , you have to load a track file with G@@ PX file . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation performs the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time , and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
&quot; the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value of this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have any trace data from one place for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog has the coordinates from a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the map can be changed manually . the map can be changed manually between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside of the ki@@ pi module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the ki@@ pi module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4@@ .01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is coded by U@@ TF @-@ 8 to allow best internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted . the rider option allows you to select all albums that are exported to HTML . you need to select all albums which are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will be saved in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; when the module is created , the window will not automatically shut down the window . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . &quot;
the ki@@ pi image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the ki@@ pi image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ om@@ om@@ es or displac@@ ements . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture will be shown in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the ki@@ pi JPEG losses free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is rising , as there is no compression of color information . this can be found in the PNG format . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module digital camera client is a tool that lets you connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the ki@@ pi module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the ki@@ pi team mailing list under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module met@@ adata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mail list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the ki@@ pi team .
&quot; with the import function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the ki@@ pi MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can select the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show . afterwards , you can start the module for ex@@ tras MPEG slide . &quot;
&quot; the images selected from you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can change sorting of the images , or the content of the list . &quot;
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to indicate a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a lower value produces very sudden , high contrast , very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should set it black . the name and path of the generated file can be set under the name of the m@@ peg output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can quickly or in all rest a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a hint appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages to the right below . &quot;
&quot; the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo size . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , make sense to print you or print with the Gim@@ p module . &quot;
&quot; this ki@@ pi module allows you to import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats , JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect the same results as the software from your camera . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w .
&quot; first select the RAW file , and start the module . the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can look at the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switch doesn &apos;t have any effect .
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
click &apos; Insert Before &apos; button and &apos; Publish button &apos; .
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ adata stored in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion . if you want to cancel this process , you can use ab@@ rup@@ tly . &quot;
&quot; the stack processing mode allows you to convert various images to once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image size or enlarge . four types of image change are provided :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ propor@@ tion@@ ate size changes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed when this option is changed .
&quot; printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo viewer . the target image , including background size , size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this ki@@ pi module , you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . &quot;
&quot; after you have started the module , the images window will appear with the images you have already chosen . you can add images to the button to add more images to the button . for the last selected image , a preview of the right @-@ hand side will be shown . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag the images to the picture list , and place it in order to add the list of images to sen@@ sing images . &quot;
&quot; with the button images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to sen@@ sing images . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window in your e @-@ mail client using the button . you have to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected by you are already attached as app@@ endix . &quot;
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send a good idea of sending a lot of pictures if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you need to install the GM@@ ail@@ Agent on your computer before . you can download this here . &quot;
&quot; after choosing comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images into a text file , and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best suited to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG under photos file format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original @-@ Ex@@ ile data will be added to sen@@ sing images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down , so you can view the status messages , on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically be started at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module &apos;s Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au window , a window appears with questions like you want to see your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation are using very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card as otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the left @-@ left corner while the presentation is displayed .
the loop makes it possible to display the presentation in a final loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c ; cancel .
&quot; the pictures random@@ ly select the images in a random order , so not the order of the images is used in the album . &quot;
&quot; the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses a different effect in each transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar on the top left of the screen . move the mouse to this corner around you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar , you can keep the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the whole number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the ki@@ pi module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail list of the ki@@ pi team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you can see your images and videos with comments , you can go with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , there are entries in each group , so in persons , places and in the group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information to look at the folder structure on your hard disk , and of course , to look at the current preview images . &quot;
&quot; if you press with the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser will change . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person only the images are shown on which both persons are to be seen . by this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of images of a few thousand images on a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view preview images to view the pictures of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but for each person you can store your own thumbnail , that is of course also for places , keywords and other categories you have defined themselves . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can select the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to specify which picture for each individual person should be displayed . in order to do this , you need to select the picture @-@ text window ( described in the picture ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can choose the image for the appropriate person . &quot;
&quot; if you visit the main window in the main window , a dialog will show you a dialog that is very similar to the setting of the image properties . this dialog can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field let@@ tering or description , the labelling or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you wish , you can also enter a date to be searched ; the date may be either part of the total data , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to specific names , as you can see in the picture . here , by pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manu@@ als , but rather want to try out the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick @-@ entry , the screen photos and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; start a few sample images and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to print this manual , you can find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline .
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the Tim@@ eline allows you to inter@@ actively use the following modes : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be shown in the preview window ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate to the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the time bar by holding the mouse button and the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , i.e. the time information . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages are created , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and goal . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the text and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the look@@ up page . n@@ avi@@ e information about export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; last , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . so you can avoid that information will be displayed , which are obvious to the viewer even without description . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . by doing so , those who use your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have set . thus , it can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; for all your HTML files , select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . you can either select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these really all are visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , started . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will run in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the just described settings are related to all three basic sub@@ folders and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name will be set in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are at a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can , of course , create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im -@@ files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing pictures will be described , which you can call the Export / Export menu . &quot;
&quot; the most important option of this dialog is , whether it is intended for internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available : &quot;
&quot; if you want to copy manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album to the Automati@@ cally close the .@@ k@@ im file ; automatically copy the images for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size limits . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image is 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... select , become &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard to import consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; in the third dialog window , you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories of the imported file will be imported , and which categories will meet these in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can use the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all images on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will get the various steps from ( 1 ) Capture the information about your images , via ( 2 ) to browse and view , to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your images . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ xml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can save with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ xml . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ xml . &quot;
&quot; about the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the various settings . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can access settings of preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by clicking on the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups . for each group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the dialog options , you can set up complete member groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group rather than all groups of a medi@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; in the left window of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window , a list of sub@@ categories is located in the left @-@ hand side of the window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called ki@@ pi and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . n@@ avi@@ e information can be found on the ki@@ pi homepage . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most of the modules have a help page you can call over the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so you should try to test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own images . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via ki@@ pi are very different , which can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that can also be used ki@@ pi is that the other applications do not support their images in albums : there is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; the current album , which is simply the current view , is a simulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so all pictures that show you the picture preview . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules are also handed over a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you use the category persons , the category you use is used and k@@ photo@@ album ; so , if you have chosen people to view it and pass this module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can browse your picture database . &quot;
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations .
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these comments , if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can always use them again , if you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images inside the list : if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can see that the names are moved up to the top of which people find and as@@ sign people faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the icon for sorting after date . &quot;
&quot; if you have any comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected pictures and have these images with comments . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you will see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can also add an entry to an existing or new category or sub@@ category . note , this assumes you just sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and move the glue , which form the top of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by pulling it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the button options ... that offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to display this window later , use the button options ... and then window a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you don &apos;t have a filter . &quot;
&quot; when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a picture , it will appear in the image viewer . if you haven &apos;t yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press the Edit button , or select the Edit menu in the Edit menu . now the window will appear you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for this problem , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use images without having to store them on the hard disk . of course you have to have the images somewhere , that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support it until now . if you would like to avoid the inser@@ ting of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , then filter the images that you want to see for others and click on the latest view in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the images that your little sister may see , and select the menu item everything except the current view . &quot;
&quot; if you want to lock the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry , so that all images you want to be locked will be hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the Privacy Settings . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this picture protection is not very safe . for example , all the pictures on the hard drive and the other one can read or delete the password as un@@ encryp@@ ted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to indul@@ ge in the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you have all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it , of course , that you want to look at them some@@ time . this is why &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . this can be done from the preview , as described . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in it . of course , it shows the image , but additional information you have in the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can also configure it with the mouse , and you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can change between them and move back by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as a slide . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete seat on the screen . simply use the input button to switch back into full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; if you can use the viewer , you can move into the picture and zo@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn up . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work in videos that are in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the shooting functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments about the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures , it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image . in the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to view this name . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and select them as good or bad as you can see one after another . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with characteristics , while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so you can see all the images you have to edit , print , or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and particularly features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can display categories in dre preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; to work , you must not fully master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position in which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are m@@ box possible positions , the following drop down menu will be displayed in order to select the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click on users to take these changes . have you given invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to ren@@ ders a part of the texture , even if you want to ren@@ ders a part of texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , you cross locally . &quot;
&quot; the screen shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera . &quot;
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the controls disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can only indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected , or the visibility level of the scene defined in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; has a window code as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left , and the four graphical views on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need another configuration , you can adjust it as you can . you can also store multiple window orders and simply change between different directions . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window or under an existing view , drag the beginning water to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the Beg@@ inner to another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map card field in the view . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window rules are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the beginning water to the desktop or click on the little left @-@ pointing arrow in the base strip . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the fas@@ cia bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can paste additional views into the main window . in the view view , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place . &quot;
&quot; the current window view , you can save with view window order ... save . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dern them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . &quot;
&quot; in order to ren@@ ew the current scene , click the icon Ren@@ dering the icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of the rendering . if you want to ren@@ ew a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can paste many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The render settings in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , meaning it is a name that lets you recognize the attributes of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ ew only a small area of the image , select the cross section and enter the picture section for rendering in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality , you can select the properties that use &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user &apos;s manual on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; if you switch off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is a adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling the adjacent pixels will be split up and adap@@ tively because each pixel depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; when you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixels will be handled with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two Pix@@ els is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
Di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between color values exceeds the threshold threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be followed individually and checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the Ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch off J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern . &quot;
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflex@@ ion is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this card board , you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent when the associated rays have no object . &quot;
&quot; open a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; con@@ soles edition . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; not the full command scope of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if errors or warnings occur when import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; import , write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds to the source text of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the help in the property view , click &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User documentation for the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type mark .
&quot; you can set the object item on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set up the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level for two directions separately . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera is using an extended projection . this feature gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dern . &quot;
&quot; if you display a wall , a wall behind the objects is framed . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the floor , a floor underneath the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you check out edge smoothing , non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . &quot;
the combination field standard window arrangement : displays all existing window direc@@ tories . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
&quot; the list Vor@@ gruppe window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created using the button add , and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove . &quot;
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
&quot; the list under the name displays all the views for the chosen window order . new views can be created with the button add , and delete selected views with the button Remove . &quot;
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window below the window , with the map card you will find a map card view together with the previous view and Schw@@ eb@@ urn the view is not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just started &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start with any more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings , before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t insert a light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed anything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ re@@ model@@ er ; the following window configuration : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will often have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera can change the camera in view with which you can change the camera &apos;s target point . simply click on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button user or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change accordingly . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could paste a fa@@ der ( insert final body qu@@ ad ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an easy way to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the user or the input key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case you will only see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will only see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will only see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will only see the different parameters of the object . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should shift the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , so that you can get to know some of these parameters . &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can choose how the object should be inserted . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , as the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment shows only a matt black material , because you have to make adjustments to the pig@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on qu@@ ad and ball in the preview , just click on the user button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you ren@@ ders your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , that is not the color you expect . here are more settings . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select the colors in the view of the object characteristics : &quot;
&quot; you should already be able to run this step , as you should have the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; already understood . the ball is just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget the input button or button to press users ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor as you moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering is a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball you can as@@ sign a material now . as already on the floor , give the ball a pig@@ ment as a color : &quot;
&quot; first sub@@ property and change the name for example in the Pig@@ ment sphere . click on the Pig@@ ment , then select Solid Color and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish features : &quot;
&quot; then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots , and click on users or press the input key . &quot;
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces even when metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that depic@@ ts the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will have nothing to see without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source , you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
open a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest record in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have saved the model already , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a storage place . &quot;
the scene in the last saved version will rest@@ art . all changes have been disc@@ arded since the last storage .
&quot; this menu entry , you can only select if you don &apos;t have any stored changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeat the last undo command . you can only select this menu entry , if you have used undo . &quot;
stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance of the key and the default behavior . &quot;
open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to use rough surfaces without modi@@ fying any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump Map as well as a texture map .
&quot; basic elements are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these bas@@ ements . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis , using a image file as a color card . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can choose pictures to display . &quot;
images can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple .
&quot; you can set whether each image is to be displayed in a window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c ; &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue set @-@ up - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can see below . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still view the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; click the color bar to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; establish that only some of the file types are displayed which can also display the program .
this option is enabled for large images to be enlarged on the full screen . this option is enabled as default .
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change here the key for the different modes of operation and ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the card cards for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ piece view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
show large icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short @-@ term viewing .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short @-@ term viewing .
show preview images for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short @-@ term viewing .
reduced the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic scale is activated .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&quot; * First of all , your product is fantas@@ it@@ c . I looked at the others and your code generator app was ins@@ an@@ ely easy to use . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to look at your photos , correc@@ tions and modifications . &quot;
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photograph ; an open source project . this means that the user will contribute to its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are also in the program , your browser doesn &apos;t open a page to reports of problems and wishes . if you use this , your browser opens a page to reports of problems and wishes . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photograph ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a more frequent user of &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot , then we would like to send you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photograph ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photograph ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; try to give as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behaviour of &amp; show@@ photograph ; you need to change the settings in the Settings show@@ photo ; you can change between them by pressing on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the sub or over@@ exposure indicator was selected .
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photograph ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; c@@ utter@@ lite ; is a simple application to scan and store images , which are no longer able to scan and store images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the information on this page : http : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; chan@@ lite ; with the command c@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog will be opened to select the scanner . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner , and press OK to open the scanner . break off &amp; sh@@ uff@@ lite ; exit . &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; channel lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ an ) these options do not treat these options .
&quot; in order to capture a picture , the user can only start a preview window and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button will be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zo@@ oming into the image and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and drag it back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the same dialog box will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the kind of &amp; channel lite ; to select images . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each image sc@@ anned image . if &amp; chan@@ lite ; this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select saving without a file name . &quot;
&quot; the default value is your home directory , and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a image pre@@ fix for the automatically @-@ saving images and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved picture gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality to store . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
&quot; the Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Channel lite ; manual . the button about start the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; chan@@ lite ; the button settings will show the dialog for the settings and closing it can be used to end &amp; chan@@ lite . &quot;

&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; use like all other programs button short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and function . you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and function . &quot;
you can set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; short commands . this makes your keyboard to the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center .
&quot; this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback , if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency . please check in your script if all the modules are available and use the dialog so that the user knows why a script is not running . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ruby ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts , or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts are relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ ok and manage Amar@@ ok . the simpl@@ est way is to use the command D@@ CO@@ P ; , which each K@@ DE installation should be enclosed . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow the output of external programs and commands . in this way , D@@ CO@@ P &gt; can be called &quot; &quot; ex@@ ec ( ) . this way , D@@ CO@@ P &gt; is relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings should monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script may also ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure script to display the setup dialog . in order to store and store the setup data each script itself needs to take care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is played . the script could now be read &amp; z@@ b ; using D@@ CO@@ P functions for further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , send &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script pack@@ ets that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will accept only script pack@@ ets with the development amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script pack@@ ets right . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest of the load@@ able modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and hang the link to the wiki scripts page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; hang on . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the category am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts . &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features , and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you can simply drag music to the play@@ list instead of having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; it &apos;s collecting browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select dynamic mode and intelligent play@@ lists automatically adjust the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to type in the basic sub@@ folders of the Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report this in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , like most applications , you can activate or disable the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you should use full use . &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without difficulty passing the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , only the play@@ list window is displayed . &quot;
&quot; this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the option switches to the experimental function of the vocal bar@@ omet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; design : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the color scheme for the mood barometer is changed . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored on the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; otherwise the .@@ mood file will be stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;

&quot; save play@@ list when saving , saves the current play@@ list automatically when sending &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; . enable this option if you want to lose the current play@@ list in the end . &quot;
&quot; if you activate this setting , use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of play@@ list , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved . &quot;
&quot; in order to keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece of items , the play@@ list window will be opened / off to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context browser , you automatically change the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the App@@ ear@@ ance section , you can custom@@ ize &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s appearance . the section is part of three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can choose fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ list window , player window and context browser . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the Qu@@ al of Choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; after the start , play@@ back starts playing automatically with the piece on the spot where it was stopped at the last time . &quot;
&quot; set the O@@ SD screen on screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click on the button to select the font for the O@@ SD . the cross @-@ field shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors , you will be able to custom@@ ize the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog to color selection . if your own colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used . &quot;
the input field display text is displayed in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you can find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users .
the card board audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers still enable other settings in this card board .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the Fol@@ der , the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; both the cross @-@ crossed and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folder to changes ( eg if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; import play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ list browser . &quot;
&quot; the part of the collection database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup window . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup is used to set the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; it uses : if the machine is entered , the database is entered in which the database is available . name : is the database name where the connection is established . &quot;
&quot; use username : password : to enter the data , which is needed for connection to the database . &quot;

&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you need some of them to find modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pre@@ suppos@@ es that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . so we try to support am@@ aro@@ k on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can check the file by viewing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection / apps / am@@ aro@@
&quot; mostly , this is because Tag@@ lib is going to read the meta information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b Developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is somewhat mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version were compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this leads to crashes when editing the Meta information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , turn off auto . switch off if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via email ( the email opens automatically with a crash ) . if it &apos;s a common crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the meta @-@ information , but these are not known as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error when writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PAN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map , then check if am@@ aro@@ k uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any colli@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf that am@@ aro@@ k will find the right version first . &quot;
&quot; there are some ways . most inst@@ aller issues are the easiest by using an expert , your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and IRC at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
bug@@ zilla is not suitable for help . please use only one mistake if you are looking for a bug in am@@ aro@@ k itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; only a blank play@@ list appears . how do music pieces come in ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ up window was converted into the statistics window . you can find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically . &quot;
&quot; to rate pieces , the review column must be shown in the play@@ list . click on the title list of the play@@ list and select column shows . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press down on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your choice and then choose from play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would like to do with other files . &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right next to the add button , you can store the play@@ list . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably missing the program x@@ mms @-@ config . install the package x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it on the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used by a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question of which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support this rather every concei@@ vable audio format . g@@ stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which is not included in the default setting ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . &quot;
&quot; for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another type ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
g@@ stre@@ amer is the best choice when you &apos;re looking for a de@@ coder with little overhead . g@@ stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a de@@ coder with little overhead . g@@ stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a de@@ coder with little overhead . g@@ stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a de@@ coder with little overhead . g@@ stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a de@@ coder with little overhead . g@@ stre@@ amer is de@@ coded and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ code the data first . g@@ stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed play@@ back . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the arts buffer in control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help you can also ask in the IRC channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( end am@@ aro@@ k before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then follow the register register , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . delete it in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with the @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the list register again . start &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &quot;
please report this under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes please send them the best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm of this command : D@@ CO@@ P am@@ aro@@ k player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will wake up from the gentle sounds of music you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the currently in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; current titles if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current unit : s@@ sh -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP D@@ CO@@ P --@@ user ih@@ re@@ IP name am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ playing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
&quot; the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; window will be separated . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in size . &quot;
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece into the queu@@ e . by pressing the input key to a search in the play@@ list the first search is played and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ eted features , but how does it look like in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; in the context menu , you can select which browser should be displayed . &quot;
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HOME is on a NFS drive . after the start of am@@ aro@@ K the collection database cannot be created and on the console many error messages appear . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need to use ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k on a local drive or use Amar@@ ok &apos;s MySQL support .
&quot; for automatic codes , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE url = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escape e@@ String ( url ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less impact has every single rating on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can click the rating for a piece yourself by clicking on a column heading in the play@@ list window . then you can change the rating of a piece just like all other attributes , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and edit : select rating or press F@@ 2 . you can edit the evaluation in the met@@ adata dialog . &quot;
&quot; the developers don &apos;t want you to introduce you when you should publish a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set publishing plan of not to bring together with the short @-@ term plan of am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
&quot; this is a new function in am@@ aro@@ k , which some users can find ner@@ vi@@ g . un@@ check the option icon for playing in general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings Tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create a own . install this then under am@@ aro@@ k ... App@@ ear@@ ance context browser design , click on New Design ... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ ors Navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; while you brow@@ sen in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation area . then click the button settings ( top ) and select in the drop down menu . &quot;
audio cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; supported .
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please check the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; probably , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the / configure routine does not comp@@ ile these output modules . &quot;
&quot; now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new installed , but the output modules are still not yet . and now ? &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled using a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the D@@ CO@@ P command line or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so it is more likely to make your taste and the kind of tasks you want to give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the D@@ CO@@ P command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then just type something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
&quot; * First of all , your product is fantas@@ it@@ c . I looked at the others and your code generator app was ins@@ an@@ ely easy to use . &quot;
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project using the # D@@ CO@@ P k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference , it is possible to modify the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void ad@@ dur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then add files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( D@@ CO@@ P k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) D@@ CO@@ P $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o D@@ CO@@ P $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o D@@ CO@@ P $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read@@ out for &amp; k@@ de ; . with him , very simple audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many en@@ coding , which en@@ coding these WAV files ( compression ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the machine ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ resses in the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format , or in other formats like the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ ver , Audio Quality and Com@@ pression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not provided for any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting only once ( the setup dialog has been found so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you can often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which code@@ c programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet , or can work completely without network , whereby everything is collected manually . &quot;
&quot; this is only a short list of the main window commands . on the page step for example , you can find further information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB starts with the CD data according to the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . ) &quot;
&quot; start reading and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the Settings tab in the setup directory , en@@ coding . &quot;
&quot; open a sub @-@ menu with a list of the available en@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the standard . it is important to note that the en@@ coder is configured in the code settings dialog in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; open the file manager , so that an already viewed file is chosen instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and coding . &quot;
&quot; open the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; open the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various card cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set the en@@ co@@ ders ) . you must go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co @-@ di@@ ver and compression ratios and helps you choose the right en@@ coding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; Sh@@ ape &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important since both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ devices is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these devices usually only support MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good pleasure for music of young , portable devices and car @-@ stere@@ o@@ ilers . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting is over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that manually entered or fet@@ ched from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the coding program to create folder and file names and the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the code@@ c and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the en@@ coding will explain the switch to these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people read the audio CDs that can download / enter information , so all other information can be downloaded instead of the computer : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( referring to the translator : this is the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address will not be used to retri@@ eve the data from the server ( This can only know the programm@@ ers who have checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographic is to be used by the closest mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the computers . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more accurately , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package should be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; in the first open are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free comp@@ ressing for audio data ) on the tab card to set up the coding . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined co@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ver are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
&quot; after installing a coding , more information about his switch can be obtained by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reader feedback and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio code@@ ers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step for example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , but somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . however , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write texts on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) .
&quot; the first section treats the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something which is probably just done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which needs to be repeated for any out@@ going &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; here we determine the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . as we are lazy , we share the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at any reading of a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is transferred to the read@@ out program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk . if this does not work , or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card card General Settings . here is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is displayed as shown in the screen shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , you will be informed if data for generating keywords ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
&quot; note : the computer must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; to be connected to the internet , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot;
&quot; the second selection box is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily change . the directory / fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with con@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter anything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode when you download the database before . however , this is more than 620 MB large , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in the offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server on the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and watch them according to a mirror server . on this way the load will be distributed between the machines . however this option will work first .
&quot; both functions iden@@ tically to the server , since many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 default , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , since the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transfer data to fre@@ ed@@ b servers . &quot;
simply take the settings of the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
&quot; at the same time , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author knows not , therefore , simply try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances , something must be left to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned previously , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ cting the generation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in the event of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of WAV files simultaneously : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is , we just have the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; termin@@ ated . this configuration is used as standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described and set up in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; because we use a &amp; CD ; use the screen@@ shots a little differently than the data for a &amp; CD ; with successfully retri@@ eved data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , then search for questions and answers to the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be shown . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; you can select a window , and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best for your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first unit
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo , the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Update Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must no longer be given to the input field &apos; Update Title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v1 tags . this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment section . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the files generated later with the tag editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
Tags are not supported by all en@@ coding or file formats . see in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that obviously agrees with the style of the ending CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are found under Rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply type the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
&quot; click on the next line in the main window , and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title details of the &amp; CD . &quot;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . just the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line will switch off the selection of the piece . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the button on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection , read the read@@ out process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is read straight to the hard disk . the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a code@@ c you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the job list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered in the sample . do you have checked whether you have read access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of unit 1 into the format MP3 . so you can read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it &apos;s now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code .
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is coded and a third order is en@@ coded in the queu@@ e &apos;s queu@@ e . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code@@ c of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at individuals who comp@@ ile from source files , and not for users that use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you search for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants . the best way to read the step by step , for example , to learn the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the various card cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still am reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any c@@ lue as it should go on from this somehow blank screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; if you read this , you probably already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as a first version for a manual for &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended as a first version for a manual &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator . if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange , if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke player of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ ao@@ ke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of lyrics also some features that other &amp; UN@@ IX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so that it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
&quot; supports both existing standards , to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with its help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; windows fall into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playing in the tool@@ bar , select the entry of playing from the menu piece or press the space button . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece starts automatically when you click it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played down one another . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is played , you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and change the speed . to return the original tempo again , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar will act as a pressure on the button pause or the entry of the menu entry break in the menu , then inter@@ rup@@ ts play@@ back . press the space bar while no piece starts , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; play@@ back . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two kinds in a piece of music . some pieces use text events , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what kind of events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically calculated that one song is used , so you do not have to adjust anything manually . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select the entries text events or song events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summari@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , you first open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the dot organiz@@ er .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
&quot; you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy , then select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original . &quot;
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set up the winning manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , you must add a song to the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the button add a song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is activated , a piece is added when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when an automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and logged in when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the open pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series to select collections from the sub@@ menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or choose random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the next song , next song from the menu piece or press the arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to rever@@ t a song back to a song , select the previous piece , the record previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving . &quot;
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events which the synthes@@ izer understands .
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to tr@@ ump and thus always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ WE - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so , you need to edit the corresponding file ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file , which stores all the requirements for playing a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear as often as desired . prer@@ equis@@ ite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TIONS ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that DE@@ F@@ INE is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
&quot; in this section , the patches from General MIDI can be shown on your specific keyboard . general use looks like this : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 tools . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a rifle shot . &quot;
&quot; if the MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( rifle shooting ) , patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch , each note represents another perc@@ us@@ sionist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; like the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as their presence . so , you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel . check out the supplied key@@ maps as an example .
&quot; this section may be used to map some channels to others . if you want to s@@ wap the first and the second channel , make it easy for the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following samples : &quot;
&quot; if you use the KE@@ Y@@ MAP option , the KE@@ Y@@ MAP needs to be defined in the file name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied with the value n , this is converted to the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then it is only forwar@@ ded . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al comments are available ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM anticip@@ ates that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 , is to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards are trying to play two tones up to an oc@@ ta@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t shine green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
&quot; the channel view has two different views , in order to display the played sounds . &quot;
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which one song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , a song is too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . this allows the same MIDI file to be played on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file requires about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file requires a similar sound quality . in addition to a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; it &apos;s home ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole file to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before , activate the setting automatic add to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key to the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down play@@ back . to restore the standard tempo , you can double click the LCD . &quot;
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; working area a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) or to play a file only in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you only want to listen quickly to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly that one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ zur ; lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the university of Ma@@ acute ; lag@@ a . at the moment I am in the third year so that I do not have much leisure time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / Kar@@ ao@@ ke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or an MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ ao@@ ke file from a local group , I &apos;ll send you a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to send a MIDI file , you should contact me because I might already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time , and don &apos;t get money from anybody . I &apos;d like to stress that I only get more programs because / when I receive feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at A@@ WE cards was too high .
&quot; thanks to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ aci@@ o Gar@@ cia for testing the A@@ WE support , he Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ru@@ ch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a fault notification or just a supp@@ or@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks to all these excellent musicians in the network , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also on its homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . on the homepage you can watch the development , search information and view images . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ ao@@ ke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM device or an A@@ WE card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you need to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL you will be able to comp@@ ile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . &quot;

&quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as play@@ back DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is the window with the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category of permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ archy level . if you anc@@ lub one entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and play@@ back starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / can be modified by an editor , but also by using themselves . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu must be selected with play@@ list and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author &apos;s &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be enabled by modi@@ fying XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation on start and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily . &quot;
it is also possible to enable other animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ xml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ xml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at the start doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing at the end animation , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ ty ; &amp; lt ; img = &quot; &quot; meet &quot; &quot; ; &amp; lt ; in the directory testing / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &quot;
&quot; there is a rider to configure M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here , the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no rider for this play@@ field in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ zilla : &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; in order to restore the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assign@@ ments of K@@ DE will be specified . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is in a con@@ soles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser Module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; this is always a given back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime type ( of course only if it has been detected ) , this must be done by manual change of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be played by TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . &quot;
&quot; to configure V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ ilt - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port should be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; as the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( pres@@ um@@ ably this kind of play@@ back of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ linux extension must be functional in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internal are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ version , pi@@ pes@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ Scanner , TV@@ Source , url@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ ex@@ source . when activated , they start playing the play@@ list . &quot;
is there any hints how I can do my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is used as user root after connecting the device . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why must each time be checked on their performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is outdated , k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users don &apos;t need to read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation are taken into consideration . if the support for this project or its documentation is required , contact the k@@ ile ; website should be made . &quot;
&quot; questions about or when comp@@ iling a &amp; k@@ ile ; or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;

the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ n ) offers some possibilities for creating the document .

new users don &apos;t need to worry about it . it is only a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source text editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generated a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings , set up ... La@@ TeX commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are normally sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allow the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ class sub@@ section ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; file search can be very helpful , as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; straight file &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer at the appropriate line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the common output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and print out DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when you use the return search , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; source text has been cli@@ cked , is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project settings . &quot;
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no errors in source code exist ) .
&quot; file overview : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file will be installed on obsol@@ ete inputs and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick installation . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection fields should be tra@@ cked . the selection fields were developed for quick integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The for@@ ce@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field For further information about items such as keywords , joints or references . the adjustable possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;

&quot; the last selection field with the name of the text model is used for determining the font size . the font sizes can be set for the main text , the joints , etc . , the following font sizes are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and selecting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; once the above source text example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is the use of the Men@@ Ã ¼ s building or the Kn@@ op@@ fs Schnell@@ bau . &quot;
the source code must be saved before the comp@@ iling .
&quot; if the document fails to comp@@ ile the document , it should be searched for errors . when using a quick assembly , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be ignored . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( in the environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report is created with the font size 12 , and only a few words should have another font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ rig and \ \ end { environment } , then the initi@@ ation of the font sizes in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , offensive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the intensive pressure and is as long as possible until it is closed with a \ \ end { ou@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented with \ \ pl@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .

&quot; as soon as the wizard has been given a little text , a few adjustments should be performed for the better read@@ ability of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document was viewed , Editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the Editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on a DVI , the document can be printed in the viewer ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been created , the conversion can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;

&quot; the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a row of the source code and cli@@ cked on , and the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is then made . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ document by &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as a text editor ( setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; if an error is available , it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the logging file stops the source code in the source code . in the editor you can see the errors in the source code . in order to view the error message , the logging file must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the wrong line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the corresponding button is cli@@ cked in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . &quot;
&quot; when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written or the assistant to quickly create a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; when you click on &quot; &quot; Request Password &quot; , &quot; you &apos;ll be sent an e @-@ mail with instructions how to set up a new password . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be opened or created a new file . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character en@@ coding ) . these variables can be set in Settings K@@ ile ... Settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wizard , and that is associated with the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have been completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default setting . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . if a simple way to create a template , it should be searched for one on the internet and will be carried out under the following steps . &quot;

this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to locate the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is in front or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , jump to the end of the surroundings ( or vice versa ) . &quot;

&quot; it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) , and therefore German or French suits . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
the current line with \ \ \ \ with an incoming line break .

&quot; some users want to connect the columns in tables environments , and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already has a good source code completion , this was added to &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to set up special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) there are three different modes of operation . all these modes can be set for different working modes under Settings ile ... &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and allows the full list of users . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . you can create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs , such as &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day@@ time signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . for each day , use different signatures , such as in random signatures , create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; in order to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you an lt ; empty signatures ; in the section Sig@@ natur@@ en . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you can . then , you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you use e @-@ mails private or professionally , there are always sufficient signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it in the file , or click the icon with the red cross removal in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; open the short commands dialog . here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click on the user &apos;s button and enter the new short command by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; for the use of &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach Sig@@ natur@@ en to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can add the signatures from the issue of a command . &quot;

&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML , tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools are used as a surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination provides fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it a bit , we &apos;ll give it a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the ge@@ dar@@ ed working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time when mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful it is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now there is a great graphic interface . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply leave the current working folder . if not , then choose the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is def@@ ective . please check the reported bugs and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if not , delete it to the current file , and select the file to check the file using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed verification selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; in the &amp; XML file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; application tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file as the result is to be named , the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you may benefit from the additional functionality and don &apos;t have to wait until someone builds the gun in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . more information can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we begin with the menu plug @-@ ins . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows all the plugins to manage and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ ins .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the number of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves as a unique identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can look out of the list of the team members who he is . this is happening by searching the team member from the list and press the S@@ etting button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears bold after you are : text .
&quot; nickname : ( is displayed on the page , if no entry appears &quot; &quot; an@@ onym &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leader if something is happening . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific is happening in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone is working , or a script that plays a file into the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the site Event Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an E@@ Mail will be sent to the add@@ res@@ list selected in the recipients list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see , if such a ladder is set up . &quot;
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
&quot; note is simple . it can either be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ otation keyword in a comment section , followed by note text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , where the nickname of the set name of the team member is , the role played in the project . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roles names are independent of major or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting languages , the D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic is supported and supported web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are available via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over some pages that are dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; in case you don &apos;t have access to extended information such as sound samples despite logging on as a member , make sure your security level is not too high . &quot;
&quot; in case you don &apos;t have access to extended information such as sound samples despite logging on as a member , make sure your security level is not too high . &quot;
&quot; optional tags : if sh@@ aved , tags for tags , for which the closing date is optional , this is immediately after &amp; quot ; added . &quot;
no optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
&quot; automatically update start and end date : when enabled , the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding en@@ coding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files .
standard drawing coding : en@@ coding of newly created or in other ways as with file opened opened files ( where the en@@ coding of the file can be over@@ loaded ) .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD has not been recognized . however , this setting is eliminated from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that it can restore the document from this backup at the next startup of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . it is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be shown either in the editing area or one &apos;s own view ( or documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and source text simultaneously . &quot;
set the default window settings to the standard back to the next start is useful when the user interface comes through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ etting layout command line parameters .
the warning messages area serves the control of the possibility to disable warnings by hook of no longer .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text display in shared mode .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the image of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structure tree settings , the visibility of node in the tree , the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty spaces are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such that are not found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be used for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means , there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ clause ab@@ brevi@@ ation is something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications of third side , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plugin when starting , so it can open up the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to store the load when this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . select the entry also if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting is completely new . the support for the no longer needed built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented , which allows different implementation of plugins . &quot;
currently only one plugin is available to support the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add .
&quot; the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a matching de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the options beside the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or a part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , is made , or it divi@@ des the plugin to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ger requests . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which is used by a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that the normal case must not be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this request is shown in the de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
&quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens while the script is stopped , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next , as if there would not be the current . &quot;
&quot; open a dialogue in which a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the vari@@ abl@@ en@@ view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which she can find at http : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works by Keith . &quot;
this chapter describes how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better .
&quot; document Type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages , as well as &amp; CSS ; to give &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ability to use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and content of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool tracks enable a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without danger of a writing error . &quot;
tag folders are nothing as a folder . they only contain the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders include the names of the address language and version . ( for example html @-@ 4@@ .01 @-@ strict )
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the day XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be laid in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only be found in a document . it can only contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type over itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only for the class class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only for the type method . specify the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
it defines the name and type of attribute . it defines the name and type of attribute . additionally it contains further tags describing how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc . this is a only element type element .
&quot; returns the source code for the attributes in tag editor dialog , and attribute tree &quot;
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source of data .
&quot; source = D@@ CO@@ P , an interface and a method name . the arguments that are passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
&quot; this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example , for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty . &quot;
&quot; returns the position and size of a field in dialog . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty . &quot;
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ able tags . this element is a one @-@ element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a one @-@ element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check for Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the review only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
&quot; in the following example , for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file is to be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following example , an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is supposed to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor to be re@@ achable via D@@ TD Bear@@ d D@@ TD settings . thus di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&quot; &#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4@@ .01 transitional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4@@ .01 Transitional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
an action can be set to create actions ... click on New Action to the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cuts this action . with clicking the user &apos;s button , button short@@ cuts can be added ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard short@@ ening can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est actions . there can be a text in the det@@ ai@@ ed settings and in execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications can be started ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use the document ( or parts of the document ) , to be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . &quot;
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is applied to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus may be used ; in the input field , input can be determined , which is to be sent to the standard input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types issue : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , which should be written to the standard output , by setting the selection field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . &quot;
&quot; once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window to start editing mode .
&quot; for this reason , please search for your company name with the function below . when no listing is found , you can choose to make a new listing . &quot;
&quot; complete all and if the day attributes has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; &quot; edit tag &quot; &quot; if available so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field , you press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the user button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to complete some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for the tool@@ bar , or it should be shared for a better overview by some cutting into several groups . make sure the desired tool bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want to add a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the Tren@@ ner does not know the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by testing all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; once new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is open from the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most important extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language you like . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as : &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
note the # before getting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of chess ( except reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and more consistent at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files are replaced . &quot;
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now , you can easily store your file doc@@ r@@ c to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you indicated in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that this well and it is worth to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the waste resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else who are sent . at different places , there is an Email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool @-@ like tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can search for a new resource . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can upload from the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool@@ bars , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before the installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource through checking the integrity and signatures . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the specification of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is supported to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . however , it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files may be needed in everyday XML format . there is the simpler way to automatically convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started by D@@ TD loading and converting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD Description that should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p file .
&quot; * I downloaded your free version to see if I could get it to work with my website , and I am almost there ( I have been looking for something like this for ages ) .. &quot;
&quot; setting the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , bring &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion to the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand this and to take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are stored for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use , available . from tool tracks about actions is everything that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements are a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ bri@@ des the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editing window , the tree views , the card holders with information and the tool@@ bar . please note , and for further information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the card pioneer with the right mouse button to obtain a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all cart@@ els , rest@@ art , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; rect@@ angle in the editor area will lead to another context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the file under the mouse po@@ inter or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editing window , the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4@@ .01 Transitional as standard , for which a set of tool tracks is shown . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if it is a simple day , for example &amp; lt ; p@@ iss ; in your document , then click the symbol that represents the day . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to open and strip in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate them to open and strip . in the presentation with cart@@ ei@@ ghts are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; this view shows all files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project using a right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the search interface PubPsych offers an easy to use search interface in English , results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking on the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right clicking of an element , a list of commands will open up a list of commands in relation to navigation and refre@@ sher . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ espace are changing . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can create own documentation , and by adding an folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two card@@ holders at the bottom end of the window , which can be accessed via the useful information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this card pioneer shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD are shown . &quot;
&quot; this card pioneer shows all errors in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bar is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail .
&quot; in order to get a complete list of all options , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting up &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path is the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin file contains . you should also make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H before its bin folder . same applies to &amp; q@@ t ; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during an effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developer of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ sible mark@@ up languages editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of why development , which someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; - rum@@ ours is not only possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web@@ developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development , and has quickly become a mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developer left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more into the detailed documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest record is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you want to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there included special characters to &amp; HTML ; spelling , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ atting reference . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts text from cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; spelling , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag . &quot;
switch off the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the help of the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when you &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages exist !
looking for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bug@@ gers .
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . then , the selected files will then be copied to the project directory . &quot;
&quot; the project directory searches for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , copy graphic files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add it to the project . &quot;
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO firmware ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find details . &quot;
loading a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; this creates a dialog to add a new tool bar . this only creates the name . actions must be set by actions . actions must be stored on the tool bar , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool bar . &quot;
&quot; if you haven &apos;t yet saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
&quot; allows the loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else has done and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; load / f@@ lick of the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; . is sensible if the entities of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refre@@ shed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is not present in the global K@@ DE file , the loading fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu option in the tags menu , which contains the tags / actions on this tool bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day dialogue dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion is denied by the tool bar if this day is contra@@ di@@ cts the rules .
&quot; in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plugins are listed below the menu items listed above . click on a activated plug @-@ in . &quot;
select the syn@@ tax@@ onom@@ ic mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the works ; version .
&quot; choose the type of line identification . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or unnecessary graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selecting an entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the status bar on the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
judge the behaviour of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; works ; find details .
&quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or add which to change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help in the context of the mouse @-@ pointing device , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from above , as for example after completing the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set up with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering your name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without space with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you have local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ app@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web@@ in@@ ar that you want to download and change . in ser@@ vers@@ al scripts ( e.g. , PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is beginning to re @-@ started , don &apos;t hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to your own . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders available ) which will be re @-@ read for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . &quot;
&quot; in the pane profiles , high @-@ loading profiles can be set ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree view to the content of the server for each profile , by pointing out an own construction view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the Event Con@@ figuration , you can switch event actions and add these actions , modify or delete event actions , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . this behavior cannot be influenced at present . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select the project ... from the project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will appear and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
&quot; the project management view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; here , various profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see . &quot;
&quot; allows the removal of the latest profile . if only more a profile is available , the button will be termin@@ ated to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is needed , and the rather un@@ reliable password on the disk storage option is not in question . &quot;
&quot; this will stop the transfer or leave the dialog , if you change your mind before the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work . &quot;
&quot; the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o config . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this must not be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your Ang@@ ular wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded with many views in one project , i.e. by simple do@@ ches of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored or deleted in the project or project tool bar , accessible via the Tool@@ bar Tool@@ bar Project Tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own way of working .
&quot; as mentioned above , tool tracks in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best on the menu tool@@ bar are st@@ ack@@ able . use and adding are different . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the section adding tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and icons can be adjusted either via context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , which can be created using the New Action , a New Tool@@ bar , to ren@@ ame the tool@@ bar , ren@@ ame tool tracks or tool@@ bars , which can be displayed in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool@@ bars are to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , the entries will also be removed and action works that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings Tool@@ bars ... and set the actions .
&quot; Templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can copy , move , or any existing directory in the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you are preparing for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions described at the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; Bin@@ är is everything that is not pur@@ er text . it can be added any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc . binary Templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url ) . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document should be inserted based on a template , but the same text area to be inserted in the documents . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file as text as a local template . &quot;
&quot; as soon as this is done , you notice that ( even if it has been stored as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click on file as a template to store selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be drawn with drag and drop down to the template . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary Templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as pulling and laying or inser@@ ting the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project files , and create site template , enter a name for the template . by default , it is secured in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ enter header lines and foot@@ ers or link dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; shape files paste or link with them . additionally you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects .
&quot; the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folder matches one of four types of containers , as stated above . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the behavior of an folder , click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box containing the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear to appear explicitly . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a tribal folder . &quot;
this could be general header lines or lines for all templates in this folder . this could be general header lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the matching header lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you can use context menu ( click on it , press right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , the first mode replaces the source text editor , and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document , the &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ c of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit these directly with the V@@ PL ; there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor is active in the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor is active in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor is active , the key pressure is activated by a window to the others , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is set adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL ; view , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click , or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small chip for fast computers and a big chip for slow . &quot;
the document properties dialog will also be called when a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog will also be called upon as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; it is used to reduce the fatal coding . this means that you can change the following :
meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . meta @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below .
CSS @-@ Rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change of the list is just as possible with the meta @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is as in a word processor , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves differently . &quot;
&quot; adding tags will be made in the same way via the tool@@ bars , such as in the source code editor . it is important to note that tags are not removed before existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed from any other surrounding anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars such as the sp@@ read@@ sheet wizard or the Listen Assistant are disabled . they will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style templates . unlike other programs for style templates , the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be tra@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ ile , use other libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ xml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already existing . &quot;

&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a file name without a path name . file names in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded style file name with relative path to work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style file file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ sl , is the following input possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete compliance with a pre @-@ age named QNAP or a specified module name will be checked . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ espace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ espace in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ sl : test@@ 1 will be extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
&quot; a requested stop point must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this will automatically be re @-@ checked when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for comparing . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merger was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes , and at the same time had corrected a lot of text at the same time . another progra@@ mmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what changed within these lines . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare fast text for example , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made much work was compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ readable file browser .
&quot; this is useful when two people are working independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; while the automatic selection editor , you can edit the result even directly . in this editor , you can edit the result even directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merge : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and re@@ jects the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can view this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the indentation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can make the ti@@ p@@ par@@ b@@ eit easier by writing only the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; opening dialog lets you select file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be carried out . &quot;
&quot; if a file is selected , for B and C a folder , for B and C , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A to the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if colli@@ sions are crossed , the input field will be active and can be modified . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify a output file . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with comparing / mer@@ ging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would be a relatively great effort . you need only to copy , paste , and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : at present you can &apos;t withdraw from &amp; k@@ diff@@ . only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the notes A , B , C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed over the settings menu . ) &quot;
the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( Merg@@ ing ) good to see .
&quot; when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in character strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the context column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is displayed in dotted lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison window ) also has an info line with the headline output : , the file name and &#91; change &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved it is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to the least / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also to be resolved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left mouse button into the context column in one of the window , the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . &quot;
&quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps select another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a mark that you may copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; compilation account , however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white notes . &quot;
&quot; when you click on one of the window , you can also use the keyboard . if you click on one of the window , you can use the keyboard keys left , right , high , down , side down , side down , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the Au@@ dition window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button , you can change between inser@@ tion and over@@ writing mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
&quot; a click on the left mouse button in one of the assembly columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already described in the section , and the edi@@ table output window ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image up@@ stream / C@@ tr@@ l image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . &quot;
&quot; new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use W@@ agen@@ back + new@@ line backup \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the new@@ lines of the source files . therefore , you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically and restored when the next start . ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in recur@@ sive script are displayed . if the selected font does not support this presentation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab button . otherwise , a tab sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you enter or return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be found in the source files . only during this first step white signs are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart return mark &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line of line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others again store only a line of line &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the auto @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be shown before the next un@@ solved conflict is spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; this is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you require this only from time to time , use the Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or comments or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are handled in chapter to scan folders and direc@@ tories . check for details under documentation , for example , and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ orig . if already such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ orig exists , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set there globally via the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; the selection fields for en@@ coding will appear a short notice , which is the local en@@ coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file en@@ coding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the en@@ coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have processed a file , you can specify which en@@ coding is to be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you may not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre@@ processor command can only handle with 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II . ) With this option you can set the en@@ coding of pre@@ processor commands . &quot;
&quot; ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a colored coded text column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function , for example , to remove disturbing parts or correct inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is delivered first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , the output of the command will only be used when the command line is used . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to enable users to create more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word substitution ) .
&quot; while you experiment with sed experim@@ entation , you may begin to understand it and maybe you may like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line spac@@ ing . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 678@@ 9 - &#93; / / g &apos; Any character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is an hits , and any hits will be replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you might want to perform multiple objectives once . then , you can use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the requirements from each other . example : &quot;
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; aller@@ dings are different from per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needed , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the pre@@ dispos@@ ed &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for the display and to merge . the other operations only change the data that the Zei@@ ss @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the Zei@@ l@@ Query Pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or hidden differences , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in one folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders . &quot;
... makes every object a proposal to merge ; you can adapt the proposal before the start .
... can simul@@ ate the mer@@ ging and displays the simulated changes without doing it really .
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
&quot; this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to open a folder on the command line , or in the dialog . &quot;
&quot; when three folders are merged , Fol@@ der 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the mer@@ ging . to start the merge , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you &apos;ll be informed of a small news window about current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files are listed , which have been compared to that date . &quot;
&quot; if the scan of the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and every folder that was found during scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or double click the arrow keys to the left / right . &quot;
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the collision action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types .
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; if the files are different , then an error message error : files are different but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. if such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folder cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during mer@@ ging , a file is processed after the other . you status column shows Fer@@ tig when the merge has been successful , and according to other messages , if something unexpected happened . if the merge is completed , you should check out and see if the status is OK . &quot;
&quot; this includes the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resol@@ ving conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the mer@@ ging actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you don &apos;t have a target folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode , B will be used as a target , and when the two folders merge , B will be selected as a target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , check if all entries should be in the target folder , even in the folder structure . &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu , or press F@@ 7 ( the key ) . &quot;
&quot; when conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears on the er@@ ron@@ eous elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options through , simul@@ ate and cancel . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulating if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made , then you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again and continue direc@@ tories , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry , or solve the problem in a different way before you merge with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , the entries ( in the current session ) will not be recorded again . even if the mer@@ ging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be re @-@ merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 Settings ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are shown in the element tree .
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ etting is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ etting is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .c@@ v@@ signal file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a previous point is marked . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links will show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
&quot; if you compare big folders on a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and the file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; similar to confi@@ denti@@ ality of the date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging will be selected so that both folders are identical . the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is turned off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another , the original version is ren@@ amed and the extension .@@ original if an old backup file exists with the .@@ original extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ menu : read new &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ one . or .. included . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit auth@@ oriz@@ ations or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change date from the original . ( this is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently being a distinction viewer in the Devel@@ op . K@@ DE@@ VELO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is a patch file in the unified format . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ . ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work when no of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s a compli@@ ment ) there is already . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge with diff@@ use from the Di@@ ff Tool Collection . &quot;
&quot; this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way , or will let him go so . &quot;
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not comp@@ ile the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the common purpose the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor not@@ ices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict easily by clicking into the source code and entry of the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort is so far too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text should be used another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No src is thrown , and the text cannot delete itself . what does that mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and lacking the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer . &quot;
information about how you can use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir provides the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists thereof . &quot;
&quot; cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or loop re@@ mo@@ ver ) to the cli@@ p@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ b@@ alt insert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position , or replaces the current marking . &quot;
&quot; only differences are shown : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to update the folder with the update function . ) &quot;
&quot; if the target folder does not contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later version of the program . ) This option is turned off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ tones in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite practical to see the current programs on the desktop , change their size , end them or move them . this works both within a desktop and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the current applications . applications can be selected and even on the desktop and on others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , window within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved ; the movement is possible both within a working area and other areas of work . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only contains the two entries P@@ ager . if however , the context menu only contains the two entries P@@ ager . &quot;
the application window maxim@@ izes the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check@@ box is checked , window within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager display ; the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . if it is displayed along with name , the names will be marked with name numbers , eg ; 1st desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each work surface is also shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the current programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty surfaces will be displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window will be selected . simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window displays a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window will be determined : classic &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , like from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work@@ spaces appear horizont@@ ally and vertical in a vertical row , which is very well suited for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar .
click on the right mouse button inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set the setting of the switch ... lets the dialog appear .
&quot; at the moment , it cannot be changed in the dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have permission for the file , you must register as user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual disability . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly expanding to new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers . &quot;
&quot; when you &amp; k@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . below , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
in default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter as a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse cur@@ sor on the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse po@@ inter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the form of the mouse @-@ pointing device . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following manner : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fier and move . this is also done with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you add the &amp; Shift ; button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can shift the selection box . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the drop box . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firmly and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , copy in a file , turn into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more . &quot;
start / stop updating the display . stopping the update causes the CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Straight , Medium , High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection box is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically re@@ charge your set @-@ up short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button document in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and cr@@ ushing &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; it may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ p . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen , as would you use a magni@@ fier to view the printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for various people of benefit : from research or artist to web designer or visual acu@@ ity . &quot;

it is intended to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I Syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which each mouse click pains pain .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse po@@ ol@@ ts a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who are suffering from the rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and which each mouse click em@@ ulate pain . however , this requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you feel pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; in order to clarify it again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that will occur when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by the controls of the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be eliminated . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and execute a mouse click as soon as you break the movement .
&quot; the smart displac@@ ement is activated , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse to the end of the movement before letting the mouse button be executed . &quot;
&quot; this time period must be stored after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if Intelli@@ gent@@ es Move On , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . &quot;
&quot; these movements are saved in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move the response time to sh@@ orten the response time . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , becomes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; it is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; at the moment , this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please refer to the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the last pressing of users . &quot;
&quot; the best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart displac@@ ement should initially be switched off . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later push the smart displac@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in areas in the browser window that doesn &apos;t show any link does not lead to unwanted reactions . therefore , you can par@@ ken the mouse in such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is ru@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not just clean the mouse ball but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or finger nails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare cases , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart displac@@ ement , that means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the operation can no longer be removed by letting the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . this will set the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want to have it . but par@@ ken the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard navigation . secure zones for mouse @-@ cur@@ sor keys are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus , and the front lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , and then insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse in pressed mouse buttons . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart displac@@ ement , if you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select Text instead as follows : perform a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the switch button to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse clicks a sound like a mouse click . then you can use the intelligent displac@@ ement without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test extension must be installed for &amp; X window ; this should be the case in most systems . &quot;
&quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker , and these are set correctly . &quot;
&quot; this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and who are suffering from the pain of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse release is released . in this way , the drag and drop can be performed using the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the dum@@ b user can let their computers speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the language edition of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the word of word . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can use the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary so that only correctly letter words can be added to the word translation . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field you want to hear . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setting dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the site of word @-@ ending and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card card voice output , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the box below the input field , set the character en@@ coding to be passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; know two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text will be passed on as standard input to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the box is not selected , the text is passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the App@@ endix . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the k@@ tt@@ s@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications will be a stand@@ ar@@ dised interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cuts or by selecting a text passage in the text pass@@ book or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection field closing the editing window for text pass@@ age@@ buch , you can specify whether the text pass@@ age@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pass@@ age@@ buch , the book is stored . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book is not stored . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ age@@ buch should be saved . &quot;
&quot; in the main window next to the input field , it displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right , you can delete or add dic@@ tionaries , modify or export the order of the books , or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the box the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can combine the available dic@@ tionaries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tionaries are merged , and how these are to be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this option gives you a new , empty dictionary without entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered words automatically add to the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for processing text pass@@ ag@@ ings is divided into two sections . in the upper part , the text passages are presented as a tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ ening . if you have selected a text pass@@ book , you can only modify its name . &quot;
&quot; add new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text pass@@ ers or text pass@@ agen by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text @-@ cut is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iry date . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text @-@ cut is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iry date . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is found in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the exp@@ iry date will be used . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a mov@@ able tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool bar is placed directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag the tool bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sli@@ dable bar for text passages with entries is displayed . the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar by default . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag the tool bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; probably , you don &apos;t have the command for voice output properly or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ izer for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival will be installed in the / usr / local / festival . &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently it supports only the English pron@@ unciation .
&quot; in order to show an example of the command line for the setting of the voice output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ops folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows MB@@ RO@@ LA to use free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last sign of the text so that an additional sign must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo ) ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option data must be enabled as standard input .
the voice edition dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; since the setting of the voice generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use k@@ tt@@ s@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; adjust . &quot;
&quot; to setup the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the setting dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use , you need a voice generator ( and course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak text by the computer . &quot;
&quot; note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not a voice synthes@@ izer . on the computer , a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed . &quot;
&quot; for more detailed user documentation , please refer to help : / k@@ mouth ( give either this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start a hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a modules of existing service , which allows every application to read text about the &amp; DB@@ us ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers are ready , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . &quot;
&quot; reading texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor , also if &amp; are ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are embedded . &quot;
&quot; speech output is performed via the speech speech dispat@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , etc . &quot;
allows the creation of voice output on command line ( or using shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
&quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Markup Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and speech mark@@ up meta @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ de language edition ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; DB@@ us ; &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; configuration and setup of k@@ tt@@ s@@ d over k@@ tt@@ s@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser and con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor and works ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ zilla database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ domain mailing list , you can also find the list of https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ domain . the developers can also be found in IRC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ domain ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install program speech dispat@@ cher and adjust correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; in the first start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ g or as long as no actors are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card will be shown . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as various male or female , or those who distinguish themselves in volume or speed . you should at least use several variants for a synthes@@ izer . &quot;
different actors for the same synthes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable with multiple pres@@ sur@@ ized queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card @-@ card recipient in k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr , the card card is displayed . this will then appear automatically when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr and no or@@ ator is set up . &quot;
the preferred speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not exist .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a j@@ une and girl voice . &quot;
&quot; in order to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the map tab General and check if voice output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) so that the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the card card to create and manage text orders . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker installed , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map card pioneer to open this card card . here you can set some common options . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr is termin@@ ated , run &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field voice output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check@@ box is selected and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ Gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the preview is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can start text orders , break , stop and resume . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board template , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all the changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card card is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the card reader General and activate language outputs ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the indicated website . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; then check the text that should be read , and select the text that should be read , and choose the language edition . &quot;
&quot; this works even if it works ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; , which noti@@ fies you about the events defined by you . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;

&quot; it removes the tags br and b from the news that sends K@@ mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech dispat@@ cher program . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to replace incorrect spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dispat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
the output of screen re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is exc@@ essi@@ vely reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of news and normal text . these contracts will continue after the issue of the warning .
&quot; news is the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web site , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; messages are also messages . read this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each assignment you encounter from the card card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text applications . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order cards are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ a@@ sions . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts , this output will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . they are applied to normal warnings , news and text orders , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and give it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can still be more kinds of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre @-@ defined string holders that allow the creation of chat @-@ emot@@ icons as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding of the language .
&quot; &amp; XML ; conver@@ sions use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; of a format into another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can send text from K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules are not found , he will continue the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activ@@ ating filters that have been installed on the page . processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the standard normal filter . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and will not be used . filters will be processed in the row from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and the next setup dialog@@ s will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; for the creation of strings , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison sample . if this pattern is found in the text , the text is replaced with the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; for your filter a name . this name , you can choose to choose from the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages when clicking the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by commas . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs will be available with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; . the &amp; DB@@ us ; numbers must let you leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copies . &quot;
&quot; if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared to words , the character set filtering filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . so , the words must be limited to both sides . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such forming . but it can only be applied on well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
&quot; specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify texts by k@@ mail from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; when writing a text to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . &quot;
&quot; here is a value , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions are installed , you can access this with a click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text complet@@ es the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements . click on the button to display the selection selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to store , store , or delete all settings . &quot;
&quot; the speaker selection filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions will apply to an entry in the box Di@@ ameter Filter if you have to register at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the voice edition API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; DB@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; these synthes@@ iz@@ ers can use . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ DB@@ us ; -@@ Interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bili@@ ty@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice output over the &amp; DB@@ us ; -@@ Interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from program k@@ tt@@ s@@ d to the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; this is the text of the text to read and option a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more instructions that you can use . for a list of all commands you can specify .
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; windows . start just k@@ tt@@ s@@ d in a window , then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; reform@@ ulation filter , but when using the module for festival websites do not read web pages . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , so that SA@@ BLE does not work at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or inter@@ position marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or just b@@ unk@@ ers . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure the option character en@@ coding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string replacement filter . see . &quot;

KT@@ TS works with each voice synthes@@ izer that can be started at the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of the above mentioned languages can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; speech dispat@@ cher &quot; program uses a customizable module architecture for voice synthes@@ izer . if you want to extend the use of another synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and XML , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs package and the development files for the speech dispat@@ cher program . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code repository , or have downloaded the T@@ arb@@ all , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if speech dispat@@ cher is working properly with your voice synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the establishment of speech dispat@@ cher is directly possible , and the sp@@ d @-@ conf script is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user may withdraw the sentence or sub@@ stitu@@ tions , pause , stop or break the output . &quot;
&quot; if you have an application text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify the properties of the preferred subscri@@ ber for the output . if you want to learn a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , it is automatically selected by the best suitable speaker . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the card card spokesman on Add , and then click on the list or click on Edit , the card card spokesman @-@ set will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown . details on modules can be found below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival in PAT@@ H is included , you must only enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; in general , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sliders , you provide volume , speech speed and sound level of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controls and display this grey , the voice cho@@ oses these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these votes are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check@@ box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up an or@@ ator ( or forget to click on users ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check@@ box is checked , the k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr program window will be displayed at the start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol k@@ tt@@ sm@@ Gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check@@ box is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ Gr is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop reading or ste@@ er it otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the straight @-@ edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card card spokesman . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can specify in the order that is selected in the list below , before or back . ( but not every order consists of multiple sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be added to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts are not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card board . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text books are listed and managed . issues of screen re@@ viewers , warnings and messages are not shown . &quot;
&quot; here , select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , the necessary libraries cannot load . &quot;
&quot; if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . see also &quot;
&quot; set the speech speed here . 50@@ free ; % equ@@ als about half and 200@@ .@@ Shipping costs about twice a normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out what device works with you . in doubt , select standard . &quot;
&quot; this card card allows you to set up special promotions , which will always be executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
the output of screen re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is exc@@ essi@@ vely reserved . a warning stops the issue of news and normal text .
&quot; news is the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pronoun@@ ces messages . if you prefer to read a long text on a web page , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card are only valid for normal text orders . for news , warnings and the spending of screen re@@ a@@ vers there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; if this option is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; don &apos;t read any noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , noti@@ fications where a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list , or delete it . if you click Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent if someone mentioned your nickname in an IRC channel . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which there is nothing else in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignore . &quot;
use this selection field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following options :
&quot; if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , who is shown in the list on the card card spokesman as the top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a specific application is set for a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise the action will be executed for any other events of the specific application . &quot;
&quot; the event All al@@ erts for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the button to store the settings for noti@@ fications into a file . use the button loading to load stored settings from one file . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Delete . all entries except all messages are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Markup Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the standard voice , the festival in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very monot@@ on@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and set limits recognition filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . hence , you can start or pause , stop , stop and break , even if the voice synthes@@ izer doesn &apos;t support this directly . &quot;
&quot; in the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , you will be automatically set up a set @-@ limit recognition filter . you can modify its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; in the simpl@@ est way , you will learn the setup of the speaking selection by sample . switch off the selection menu and give text to read . check out the selection of the speakers , change some features and check how the selection of the subscri@@ ber is modified . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; you can stop or break text orders on the card card , even if the voice synthes@@ izer doesn &apos;t support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set of rules will be automatically set up when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and app@@ end a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) . note that the default setting of the stat@@ em@@ et filter is retained . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( notify ) , warnings , news or the issue of screen re@@ a@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from the standard rules of the rules , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;

use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card card spokesman ) . in other words : no speaking properties are specified .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the subscri@@ ber &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , who is closest to the originally set features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; here , select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , you do nothing . &quot;
check this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence before other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a primary property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a certain application is sent in another language than the language used in the working environment . &quot;

&quot; k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr crashes immediately when it started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any tra@@ ce@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem does not solve this problem , it is probably not a compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work , when I receive music at the same time with another application . if I receive a text order , freeze &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; console ; a message that says : Un@@ to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem that conflicts are occurring at AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have invited an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in the festival , but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / k@@ tt@@ s@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices add new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
some synthes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ s like Festival Interactive offers a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice it is active or in@@ active .
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are completely cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ forming er@@ filter , and set up the speech speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER does not seem to function . thus , the x@@ sl file thro@@ ws the x@@ sl file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a character set @-@ up filter , and now I can in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer set @-@ up or go back . on the card@@ holder assign@@ ments are displayed , the order is done only out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; if you are not allowed to filter for these characters , use a filter for the phrase limit recognition instead . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
g@@ stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or newer . note : make sure the modules for G@@ Stre@@ amer are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; follow the registry register . ( http : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and start a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also , if you have a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA website ( d@@ mix ) website . &quot;
&quot; in July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set is still being read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speaking speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Debian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included in most of the Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; when t@@ arb@@ all ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) downloaded , register as normal user and un@@ zip the t@@ arb@@ all into a matching folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created on request . &quot;
the following modules for voice synthes@@ izer are created by default . some of them have a running time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( not @-@ free according to the guidelines of Debian distribution ) .
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target option . for example &quot;
&quot; on Debian @-@ systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources . &quot;
CD k@@ de@@ viewer echo k@@ tt@@ s@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd k@@ tt@@ s@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if your voice synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must type for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ llic ( 8 @-@ bit ) en@@ coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , coding codes must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the en@@ coding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cyrillic , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ iz@@ ers . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
&quot; note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete speech output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create Di@@ ph@@ p.@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o . for more information , see below . &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files to be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Fol@@ ders will be installed , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a changed version of German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; , then download MS German Festival &quot;
instructions can be found in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 you don &apos;t need to re@@ comp@@ ile a festival ) . then add the following lines to the festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

&quot; on some systems , you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al.@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed german voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this hand@@ book the German de@@ 4 , De@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
&quot; this process uses special code to give the language over Festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both works . then download Festival @-@ Czech from &quot;
&quot; un@@ zip the program with tar in a suitable folder , and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your PAT@@ H . &quot;
download the cz@@ 2 voice file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; file .

&quot; Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice synthes@@ izer which currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with even more sufficient voice quality . &quot;
Fli@@ te is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are included . therefore , search for the first on CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage voice synthes@@ izer that works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice quality is good , but the support is currently limited to few languages . &quot;
download at least a German language file of the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip in the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the file name . &quot;
&quot; on the box set , select a voice and put the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o right . &quot;
&quot; epic is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slov@@ ak@@ ian language . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with even more sufficient voice quality . &quot;
&quot; start k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr . on the card card spokesperson click on Add . select the Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian language and Epo@@ s T@@ TS language synthes@@ izer . if the Epo@@ s programs are not available in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the card box . enter in a &amp; console ; e@@ pos -@@ h or say -@@ h to obtain further information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice synthes@@ izer that was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can no pitch , volume or speech speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a single &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center module , allowing the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ings and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center are displayed . the module settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ menu ; &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can &apos;t install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all shown and the setting of the network properties possible . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to load the following files , according to the kernel version . &quot;
the module network settings are loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module &apos;s network settings it tries to detect the platform used on the system automatically .
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the hand selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that is best suited to the distribution and release date . &quot;
&quot; the change of network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gray , which means , the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , you can access the system management mode at the right bottom end of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . &quot;
&quot; the rider network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out : &quot;
&quot; setting the settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface , set up in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are carried out by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP server sends all the necessary TCP / IP information for each system start , so no further adjustment is required . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of manu@@ als , the TCP / IP address must be specified without D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP . &quot;
&quot; if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
&quot; if required , network devices can be activated or switched off . switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ... &quot;
&quot; defines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by computers in other sub@@ nets by default . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is at http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS releases this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3,4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; this list can be added , removed , or modified . DNS entries can be added , removed , or modified in the list with the buttons down or down in the priority list . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button to add ... from the host computer to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the DNS server &apos;s IP address and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the host computer to the name resolution , select an entry and then click on the Edit ... It will display dialog Edit . &quot;
&quot; the list Nam@@ powered familiar computer describes the IP address references to the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used in the boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , isolated networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally the list of Nam@@ powered hosts lists some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are supported . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add ... The New alias will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click Add button . if the well @-@ known host has several alias names , add button add several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
&quot; select an entry of a particular known host from the list , and select Edit ... The familiar computer will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; it may be one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately available in the system . to activate the changes , you need to set the following command . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf homepage ; http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t is installed . &quot;
the installation of the complete compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but also requires the development packages with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and changed configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; this area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endix , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network will be communic@@ ated . &quot;
IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found a wide distribution of IP@@ v@@ 6 . this description is currently concent@@ rating on the common IP@@ v4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is attri@@ but@@ able to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to use a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be selected as arbit@@ rar@@ ily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the internet , therefore their arbitrary use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are mostly used in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 and 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . &quot;
the network address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit .
&quot; in this section , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically , so that it is not surprising if there is a different content to be found in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config , and another booth is expected to occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective extra@@ pack . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife presented : how much longer does it take when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and reads the pre@@ tension information of the band . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know if the band is to be form@@ atted on the band , you &apos;ll be asked if the band is to format . &quot;
&quot; if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index should be re@@ constructed . &quot;
&quot; when everything goes smoothly , the symbol of the tape is changed to show that the band has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the band can now be searched through the entry of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the band , that the integration for the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ arded without any danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band from &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat ; format . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be form@@ atted before you can use to save data . this process does not correspond to form@@ atting with &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not correspond to form@@ atting with &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not have to be form@@ atted before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; however , flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require a form@@ atting of the tape , DA@@ T drives . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , the band continues . all data on the band will be lost ! after finishing the form@@ atting process , the band will be automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the files to be visible . this can be done on three types : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be secured .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a bun@@ ks . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
&quot; with the right mouse button on the local file tree , and select &quot; &quot; Sich@@ ern &quot; &quot; menu ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup was introduced , the dialog will open for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will appear . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in one of the archives . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a bun@@ ks . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry exam@@ iner ....
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work folder for review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears to check . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot;
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Rest@@ ore Menu .... &quot;
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the Band@@ index@@ File on the basis of the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ generate the index on two types of the band :
&quot; in this way , a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings is created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current working folder , in which the backup is to take place . &quot;
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , it is true that only the files are stored in the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be placed separately under backup files . each entry is viewed from tar regardless of the other . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and create a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
you can set up your settings via the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for the belt drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ R@@ ew@@ in@@ ding version of the band device .
&quot; in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection at the belt drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when del@@ eting &amp; k@@ dat files , the band is thrown out automatically . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not you must share the block size for your tape drive .
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host name : seconds , whereby the name is the full name of the system where the band has been form@@ atted . seconds , the number of seconds passed since the era has been form@@ atted in which the band has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives , which can be administr@@ ated directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as it is not for incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system has the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system leaves the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can access quick access to information about issues related to their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files are filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
&quot; many other functions are also included in addition , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual . &quot;
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with their help to filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not be shown , and it opens itself instead of a small news window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system failure . &quot;
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected crit@@ erion .
&quot; of course , you can also select another entry . &quot;
&quot; this option is enabled in default setting , and helps you recognize the important protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; if you want to show a specific process ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can turn the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new incoming protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display . &quot;

&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system evol@@ ves rapidly to the standard for controlling the program starts in the &amp; Linux ; world . and , therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go to historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without a new installation and new form@@ atting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was there . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folder : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services include such things such as set@@ serial , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the r@@ c.@@ local should be located in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first thing he finds .
the default run@@ time is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably realize that the default Run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you are going to change the in@@ it@@ tab changes . if you want to change something , then you can repair it by rest@@ oring the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does all the right scripts start ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument as start and stop . you can actually run these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K contains , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will be called by the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level , that can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ time , the &amp; gt ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another time machine is simple to not be tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ time to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . in this case , the entry from its original Run@@ time ( or its position ) is removed . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . in order to simply copy them to a new run@@ time , you must expres@@ sly select copy from the menu Edit or select the context menu and then add it to the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ti@@ cker number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again . &quot;
note : there is no way to restore entries which were thrown into the trash bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to enable the different working areas ( available system services , Run@@ time 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to hit a selection above or below . &quot;
&quot; to move one entry into another run@@ time , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ time with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually change the sor@@ ti@@ cker number or names of an entry , press the button to change the properties dialog . use the tab button to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts to rest@@ art . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the LI@@ LO pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab , and change the default run@@ time to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ time X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) can be termin@@ ated without any message if their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ time to be added to this manual . &quot;
&quot; this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the users and groups of your system . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either you use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user and user groups list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with double @-@ click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some cards cards will only be displayed if you have made advanced system settings . only if you have enabled placement restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card is created in which you can make individual settings . other cards may appear if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; the password management card system appears if shadow passwords , or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; this card card only appears if for at least a built @-@ in file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , for each user , parameters can be changed , with the limitations of the data in KB are : &quot;
&quot; these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field of file system , with space limitation . &quot;
&quot; the card card groups inform@@ s about the group affili@@ ation of the selected user . the standard group , which belongs to the user , will be found in the primary group . furthermore , users can be a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click on the matching Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , remove and change the boot password , remove and change the time up to the boot of the default operating system , add the default operation system , remove , change operating systems , change , change , and more . &quot;
