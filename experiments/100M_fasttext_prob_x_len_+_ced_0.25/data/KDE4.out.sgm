<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, balance, automatic compensating and contrast from the menu Corrigating Automatic correction try to make the best thing out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminance values over the whole picture so that the darkest dot black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its colour saturation.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the luminosity range of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic balance: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">"contrast, this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in between. this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"if you are working too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction are better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview will be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image as well as the preview of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminanz."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your score depends on shadow, saturation and gamma."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pixels is overexposed.. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is shown in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons Save as and loading do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set you can save this into a text file, and later load again."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the button preset settings sets all the filter values back to its standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will be added another photo as your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the code depth per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high quality pictures."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw pictures. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">"this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously, so you can always adjust your settings so that you need to make use of these for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error, and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">"a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find gradation in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digikam; tool color effects provides four color effects, a solar filter effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon effect and a channel filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solaris, also known as Sabatier, was an effect that arose when one partially developed a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and it works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefor a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers highly saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon-filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the strength of the neon lights. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it's not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too great saturation. in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase them."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and simple luminosity / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on sound value correction for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you need only the area of the slider. concrete the three slider below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, histogram, active channel or the selected area."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn is to shift the controller and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the image. on the left hand, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box, the histogram can be set with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the medium for the light tones and the bottom for the middle tones, often called Gammavalues."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinplates can be used in the preview of the original image, to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and light tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values, e.g. for the input values."</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: this button will automatically set the image values depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and loading: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and reloaded later. this is used to use the Gimp Levels format."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and solar windows. enable the color pipette which you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the option overexposed indikator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixel and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it's no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2)."</seg>

<seg id="436">"on the preview of the original photos is a red marking. if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste."</seg>

<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera has often been applied for internal sharpening. images in the raw format must always be sharped during processing."</seg>

<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should avoid careful handling because the results do not seem very natural: the sharpening increases sharpness of edges but also strengthens the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen one image can refocus. you can find more information and compare all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to make soft marks with the menu entry corrigation plasticizing and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right-hand side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>

<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount."</seg>
<seg id="492">"high resolution images allow greater radiations. therefore, they should be sharpened in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage of the original and the wiser image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold is a rupture from the maximum RGB value and the use difference-amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference with a soft change between the sounds of sharpening, and therefore blemishes in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">"the & digikam, tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected removal filtering algorithm by Ernst Lippe."</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese Filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. the traditional technique used to sharpen the image is the use of a sharpness mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding is much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result from the source pixies that are far from the original quellpixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1; eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very poor."</seg>
<seg id="502">"in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value equal to zero, you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the additive filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can generate good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any refocus parameter you set will be saved for later, and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that many operations make changes that are not visible immediately, but which later leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, Unsharp Masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurring a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, Unsharp Masks must always create artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never be the effect of the sharpness."</seg>

<seg id="517">This tool contains various presettings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the horsemen smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail-keeping p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the picture."</seg>
<seg id="520">"directional dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all.p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, put this value to the degree of noise in your picture."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is running. normally here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle steps [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if alpha is chosen small, it should also be small. make sure that small corners can create a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs acceptable."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrential step width [0,1, 10]: integrential step width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the More in quality that you get through selecting this option is minimal. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to let him out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and loading do exactly this. each setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and will be recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"error correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button abruptly."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused a bad film storage during the journey. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts like dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireactor; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can be blended with the image and the color in it will be smoothed and thus minor errors can be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="536">"if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and noise or lubrication occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge of edge for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it cannot remove the entire noise or noise level. put it to a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">"luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or light density to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process, which is controlled by the details settings."</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or light density to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically stronger, but also polluted the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjustment of phase jittery attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive Filterradius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, noise and phase jitter may occur."</seg>
<seg id="542">"store under and loading: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for noise reduction, which you have set, can be stored in the file system and later loaded."</seg>

<seg id="1044">"if you switch off anti-aliasing, calculates and connect & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling the adjacent pixels will be split up and adaptively because each pixel depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"when you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixels will be handled with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two Pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between color values exceeds the threshold threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be followed individually and checked for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another possibility to reduce the Aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch off Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern."</seg>

<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good pleasure for music of young, portable devices and car-stereoilers. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that manually entered or fetched from freedb via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create folder and file names and the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the codec and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the encoding will explain the switch to these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title must be added by lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what freedb is: a free database, in which people read the audio CDs that can download / enter information, so all other information can be downloaded instead of the computer: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (referring to the translator: this is the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address will not be used to retrieve the data from the server (This can only know the programmers who have checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographic is to be used by the closest mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the computers."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD;. alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumours that cdparanoia is used; those who want to know more accurately, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package should be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"in the first open are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compressing for audio data) on the tab card to set up the coding."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for predefined coders. more information about Kodiver are in the chapter Welcher Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a coding, more information about his switch can be obtained by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reader feedback and whether both cdparanoia and the audio codeers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with one step for example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, all understood, but somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">"in this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and our first & CD; read. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 (tags)."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"there must be cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. however, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do."</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write texts on it (eg; by trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">"the first section treats the basic setup of & audiocreator;, something which is probably just done once and"</seg>
<seg id="1548">"the second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD;, which needs to be repeated for any outgoing & CD;"</seg>
<seg id="1549">"here we determine the compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we share the program with the freedb to download the & CD; data from the internet."</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it at any reading of a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found."</seg>

<seg id="1558">"apart from this example, please note: if you want to enter anything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode when you download the database before. however, this is more than 620 MB large, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to freedb in the offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map card."</seg>

<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a rifle shot."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"if the MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (rifle shooting), patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch, each note represents another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"like the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as well as their presence. so, you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel. check out the supplied keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section may be used to map some channels to others. if you want to swap the first and the second channel, make it easy for the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>

<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following samples:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the KEYMAP option, the KEYMAP needs to be defined in the file name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for Pitch BenderRatio indicates, in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied with the value n, this is converted to the value n * (r / 4096) and then it is only forwarded. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file no decimal comments are available)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is used because GM anticipates that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, is to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards are trying to play two tones up to an octave."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel).</seg>

<seg id="1680">"the channel view has two different views, in order to display the played sounds."</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD displays the speed with which one song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, a song is too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. this allows the same MIDI file to be played on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>

<seg id="2284">"this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"if you want to compare fast text for example, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a fully-readable file browser.</seg>

<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how much these functions are, it would be a relatively great effort. you need only to copy, paste, and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present you can't withdraw from & kdiff. only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and paste). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source window contains the notes A, B, C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.)

<seg id="2305">The color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (Merging) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">"when differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in character strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line, which separates the context column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is displayed in dotted lines."</seg>

<seg id="2315">"when you click on one of the window, you can also use the keyboard. if you click on one of the window, you can use the keyboard keys left, right, high, down, side down, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, siw as you can also use it from other programs."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"in the Audition window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insert button, you can change between insertion and overwriting mode. (default is the insertion mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">"a click on the left mouse button in one of the assembly columns synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already described in the section, and the editable output window)."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-image upstream / Ctrl image downwards) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, between dissolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the marking into the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion)."</seg>
<seg id="2320">"newlines are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use Wagenback + newline backup\\ r\. KDiff3 reserves the newlines of the source files. therefore, you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries."</seg>

<seg id="2324">"in systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form."</seg>

<seg id="2329">"when comparing files, & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines can be found in the source files. only during this first step white signs are ignored."</seg>
<seg id="2330">"some editors (on some systems) save a cart return mark '\\ r' and a line of line '\' at the end of a line, others again store only a line of line '\'."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"in default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored."</seg>

<seg id="2334">"in the auto-jump mode, this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be shown before the next unsolved conflict is sprayed."</seg>
<seg id="2335">"this is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you require this only from time to time, use the Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options ignore numbers or comments or Ignoriere C / C + + comments."</seg>

<seg id="2340">"the selection fields for encoding will appear a short notice, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)"</seg>
<seg id="2341">"adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"if you have processed a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"if you define pre-processing commands, you may not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessor command can only handle with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of preprocessor commands."</seg>

<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a colored coded text column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply use the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">"sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pre-set name for the output file.

<seg id="2355">"the ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for a further pre-processing command for line spacing. sed's / [0123456789 -] / / g 'Any character between' ['and'] 'is an hits, and any hits will be replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted."</seg>

<seg id="2360">"the preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or hidden differences, you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case."</seg>

<seg id="2957">"the V Init system evolves rapidly to the standard for controlling the program starts in the & Linux; world. and, therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go to historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to convert a machine to System V Init without a new installation and new formatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was there."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services include such things such as setserial, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"the rc.local should be located in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first thing he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runtime is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably realize that the default Runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful if you are going to change the inittab changes. if you want to change something, then you can repair it by restoring the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does all the right scripts start? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument as start and stop. you can actually run these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K contains, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will be called by the argument."</seg>

<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv;. it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another time machine is simple to not be trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runtime to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. in this case, the entry from its original Runtime (or its position) is removed."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. in order to simply copy them to a new runtime, you must expressly select copy from the menu Edit or select the context menu and then add it to the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorticker number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again."</seg>

<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to enable the different working areas (available system services, Runtime 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to hit a selection above or below."</seg>
