&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extremely big .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American films , studied American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Letter , a fear@@ less reporter who covered the murder@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were keen to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; on the other hand , it is the most important thing to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration for the USA had only increased . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot;
I even had a very sham@@ anic love letter written about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , as he goes with his narrow alle@@ gi@@ ance . &quot;

&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and declar@@ es his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in favour of him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won by republi@@ can pre @-@ elections , was the highest number one ever achieved by the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalism program , bringing people out of the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ umps world outlook did not correspond with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met us in our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump Int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she is still adap@@ ting to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always with a lot of patience and grace to me and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Griff@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me much in my career . &quot;
&quot; these people , and the values embo@@ died by them , deep@@ ened my love to America . &quot;
&quot; during Tr@@ ump &apos;s path to nomin@@ ating republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a hold and counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans en@@ rolled over 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they were either shared with racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; one of my friends , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on another way and think .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears are not taken into account of the h@@ ectic changes in their communities .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most white have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; but one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m. d. Ü . : as much as &quot; &quot; white against all other ethnic groups &quot; &quot; ; word@@ play from white to the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much like Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the big Van Jones , has just killed what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which belief or background should always have , America is welcome everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election Donald Tr@@ ump , however , there is a huge part of the White America of this promise and says : hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America , after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , have my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
did Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; would anyone , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t it your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ ump &apos;s land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America . &quot;
and this breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t leave their love to music through g@@ arbage

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ic city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
&quot; the music that is played in both places not only has changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large g@@ arbage d@@ ump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds far from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults with their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome them . &quot;
a musical school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this was changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they are always laughing and with glos@@ sy eyes and play in the chest you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mbone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from ru@@ bb@@ ish
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically at the top of the largest land@@ fill site of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ay@@ an capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ peti@@ tive instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made out of the g@@ arbage . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , re@@ members : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents were working in the trash , the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made out of litter .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic g@@ arbage d@@ ump ) records the musical performance :
&quot; every year , the world produces about one billion tonnes of waste . &quot;
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspi@@ rational spectacle of g@@ arbage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices , the re @-@ release happens in the context of a common use of content . &quot;
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated in Liber@@ ian waters before it was looking for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal off@@ ender of this kind in their co@@ asts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and Sey@@ ch@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything &quot; , &quot; Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , because of pill@@ aging of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and working together . they exchange information and stand together with each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to detect . thus illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
&quot; through the deliber@@ ate dis@@ respect of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and types should be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , these actions happen in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange licenses of existing licenses , susp@@ icious activity or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive , if they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fishing in forbidden areas , such as those who suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fish fan@@ atic , where they were on the way and possibly even if they were a criminal . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what does that mean that the ships can &apos;t sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay for pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consultant firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already @-@ called platform was created to reg@@ ain the estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ish @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate in East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of imag@@ inary names , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ organised control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; previously , a ship could fishing and a land could then say &apos; You can &apos;t walk my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships . &quot;
&quot; it has un@@ covered criminal networks that distri@@ butes fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has been persec@@ uted and found . &quot;
&quot; due to his collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing in large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to detect susp@@ icious ships .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to detect illegal vessels that love to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross , &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Chief analyst at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; for example , some of the ships will turn off their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be loc@@ alized by satelli@@ tes . &quot;
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal acts with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s Team of African Nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of what &apos;s doing - that &apos;s simply meaning , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and consoli@@ date their resources into the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; Shi@@ ri App@@ le@@ by in &quot; &quot; Code Black &quot; &quot; dabei &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile reported a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats have been buying more licenses since then . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing nets whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear annually by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined together , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative working method to protect the oc@@ eans actually works throughout the world . Emma Bry@@ ce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the topic of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to increase : &quot;

they are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on the referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations about the political and economic crisis of the country were running into the void by gathering on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) can be seen both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the north of the province of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the country &apos;s political and economic situation wor@@ sen@@ ed continuously , which is reflected in the daily routine of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental shift in the minist@@ erial meeting of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , maintaining a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; in its latest article , Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , member of the Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summari@@ zes the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % of the year &apos;s financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine is , the referendum to take the opportunity to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and close a new governance alliance . &quot;

especially large waves hit the news about police repression in the central north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests went on . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skirts , because you could see anything else what many national gar@@ den@@ ers do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic is already making the turn that forms the scale of oppression a day : &quot;
&quot; thus , the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial procedure , which has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many people on the street . &quot;
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your help !
on the street !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has taken little against the devastating economic crisis , and rather has to stop critical voices : &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing to frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on August 23 , 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of C@@ ór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said to his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial in the province of C@@ ór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the brush to carry the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in Pr@@ ison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; for 34 years , he kept family secret for himself . &quot;
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that was right . &quot;
I felt like a secret magic .
&quot; as a child , 15 years old , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not know that my father was a th@@ ief , a tort@@ urer and a mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ an officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the scale of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power is a parent of his child , and how this child chose a path of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
everyone named him &quot; Kent . &quot;
I told my father about him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP . &quot;

&quot; therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would be hearing . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ then the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
&quot; during the first and last time , he left me at the entrance to the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; when I opened it , I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners tor@@ tured .
&quot; I se@@ wed in , and saw a couch that was tor@@ tured on the man . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal fe@@ athers .
&quot; later , I found out that they were attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body , which lay just there . &quot;
&quot; they rarely have a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured him with water , and pursued him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... as a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can hurt another so much suffering ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were tied down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you think , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero hit a man there and killed .
&quot; ( according to information of survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the Memorial of La Per@@ la , leads to the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here is also the way , where the kidn@@ apping came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look on the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came to be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; war be@@ asts &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things to home .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war@@ riors &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later in the military , I was in the Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military rab@@ bit that one has fought against one enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... steal , then that is not a war be@@ arded , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminals and I answered , &quot; &quot; You , who sti@@ rs cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
&quot; he exploded out of anger , struck me and cried out : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we need no one else !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a craw@@ ler pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I was accused of being a co @-@ con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I said no problem , they can lay me on the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there to cancel out anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went to say so far :
&quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easy to put them into jail .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but what their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even have families with whom they could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that one can do with a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were ex@@ h@@ orted and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find something , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea to display my father was created during a conversation when he stood under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the cru@@ el@@ ties I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t know anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly dead and asked me , why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me about this ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
&quot; you have committed terrible crimes , and you have forced me as a child to take part in it . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I created the first ad . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me that I am taken over . I have finally said to my own father .

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto in &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;

editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence , in the last month , witness a very un@@ fortunate translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; , &quot; wrong@@ ly - maybe even with malicious background thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1 to 20 September , the wrong translation was on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself . &quot;
&quot; book for children , 1920 Bot@@ anic representations &quot;
&quot; the error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ otos , and he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n Daily News wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correc@@ tions .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the incorrect English translation was removed first . the term &quot; &quot; horrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gramm@@ atically not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator , and that the translation was not reviewed on their accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blogger reported as follows :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News replaced a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older car drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents , however , are quite a reason for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , 1,9@@ 41 of total 19,@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;

&quot; - &quot; &quot; so faul@@ ty is the translation really not , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
you need two important skills : passive voice skills in order to understand the original and active language skills in order to transmit it to the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general the belief that trans@@ lators in the target language should not be in the initial language - not in the initial language - native speakers .
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;

&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as native language , which could make translations into English . this may be attri@@ but@@ able to the lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ reasons or the relatively small number of native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , leave translations in their company internally . then , the Japanese employees , whose knowledge of English skills , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good . &quot;

machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and enig@@ matic phrases , which arise through machine translation , show that this technique can still not replace human trans@@ lators . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the enig@@ matic prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;

&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harm@@ less , but by big companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto uses a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on the internet and television

&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an internet users found that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; also other online transm@@ it@@ ters carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that contra@@ dict the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s responsibilities to the executive and Supreme Court itself . &quot;

&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 when reporting about protests . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and cl@@ auses when they continue to report on the demonstrations as the Commission saw this as &quot; &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national television channels .
it is amazing that it is still cheaper to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ G@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds to def@@ ective or denied the request by calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast on Thursday , 6th April , was set when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera @-@ c@@ amer@@ aman Elvis Fl@@ ores , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested . &quot;
&quot; Fl@@ ores was beaten , while he was in police custody . &quot;
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on broadcast again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , so that the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multi @-@ media coverage on the current events in the country are increasingly difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get a training &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .

photo by Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of tur@@ ally .
&quot; the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report of tur@@ ally , published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , which is processed and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she returned to the house once again and heard the owner of the house full of pride , she said . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 5,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money gives her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that is within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted . &quot;
&quot; this practice is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society , and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she talked with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collecting testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call the things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is in@@ oc@@ ulated to the Cri@@ adi@@ a is generally still silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they can shut down their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and whose exploitation is justified by faith is that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the so @-@ called relatively unknown phenomenon occurred in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín was in the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent pun@@ ches . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant in the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants situated 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra proposed a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; organizations like UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , deeply involved in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society , were responsible for the death of the girl . &quot;
they marked the Cri@@ ba@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; several dozen people gathered in protest demonstrations and called for &quot; &quot; no other Carolina &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to inj@@ ure the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;

the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers ; they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to go to work and began to sell swe@@ ets on the street or market , to earn money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital of As@@ unci@@ on as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
she stood at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , it clean@@ ses the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she had done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but got no unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the master &apos;s library as food out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the owner , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand beside him and read the editorial from opposition papers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to do not believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not allow me to visit my family because they had the opinion that I would go back to &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would speak their mother tongue in Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; her Lord feared that she would lose the education they had allowed her to lose , she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , her was completely clear that she had paid for everything she received from them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken is mob@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school . &quot;

&quot; sixty Egyptian MPs have recently approved a bill on &quot; &quot; regulation concerning the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users and users of social media have to register in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up , which is entru@@ sted with it , to share with citizens a permit to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with adoption of the law , users and users have to register on the site of the site with their proper names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a bu@@ ckle . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six paragraphs , is cur@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any use that is running and used to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not provide a reference to how Egyptian authorities should account for the user and users of the registration . it is unclear how they should account for the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to register the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of the Parliament , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall , which blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyp@@ tians and Egyp@@ tians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt strongly in the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent , physical public and private spaces can also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , then it means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial process . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it goes into the plen@@ ary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his assumption and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the Parliament , where the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; Ra@@ o@@ of says . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cyber crime in which a life @-@ long sentence for those who were found guilty of threatening the &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dator in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and the memory of the ecos@@ ystem will depend on the fact that a large pre@@ dator is present . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ related daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the past six years to re@@ build the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered disaster . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ agi pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ agi and the neighboring pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami destroyed all coastal towns from the map . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima experienced a nuclear accident , but already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress made six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and survey results of the affected individuals themselves .
&quot; the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , 77 per cent of planned replacement houses have been completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ agi , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;

the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools which were affected by mis@@ fortune were opened up to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ agi are now in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of fish@@ eries have res@@ umed their operation . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of ag@@ r@@ arian land , have grown into a passion . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ agi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has repeatedly recovered , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far away . &quot;

&quot; in their edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the situation of ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;

&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the stand of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home @-@ pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which are still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ unter@@ kunft@@ hausen , older than 50 years old . they are well @-@ known because the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ agi , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima have to compete with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 . &quot;

&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media trans@@ forms street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window shield . &quot;

&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window window than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special issue . &quot;
this must also be recognised if it is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; even here , the term &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; receives an absurd , disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are replaced by headlines with the title &quot; &quot; protesters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cuba : the Road towards Governance and Stability ( audio EN )
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba have opened the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
&quot; after that , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
approximately 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
&quot; other re@@ signed and p@@ add@@ ling daily to the factories , which still gr@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; a soldier who runs every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn &apos;t bol@@ ster his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the East of the region of sugar cane factories , which are back in operation after a long time , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
&quot; it reminds us that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already imp@@ acted the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the poor harv@@ ests are no more new@@ ness . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway line of the church saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot;
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Shortage and Overeducation
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
&quot; however , the sugar price increased about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; Agricultural Security &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will be safe in history , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
&quot; the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first deport@@ ation year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; the document located at &lt; http : / / www.g@@ fb@@ v.@@ it / 2@@ c @-@ stamp@@ a / 03 @-@ 1 / 0@@ 40@@ 6@@ it@@ .html &gt; was successfully checked as XHTML 1.0 Transitional . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Tor@@ o , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from there , the responsibility was handed over and the letters became more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories , &quot; he as@@ sures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waits for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was opposed to his will at the bre@@ ast@@ feeding of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work lat@@ chers was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working positions and services that were generated in the communities in which they were found . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president , who then saw the presence of the present people , was guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the popular congregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to dis@@ rupt it , they also stopped to p@@ aved the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other businesses . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
they were divided into spare parts .
&quot; without the future prospects , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
nin@@ ety @-@ nine killed the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a hind@@ ran@@ ce person , yet he gives the lies he told him . &quot;
they tor@@ tured him for ten years .
&quot; for 65 years in pension , it is not because it is lacking in power , but because it is bitter . &quot;

young people of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with issues that are important for them . they do through hip @-@ hop thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , we have been working on a mobile audio studio to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups of song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is increasing that the young participants in talks on topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever they are in mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where nearly two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey , as is important to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences through globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always know the languages of the First Nations . &quot;

&quot; the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ olly from the North@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in in@@ scription , as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth .
&quot; this is the day , where you will hear our cry &quot;
&quot; because we have lost our way in life as a youth , &quot;
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and go ahead as well as our youth . &quot;
&quot; thus , they can do what they are destined for the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the comments section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes a contribution and adds the verse in sil@@ ben@@ sement ( which is published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

&quot; in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , close to the entrance Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( me@@ adow ) , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic Models of dishes &quot; &quot; ) from each dish , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ days of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; with Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the Blogger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos published this unusual twist with the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new with plastic strips decorated with plastic strips as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in this case , a Kais@@ s @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile @-@ stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a cell stand .
we also made this part of the exhibition at Tokyo Metro Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comp@@ ass .
&quot; some cell phones and mobile phones allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , I@@ kur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my cell with salmon . &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest cell stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; more bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # me@@ adow , you can find it on twitter . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the exposure of the restaurant industry , such as with the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime

&quot; in reports of foreign and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mix@@ ists and Get@@ ö@@ pers regularly appear only in statistics . however , these are not reflected in the extent of the human tragedy that brings this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the mour@@ ning or the con@@ greg@@ ations that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone @-@ finding in hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican News Portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ oning a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning to live &quot; with the drug trade ) , which aims to give these victims a voice and tell stories about people who were in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many municipalities have to drive a lot of kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; changing life &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Gu@@ adal@@ upe , a father who searches secret gra@@ ves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; and Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing for the task we have made to go and go to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Gu@@ adal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Maria Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15 he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , they have no income . &quot;
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t get paid off because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where are we supposed to come here ?
the editors of &quot; ap@@ pr@@ a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community conflicts , fra@@ gi@@ lity and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , regardless of what form they appear : &quot;
&quot; for some years , illness and sensation journalism have been known for some years now . &quot;
&quot; I have gone to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the pages with pictures , which actually only origin@@ ate from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or acts of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who resi@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
&quot; I can &apos;t be in@@ different , or consider this as normal . &quot;
she continues :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( german : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is , as if they dist@@ ort those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have something to happen . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic .
&quot; it is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified , that they were &quot; up@@ di@@ vin@@ ous . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to convince themselves that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , when they are not stir@@ red and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : like a family with threats , &quot; she describes how armed criminals cle@@ ars money from their business until they did not only destroy the business , but also had torn their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are from each other , the better . &quot;
they concluded their report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kidn@@ apped or killing you . &quot;
&quot; I have asked myself in these terrible days , if we@@ eping my deep@@ est feelings would dis@@ solve , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten kids of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence drawn by violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , their parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , s@@ own potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies living with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for the whole life of violence , and who had to learn to live . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; as Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders to public safety and government of the United States government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to average 8.5 kill@@ ings per day . &quot;
these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines . this project reminds us of those we cannot forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ oning a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 created the data journalism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trade , which has tor@@ tured the country over the past four decades . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words , &quot;
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages that he links , contain images that violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift up a rum@@ or , or expose a fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time appeared ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the village of S@@ ange in the East of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and exploded . there were 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank truck fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; official representatives described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ ashing houses , including a movie nearby , which was full of people who looked at the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ More photos of the incident form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of disgu@@ ised bodies that are ri@@ pen@@ ed on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was written several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
eye witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and b@@ ushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; nobody stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only based on satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture emerg@@ es from the DR Congo , as it fal@@ sely described as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as a receipt for mass@@ acres . &quot;
&quot; a step further further bring personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely , the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the picture of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning report published by the United Nations , those who were able to escape strikes , rape , and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , which summari@@ zed these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to portra@@ y this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , which called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed this statement , but had not taken the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false data
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ ements reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from everywhere around the world .

&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an abu@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand , on the one hand , expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blogger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted to del@@ ta , since the photos were used . &quot;

&quot; the Myanmar government published a judgement on what it was &quot; inten@@ tionally f@@ lowed news and photos , international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judgment , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Speech can operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups in order to suggest that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and other ( which often is common by Bur@@ mes@@ an nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein in 2012 admitted that monks and politicians were involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
&quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and at the time of this publication , the picture remains in it . &quot;
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article of 2014 about students who were killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic @-@ speaking neighbour of An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expres@@ sly stated that the image is not origin@@ ating from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later in connection with the massacre of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the picture of the DR Congo emerged , provided with this Twit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that were pres@@ umed in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a cover for the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with that were not attacked in any religious context .
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that allegedly had been written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , the discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be wrong . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the picture taken from the DR Congo , the organisation of Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were dist@@ anced . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in Grau ) , Tin@@ tin also points out , but are no longer fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have pic@@ file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared first clearly after the original view of 2010 , the image may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong subjects or frames ( frames ) , which go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the creation of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the hei@@ rs of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how to use images related to these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tiny people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that the rejection of images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent representations in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests , but what can be used in the context or absolutely abu@@ sive way . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to offer language fans a choice of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
&quot; such words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these uns@@ ett@@ able words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ t@@ mes@@ a ) .
but everyone resi@@ sts stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes some context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog , you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Mus@@ h@@ room for your parents in recognition of how about you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - Conven@@ i@@ ence or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after being war@@ med in the sun in cold days .
in Birds your own words from his blog about :
&quot; they dist@@ ort other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you affect how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site even more of these &quot; &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;

&quot; after a statement of the disaster relief from Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water resi@@ du@@ es in some areas slowly went back . &quot;
health and hygiene of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and loving girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trusted her my four years old daughter , she trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we call even par@@ ole for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umb@@ rel@@ las and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other channels slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separated me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built themselves in their imagination . &quot;
they de@@ vis@@ e me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim . but somehow we all put all into the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in it , are de@@ formed . &quot;
to prevent mis@@ use of this form ( by bots etc . ) .
I don &apos;t stand alone .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what images do you think of it when you think about it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in Western imagination , religion is extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these pictures in the 1970s . &quot;
but these pictures still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood will continue to ste@@ er them . &quot;
&quot; I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry , and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty nar@@ ra@@ tives dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ ra@@ tively over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ ra@@ tives fail to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scarf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ ra@@ tives we@@ aken Muslim women to guide movements for change .
&quot; it looks at the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , who were brought in with slave ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this nar@@ ra@@ tively , our collective imagination has been so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children will become the target of anti @-@ Semi@@ tic attacks and sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ ra@@ tives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the Nar@@ ra@@ tives of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are in the highest degree &quot; various &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;

&quot; at that time , when Khan remembered the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ignor@@ ant Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now ir@@ reversible Muslim and American ?

&quot; there are hundreds of eminent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists who strive to combat widespread lies about Islam . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was only born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of an pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be seen , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my friend , my neighbour , my rock in the fire see that I am Muslims if it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the sole ritual with my daughter , when I wi@@ den her in my arms and her the Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil that you can &apos;t see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; it is the image of her that I close my eyes : n@@ ano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Kor@@ anic with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which can almost be turned out . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims there is how they taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that has been colon@@ ized for centuries - by an &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; &quot; which a company founded with the name of honor of British East Asia , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ asch@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an was we@@ eping around his family in India dominated by Kash@@ mir , family that he could not close to his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
it means to know that the first air@@ plane bomb of history has been raised over a century over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an indi@@ an , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he was the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;

&quot; it means to remember that a four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops , who were scattered over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy bears the United States and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that before four@@ teen hundred years the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; an American woman , a Pakistani woman , a Kash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple con@@ jun@@ ctions , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ ra@@ tives of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care about my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim regi@@ str@@ ates , which began with President Bush and wi@@ dened by President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .

we are too deeply dar@@ ed to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous bil@@ ingual prints we have in our news@@ letters . &quot;
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which attempts to capture our common identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;

but I &apos;m concerned because of this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
&quot; they are expon@@ enti@@ ally grown , because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other &quot; .
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet been given ; now they have ma@@ stered great areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and history , which I was not aware of when I was so old , as it now is my daughter , but today I have made me an invisible Muslim . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that make our humanity , a story may lie , where someone is made a &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously acting the &quot; others &quot; ; as it did my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we did not have any president , the chocolate cake , while he already had broken @-@ up countries and &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already implemented events since 2015 , the risk that small and non @-@ small languages cannot be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , embrace diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t need to forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated with &quot; listening to &quot; these events instead , &quot; listening to value , to make sense . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this format , story@@ telling is first published in their own language and then translate or explain it in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional history story@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and their representation will lead to the audience . &quot;
&quot; they call laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this turn , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for their country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ ak@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of Has@@ en and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after he explained the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ ak@@ ara asked : &quot; how is it to talk to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad grin he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
they have listened !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organise their own story@@ telling . &quot;

&quot; it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano P@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la deu@@ da ) , and the National Assembly of the Church of Puerto Ric@@ os . &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ mark of the debt also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people Puerto Ric@@ os demands that the politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities responsible for debt are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a cable committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm commitment to our working conditions , which is in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will press and supp@@ ress .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os refuses to pay for debt which is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not integrated into the state @-@ owned territory of the USA - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an NGO independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law of state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; from outside , measures will be denied without the participation and conviction of citizens , to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; Nacht@@ wache for Light and Truth . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has done for an open net . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture held in Berlin , devoted itself to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available here licenses , contains a number of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is said : &quot;
&quot; this book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what the real cost is associated with . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on site to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create something out of our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release , and who want to know him in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own fate , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of occasionally extreme beliefs ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital activities has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el was based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted by individuals on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and put them aware of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a decisive role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ rew , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment transferred to the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes were fores@@ een as the work , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross @-@ cross of numerous civili@@ zations and here mel@@ ted Greek @-@ Roman architecture with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public , as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call its name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in prison . &quot;
I have learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without having actually held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a letter which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book a year .
&quot; they smug@@ gled the texts to him , when she visited him and translated them out of the Arabic language . &quot;
the book is available free of charge .

the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment in which we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
&quot; and I , in every detail of your voice , and words &quot;
&quot; I have a passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes are saying goodbye
and I have another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I turn back to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; in order to rec@@ laim all the moments , &quot;
and over your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I am sending myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote : &quot;

&quot; Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case , when a member of the government returned after half of his sentence in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants in 2010 . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public money from Moz@@ ambique &apos;s airports , the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za , between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately called for his re @-@ setting to the company , what happened on April 19 then . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic , which gave the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company had no disciplinary proceedings after his arrest . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in view of the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we have to know is that the company also has to initiate a disciplinary procedure against the disp@@ arities .
&quot; the company was silent , however , and promp@@ ted no reasonable legal steps to use the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent guy , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and had half of them . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid presentations and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but as he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped harm . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is to be paid for his silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director does not share any moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he ins@@ ult@@ ed him , I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that he has already ins@@ ult@@ ed the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the mor@@ als and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only served by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state , as if it had become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible monetary source and the state itself , this man has become tired that was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the prime minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is heard : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only for the first independent president , but also as sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of selling his own country for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . it changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is criminal at the same time .

the Bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ ell@@ fish .
&quot; by jo@@ e.@@ tim@@ ber@@ wolf on February 6 , 2014 at 6 : 00 am &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network adopted their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word still is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adj@@ ective &quot; Indi@@ ans . &quot; &quot;
Facebook cens@@ zes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or pedal sap@@ pers ( in bur@@ mes@@ an scrip@@ ture ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network .
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely dis@@ appo@@ inting con@@ not@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight hate language in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically provo@@ ke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about his use , have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ switch ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar oat &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; but he had asked his friends in a spiritual way , if they knew how he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a word game . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ook is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
it automatically filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to Fac@@ ech@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to analyze the post carefully and check it by checking the words below . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( columns ) . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists are spreading hate language , a rather good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ise their nationalism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate language , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of whi@@ st@@ les often is a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
... &quot; when I was aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; to cens@@ ze such words , only more hatred is brought within the various communities . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they only had a little more respect for the 15 million people , which had a great turnover , it would be great . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users can now laugh about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ posts , which contained no hate language , but still removed : &quot;
with permission .
the bur@@ mes@@ an text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch a pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; only to try out if Facebook is the post removed , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; screen@@ shot , with permission . &quot;
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate language in social networks is to heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;

&quot; but instead of cens@@ ating the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running in context than on code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;

the children &apos;s to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law that should prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the acceptable age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ Persian ad Mahar@@ aj , a group representing the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere with the age of age , age not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contrac@@ ting partner of the UN Child Rights Convention , the min@@ ors than , each person under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married with 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys under 19 were married . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that endeav@@ oured to aboli@@ sh laws for children , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children before they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubt whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of 2017 , the bill against Child Rights was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one that contained itself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the president of the country has to appro@@ ve and proc@@ laim the law . &quot;

&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against Child Rights was adopted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and none of them decided against it . &quot;
&quot; after he was appointed to the Senate before the Senate , the draft can now become law . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who dressed a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary talk that has vei@@ led the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the pa@@ ws are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson believed it was definitely long enough to finish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived : &quot;

&quot; today , the design to change the sp@@ ouse network was decided on 9 June 2017 . &quot;

&quot; before months , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to dis@@ solve his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the Attorney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said that it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wanted to address the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Vor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; rather sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion as general , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace when we , instead of talking of the problem , that the state , our daughters , would be able to simply talk about it , that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ bo@@ iled men who are in advantage , would you be willing to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children before in different stages legal or still the norm , although there are laws they say . &quot;

&quot; after we heard the news ( about the block of Wikipedia ) , we set up everything from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alised and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to look at least all the Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wiki@@ pedi@@ a.org themselves . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and only for screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation of nature .

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around him , never satisfied . they were bl@@ urred with poorly positioned motives and well @-@ washed colors . &quot;
this motiv@@ ates him to wear a camera and try to dig the situation .
&quot; at that time , he was still a child . &quot;
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal as an animal world to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nept@@ une &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described Facebook as it helps him achieve this top @-@ class position in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . &quot;
&quot; I was at home just at home when she called me Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River a le@@ op@@ ard would be . &quot;
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese nature , and wants to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as fri@@ ghtening as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood by face to face from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when the king of the bush appeared . &quot;
&quot; in order to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to take photographs of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ aa@@ z K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care to pronoun@@ ce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they should respect the husband due to social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should preserve the norm in life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a sh@@ ady court and exp@@ elled from her family and the village community after having responded to a married relative with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also not to name their names is also common among men . however , they have far less money to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health workers and house@@ wives , came to a unique club and thus became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the fin@@ alities of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and uses for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s hei@@ rs up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and leads to this club . &quot;
&quot; they report about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women , and at the same time they have become ambass@@ adors of the change . &quot;
&quot; the first video , which showed the Roh@@ ini in its discussion , acted by women who do not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she has decided for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
&quot; the name of her hus@@ bands is not to pronoun@@ ce loud , is a custom that she must maintain all duties and never questioned . &quot;
&quot; schei@@ f - Nov 7th 2016 , 9 : 52@@ am &quot;
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman , who does not hold this , is regarded as a secret , as woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband so far , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was ended .
&quot; my husband , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they all asked , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her hus@@ bands over her lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ wel from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women should never be able to pronoun@@ ce the name of her hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked
&quot; a woman was so shy that she knew only before the whole exercise , and another decided to release all the infected fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ aline of having broken with an ancient br@@ inger , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name her hus@@ bands in the name . &quot;
and they held their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put her into the head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; as her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed her , she got scared and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ened in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the foreh@@ ead that shows the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women need to show women that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ir @-@ red dot , if he did it . &quot;
&quot; he laugh@@ ed , and I listened to him to wear him . &quot;
&quot; the other women do not have ceased , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves to do it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip to any discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure the women make sure what could be heard , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last few months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties are tied to our hus@@ bands , never so honestly . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things no@@ isy , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion group , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta to wear a wide shirt about a trousers , but they did not dare . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion on the benefits of their own clothes choice , morality connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini &apos;s own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion group , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
&quot; so far , we have made little steps . &quot;
&quot; some women rehear@@ sed it a few times , but then listened to the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two women continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear zinc red on their foreh@@ ead now .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the wed@@ ges for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they sit in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
every one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I &apos;m also .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we do .
we are sitting in the same boat .

&quot; photo : Anders Bol@@ in / Flickr , CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Mal@@ awi . &quot;
&quot; one of the victims was found , and a part of the organs had been removed . &quot;
two men were arrested and the result was that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi were used .
&quot; there will be the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a man @-@ headed man can bring gold to old or riches , declared the police spokesperson of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on smooth @-@ headed men in Moz@@ ambique have been registered .
&quot; a further group , the goal of land@@ ings for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in South Africa to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;

&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ inations were executed . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that local police have already followed the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the cat @-@ headed men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of smooth @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for pres@@ um@@ ably dis@@ beli@@ ever ritu@@ als , has given cultural motives and is given by the traditional sham@@ an , according to which the victims in the head might have power , according to which the victims in the head might have power . &quot;
&quot; in the last few days , three men were killed with hair fall problems in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blogger &apos;s arms Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Moz@@ ambique faces : &quot;

the following version is published within the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community , after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that requires democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and a spokesman told , &quot; &quot; it is not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China will continue to release calls from the international community to release Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the pair in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .

&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June , in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway ( EN )
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into sto@@ cking , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government ha@@ sten@@ ed that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon ship@@ ments to China , since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union ( EN )
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ a of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us to release Li@@ us as described in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits , they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;

&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities will not only allow Li@@ u to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to interv@@ ene and make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel and access to medical care of its choice , to which they have claimed according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally . &quot;

Germany Harb@@ ors &gt; &gt; Germany
&quot; the German government spokesperson Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin , hoping Li@@ u &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese president Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns about whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada Cape Verde
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care to Li@@ u and give it the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to contact anyone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :

France French Gui@@ ana
&quot; in a statement on June 29 , the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore his wife and his family should contact him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information if France will eventually take it out . &quot;
Taiwan ( Republic of Korea )
&quot; the Council of continental issues in Taiwan demanded China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic People &apos;s Party , also called on to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dal@@ ai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dal@@ ai Lama , showed himself very worried in an explanation on June 28 , about Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for whom he had been severely punished , had led to a more harmon@@ ious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn could have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moving and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he under@@ lined that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to &quot; turn the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and op@@ enings to create this valuable country , one ce@@ ases to say that we finally have no country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight in front of the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , as cities which are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old Lei@@ der emerg@@ es from the author@@ itarian rulers who pret@@ end to be demo@@ crats , leave the twisted logic because they are better suited to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am had given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Judi@@ ci@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ responses . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng urges Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point , as long as it was paid to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore . &quot;

read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore would rather be a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ even important , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he promised Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is no country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , who is the leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ emic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , very embarrass@@ ing ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what a@@ waits me - whether I agree or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , Member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes , correctly and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am &apos;s arguments :
&quot; if you have any questions , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is no country , we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is both land and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the Cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Singap@@ ore@@ ans do their military service , they only defend their city , but not their country ? &quot;
who has to pay off our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the Journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the affir@@ mation , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ ore@@ ans ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defence of the country , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your residence or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question asked me most is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I replied . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 , I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his conversation partner , asking for personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication then follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook for anger if they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little to us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack if they are travelling .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; Americans , on the other hand ... &quot;
&quot; when I was 20 years ago , I began to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ les on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons in us !
same @-@ sex marriage has been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are poli@@ te .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot;
Canada is also regarded as the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much . &quot;
it would be nothing if you would like to change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; means to be di@@ lig@@ ent - like the good @-@ minded , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; to be harm@@ less , is to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to earn attention . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own matters .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm @-@ heart@@ ed , open friend@@ liness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has published a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which took power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to reg@@ ain the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what prec@@ epts him his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expres@@ sly politically , the music video refers to the ongoing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
IPTC : caption Dre@@ dg live at the Greenfield Festival in Interlaken ( Switzerland ) on June 13th 2009 . IPTC : Copyright Notice Copyright by Shelley Jambresic .
the video of the song was a huge success .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists watched the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
have a look at these recordings of the video that have per@@ sist@@ ently followed in some of the political themes that have per@@ sist@@ ently pursued Thailand over the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provis@@ ional constitution , which gives the Supreme Commander of the He@@ eres absolute decision on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; 11 . rule : &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program to &quot; &quot; change &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics of the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that monitors online content and individuals who are accused of being denied the mon@@ archy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a stri@@ fe against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty of Maj@@ esty ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was established in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax relief . &quot;
&quot; the video will even be shown how people are thrown into a black van , before entering into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should ins@@ ult the mon@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the band showed members of the band , who had already used the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute from Pan@@ em , &quot; who was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during protests in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; post a message , in answer to the article &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ aboli@@ c war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern subur@@ bs in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ at@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ sch@@ asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet sides in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ asen are living in the area . &quot;
&quot; such settlements are also called &quot; &quot; ghost towns &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 5,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kow@@ kas , are symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult to stop this .
&quot; this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all the community . &quot;
now there is only a p@@ aved road with remaining spl@@ end@@ or @-@ buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
&quot; in the gh@@ ost@@ ly city of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty people live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in other villages it looks similar . &quot;

&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
&quot; the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend , and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear . &quot;
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

Gal@@ ina monthly rent is just nine dollars .

&quot; on the way to cross the migrants , which cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink Bri@@ ll base and gold coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bears . &quot;
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
&quot; in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage . &quot;
&quot; there is no sign for the hotel , but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez told the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast , they begin to cry : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? .
&quot; at the time it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy medicines that they can &apos;t pay , they mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m that is exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a very short time . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ om Africa was a suitable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans come together to travel together and that Afri@@ cans already talk to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he replies , smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez told her guests send her often text messages when they have gone to gre@@ et them or to report her about the course of her journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family were included in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants too expensive .
&quot; he started to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mostly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I have crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling by Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to black@@ out money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he was asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a lonely , has offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; some months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , travellers consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; today , a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she heads in her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old . &quot;

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter user Acquis@@ ition → Posted →
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10th , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi were given a phone noti@@ fying where they have the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but k@@ ò@@ n@@ th@@ ed the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had installed the app to exchange news with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the message of the police , the app was able to determine and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the blocking porno@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ phi@@ es and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used in a variety of ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even hack@@ ers capable to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal it from it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China is mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South , the reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet accounts . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
notify me of follow @-@ up comments by email . notify me of new posts by email .
&quot; if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity through the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; &quot; China &quot; &quot; ( Analytik Jena Recei@@ pt ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ product from which the software can lift the key requirement of a Windows operating system , and thus get un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the spread of illegal contents .
&quot; all governmental branches , authorities and the party related institutions including universities and research institutions are required to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report of Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published an ordin@@ ance on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of other crimes , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series of &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at and imagine that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has been dissolved , and the truth is revealed , which is clearly recogni@@ zable , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes her name all honor .
one who has defeated in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything goes beyond death . &quot;
&quot; you will realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to build stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of security forces form@@ ulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he presented his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ orten the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all the districts sought after , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city that is stuff@@ ed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things were so@@ othing after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning . &quot;
I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice heard through silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we were united to a magnificent picture that ful@@ fills my expectations full and ful@@ fil@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but it is just not interested in the righteous . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice , after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to talk : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &apos; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only brave enough to cry if we are not near . &quot;
his face @-@ filled eyes set up on me .
&quot; and you &apos;re sad to look at me , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was at my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , van@@ ity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my thing as I said , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret the word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; he is in solit@@ ary and his father , equally with him . &quot;
&quot; his father is equally with him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed stat@@ ure is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; a psychological torture , which I was subjected to months for months . &quot;
I went through the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything that I wear with me . &quot;
&quot; after that , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells . &quot;

&quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner , and must immediately set me without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I went back to an old @-@ tried communication method : with the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; sth@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after long hes@@ itation , he answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a prominent man of middle ages , who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no mark@@ edly visible fac@@ ades can be seen , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all answers are linked to their existence .
maybe he was moved into one of the big cells .
maybe he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to sell all these cro@@ ws that are lab@@ elled at the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time , the cri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of dis@@ belief until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the horror in person : Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13 pro@@ ver of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interrog@@ ated .
&quot; in order to protect the state security from us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al ex@@ tor@@ tion card and revealed the close eye view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is no country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ t@@ orium and meet on Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and a mu@@ ddy man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that det@@ ain him : &quot; my boy , you are young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end anyway . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; I have used it to me , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer tell exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to be punished , even though I had nothing done to earn this punishment . &quot;
a penalty in all its diversity .
his command is to rip myself as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
&quot; it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak . &quot;
your exec@@ ution@@ er rose up to your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you cannot keep your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry was not enough for him , why they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a g@@ arbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables in each other , in order to present us that , from their point of view , to present a great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still on the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the hen re@@ marked the cooling , and found no pleasure in it , why it was next to an electri@@ cally charged bar . &quot;
&quot; power flows through my whole body , enough to feed my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power leader . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to go back to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which seemed to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , as@@ sh@@ ri@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry about dre@@ ad@@ ful wor@@ ries . &quot;

that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .

&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; once he swal@@ lowed his canvas , even to his computer , and again on his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine spotted lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which since 1967 belongs to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel saw his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had forced himself to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( for example : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years H@@ da@@ ib has been a passionate activist , who faces the conservative majority and questioned her old @-@ tested opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , he also urges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with 25 years of age , H@@ da@@ ib has seen himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking , and he can feel the dis@@ astro@@ us consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he doesn &apos;t open it openly , he defe@@ ats a special reluct@@ ance against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ ib looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian P@@ oultry of the Second Generation , &quot; he said himself even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own living conditions , &quot; H@@ da@@ ib stresses . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think that because I am a person , &quot; &quot; while he sh@@ ook in water in water N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the slo@@ ping of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ ps of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when looking at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Interior of Jord@@ ani@@ ens said a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MEPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert hall . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CNN , the MP and former press spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism to question the well @-@ established legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive supp@@ orter of human rights , &quot; which continues to apply for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not just a sei@@ z@@ ure rhet@@ oric , but in fact a clearly cryst@@ alli@@ ating reality in Jordan reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib ru@@ ined traditional sex men into wom@@ b by ab@@ duc@@ ting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch out to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; she is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , the number of &apos; honor@@ ary kill@@ ings &apos; has increased - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor@@ ary kill@@ ings in 2016 reached its peak ; however , the institutional infrastructure is still lacking in order to support women who tried murder or domestic violence to support appropriate ways . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for breaking up from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of internal violence must be held in prison , and for their release it is often a long @-@ term bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for doing not shy away from issues , which are long as t@@ abo@@ o in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he is not able to separate his music , which is full of explicit read@@ ings on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; to me , politics is mis@@ led , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; , H@@ da@@ ib took the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
IPTC : caption Dre@@ dg live at the Greenfield Festival in Interlaken ( Switzerland ) on June 13th 2009 . IPTC : Copyright Notice Copyright by Shelley Jambresic .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse repe@@ ats itself often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the songs , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market where one can get what you want - whether faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ geneity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still have been cens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib took an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn down , twisted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a modified version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ ib is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ its , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ do , who was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph later , could not write openly about homosexu@@ ality in eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , didn &apos;t have anything with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on free speech and that progressive voices will be sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service took several former govern@@ ors and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the reason that they were critical of the problems that were deeply rooted in the country with the deeply rooted corruption . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ ib - is made up of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ ib , like millions of other Arabs , dre@@ amed of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to see them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be accompanied by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster munitions and on artificial nature . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is , H@@ da@@ ib will continue to carry out resistance and also resist@@ ing resistance . &quot;

&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the fancy hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , has led to more and more regular citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts on each other to show who can create the ex@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy school , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of being able to obtain a training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser , which enables them to find work . &quot;
&quot; it is motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered by dozens of young people , that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; the school offered special training workshops before the school year , and reported about some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the modified version of the article &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothetical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015 &quot;
why do we write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; it is not yet much more important , people who have pushed themselves out , aff@@ ection aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; precisely this question went on to the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aci@@ ón ( letter to reconciliation ) , which encouraged young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace agreement was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in front of the colum@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Guer@@ ri@@ l@@ la@@ k@@ konen , who lived in illegal camps for many years , had been subjected to war rhet@@ oric and around the clock , they must now integrate into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become acc@@ ustom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases , must now take into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian people had to join together and to help the integration process .
and exactly that they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as to welcome them again in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letter to reconciliation was created on the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we love the people we love to write in Valentine &apos;s day thousands of love letters , but those who need them much more . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he continued to share his love with people this year , bre@@ wing the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I &apos;ve never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipal administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , travelled to the camp to personally transfer letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done earlier to meet the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bri@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go in , as next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the bush . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life , someone has written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ g him completely , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else about life as a war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers in front of the fam@@ ine . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside there , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
until now I have learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices :
&quot; for the first time , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion group . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
&quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how social injustice on the whole of the Colom@@ bian people worked . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; these people who had never heard hearing and had no choice right , and to realize that the people I &apos;ve often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings caused by their lives and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote to the example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ ans were proph@@ es@@ ied that after dis@@ arm@@ ing peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to pick up arms and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong to all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be im@@ minent . &quot;
&quot; on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ ens who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months of persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hang@@ s like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ worth over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us what happened in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international headlines several months ago , after reports published that themati@@ sed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of que@@ erer men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina at Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who took susp@@ icious que@@ ens and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; as she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Czech@@ s had experienced the sexual inter@@ course of her country@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the United States last year . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On July 7 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to escape the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital again .
&quot; apparently , some women had received everything and started to cry . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two strokes in my right lung wing . &quot;
OC Media : in which nur@@ ses were you placed - in which men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women . &quot;
&quot; for this , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out as a good man .
I am thank@@ ful for him that he is respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they were absurd demands : some said to me , I have to prove it by running out without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have body size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that not only your family , but the whole Republic . &quot;
&quot; we can &apos;t touch you because you are a fro@@ g woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a stri@@ ck around her neck .
&quot; fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them . &quot;
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with dark@@ ened windows and a license plate with a 95 on it .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something lazy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you bra@@ ided ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the country , but then something unexpected happened . &quot;
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering me , without identification , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the g@@ arbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you do not believe , you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know what hotel you put . you even know your room number .
only to prove you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; but we don &apos;t talk about sexual inter@@ ruption , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still wear in me .
&quot; as I wish , this spiritual barrier cannot be overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is in life , I will do my best to hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really want to look at the person that she remembered from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who are d@@ ort@@ able ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
&quot; for this , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who had saved one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , they are now concent@@ rating on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end , proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood . &quot;
OC Media : are men still gay in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there wouldn &apos;t be much too many . &quot;
&quot; if , then , above all , those who have no rich relatives or those who have been dropped by their relatives to stand up to Kad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there so that they will be able to present them as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; Should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people have not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is it just a guess or did you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just want someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
there was nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them away .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was also involved when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would it not have allowed these people to sh@@ ave themselves ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
&quot; in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob . &quot;
&quot; I think , before 2003 I was already known in quite Gros@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately thrown back into the stone age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops . &quot;
the security ministry of the Sh@@ aria never has a hair curved to me .
&quot; in front of the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never ins@@ ult@@ ed .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase &quot; &quot; K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; Sp@@ otte is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; they often say to children , if they are funny about the sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes , because they believed they were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never ins@@ ult@@ ed me , never ch@@ ased and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period take place ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily on the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; those who had learned and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with suspicion . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic grew steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for it for a long time .
&quot; I have discovered these people , when I ab@@ ide a flood sor@@ bed . &quot;
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; so nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no co@@ ils in them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the cab@@ ard@@ ines who have the Russians , who are in the whole planet - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear anything . &quot;
so many men come from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims living in the mos@@ que and fast@@ ing during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think about transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than one year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself .
local groups warn against an increase of self @-@ mor@@ als within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there is a strong rise in self @-@ mor@@ den . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : permission .
&quot; the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ash@@ amed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to be able to raise the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups working in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; on YouTube , the video kept the moments when he had lit himself . &quot;
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists in the place warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing together : they were all family fathers who were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and incap@@ able of fulfilling their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which most of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to maintain its livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi mon@@ archy took over power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow only slowly , and the local population only gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime is denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also has built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to destroying the devast@@ ation caused in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fishing and pal@@ ms industry . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , told that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activist , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic per@@ si@@ sts and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process is a combination of a high number of ethnic per@@ si@@ ders and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; since functional and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will be depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of the national Resistance of Young Arabs , and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside of their homeland , Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names are not tolerated in the workplace , because speaking of Arabic language or carrying Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; in view of the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i must end@@ ure , human rights activists strike alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and taking note of it .

the following article is a revised version of the statement released by Ay@@ om@@ id Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say I &apos;m not a feminist , many women react to women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even laid well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education as men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to doing what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms are still making sure that women sooner or later come to a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still spreading across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I am double and triple below .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black C@@ is women , on black women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women should come together to &quot; &quot; lift their voices and &quot; &quot; to sing &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it in addition to sexu@@ alized violence an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women on a two @-@ fold manner .
&quot; or , that black women and women of other ethni@@ cities and her@@ edit@@ ary sor@@ ties earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want that all women , all men and all human beings do not have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose centre is the white woman who refuses to take into account injus@@ tices in their thinking , which refer to gender as well as on the skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always denied me and countless other black women .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is a de@@ mented and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , to advance their ego@@ centric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to revi@@ ve them . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different information a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release me full and completely from femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life neither passed nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine devoted to international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here . &quot;
&quot; again , Nabil Mus@@ a returned to Iraq last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq , a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we no longer have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia of Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of their work lies on persec@@ uted , little respected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ay@@ ans women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; the we@@ eping women &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ sels in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of Kur@@ dist@@ an . the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ lessness ) that reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner , who had become violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time had passed and the police said that her statement would be laid to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , the acute ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez has nothing to do with her . &quot;
&quot; some days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad . &quot;
to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; in general , if women have an ad in general , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also finan@@ cially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , report to the prosecution authorities . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z , researcher on gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are alarm@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads went to the district prosec@@ utor 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 adverti@@ sements because of domestic violence in peace education . here , 86 % of the ads came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women were talking about psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; to any woman who is ref@@ using in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2014 , there are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s suicide is not an own off@@ ence , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s authorities can not be adequ@@ ately documented how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then came to her . this should always be regre@@ tt@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos . but two years , she en@@ du@@ red the psychological violence on her part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner has mi@@ stre@@ ated them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Yo te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with mental abuse .
&quot; after all , her wealthy partner managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads among the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a process against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ predictable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , lack of implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the H@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Fear ) . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ ini@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ence , and to pun@@ ish it as it is in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the law text has been changed in some respects to also win the MEPs for the law which feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay , will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original draft had fores@@ een , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , who have to carry out the victims of violence at the present time , if they simply merely provide ad and receive a safe place to stop the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial means :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment as part of inter @-@ human relationships is seen . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as a normal normal . &quot;
&quot; in view of these facts , it is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rators are punished . &quot;
we need to equi@@ p a long ad until the treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . &quot;
notify me of follow @-@ up comments by email .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victims again .
&quot; the string of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after ban on a newspaper continued to be attacked
&quot; this website has been blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information Minister , &quot; &quot; read Az@@ am@@ n on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the Iranian authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an@@ ate . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried before court , but later returned . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , Oman is governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ibn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had put his father , S@@ aid ibn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , he suff@@ ers , alongside his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Defence , Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme Council for planning and president of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces , especially the domestic secret services , public liber@@ ties , including press freedom , restri@@ cting and conscientious obj@@ ectors , independent journalists , blogger and other activists , inti@@ mid@@ ating and imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights , including activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow for the freedom of press in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , held a article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties tie the hands of justice &quot; in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading &quot; &quot; High @-@ level parties tie the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by ISS before the special department and arrested the security forces on his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS adopted the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed on in@@ definite time after the information minister had given the order that &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 in Mas@@ kat , the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the court sentenced three journalists to prison sentences , and also ordered the newspaper &apos;s final closure . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned among other things because of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a public ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es at the height of 3000 US dollars ( 78@@ 00 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to one year imprisonment and a fine fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after receiving the use of an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order .
&quot; on 22 August 2016 , Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Court of App@@ eal spoke to Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released from the central prison on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues in prison where he has served his one @-@ year sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the Court &apos;s decision to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper seems to be exposed to attacks by the Russian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement that was extended by the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; closure for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Security signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister decided another time against the decision of the App@@ eals Court to allow the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman in recent days the press freedom was viol@@ ated .
&quot; further violations include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Australian authorities :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promp@@ tly and un@@ condi@@ tionally un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
&quot; 2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their jobs ; &quot;
&quot; 3 . protecting the freedom of freedom in the country , and &quot;
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and without fear of ex@@ termination measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blogger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring countries by promoting the freedom of opinion and freedom of expression and the right to gather peac@@ efully together and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Figure by agreement &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack of global health care , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing , which cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build up own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Sam@@ bia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a post doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched himself on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of media about this research . &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just launched a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
GM : what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no fundamental research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being a maker . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;

is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people coming back or moving here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards developed in developed countries . it costs much money to have continuous supply with electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at every age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and inf@@ ectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often , there are limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines can only make reference to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the USA to India : &quot; &quot; open Source &quot; &quot; seed producers change global food production &quot;
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about potential environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant , which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only made by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many Sal@@ at@@ eries he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that it could not continue to be used for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents are not only suitable for single varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or c@@ anned leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more such patents have been registered for more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ els . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts have been concerned about food safety and the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mort@@ on always bre@@ eds a salad , but it has become more and more difficult for his work because his work is more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if in a river there are a b@@ oul@@ der , around which I have to p@@ add@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new salad , because all the characteristics are patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he also joined a movement , which is becoming increasingly bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eder ) . &quot;
&quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have been bred and eaten red Roman sal@@ at in the greenhouse &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; of the station . there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space . &quot;

&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds like this , as if the movement from the IT sector would come from and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; Se@@ eds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , providing alternatives to copyright protected software . &quot;
&quot; it has been called into life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and can be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ SSI , US bre@@ eders can commit themselves to use other seeds of bred seeds . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to breed their seeds , breeding it to breed their own varieties , and it is not immediately ej@@ ected - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 . &quot;
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Madison and O@@ SSI Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seeds and the ability to breed new plants is important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot;

Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to providing other seed companies free of charge . thus , their approach is to patent seed and plant features . &quot;

&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed because the available gene pool , due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available , constantly shr@@ inks . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ SSI , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are no such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass produced plants such as wheat are still patented as a salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of the point of view
&quot; plants are bred so that they have targeted features - from such circumstances , through which their taste or colour can be improved to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changing conditions are much worse by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts that intellectual property is other bre@@ eders as &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result .
&quot; such protection therefore in@@ hi@@ bits innovation , but encourages them to provide more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees the different : 20 years to wait until a patent expi@@ res , certainly no innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for a long time to breed to plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on , however , is that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; &quot; we do not create the characteristics ourselves . &quot;

a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eders in the US State Oregon and O@@ SSI Executive Board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who bre@@ eds a variety , also raises its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for their cultivation of mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , bre@@ eders breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is opposite .
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such , which are moving on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are patents ) , they create most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either lean them or hold it for too expensive and therefore not worth it or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also the opinion that bre@@ eders would be innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I &apos;m with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than company that pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; I always need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors are selling my grades in a couple of years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition , which makes it easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance &quot;
&quot; although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col works on an open source license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SSI commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( provisions for the breeding are different from country to country , hence the O@@ SSI obligation cannot simply be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , states that conventional bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is still not a law ; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed breeding systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over Eastern Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently developing a global alliance for open source &quot; seed systems for the planned next year of the official start @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups ( among them Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has put together a database on seed and bi@@ odiversity in order to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a network of aid organizations such as the WK Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - has published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a link between the Lu@@ by of O@@ SSI , hoping to see more people soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care of where and how it is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make the people clear@@ er that there is more behind their food . &quot;

af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s started . &quot;
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content on Egyptian users .
&quot; in addition , the situation will be wor@@ sen@@ ed that the cens@@ orship decisions have taken place behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which they can proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants dispute .

&quot; newspapers throughout Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country , and home of numerous postcard designs . &quot;
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school shot , &quot; &quot; Every second day , a police officer was killed in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves smoked pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sent 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , navy and air w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are common@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not normal , &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; this is our way to cry , this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as a journalist not close our eyes before cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper said that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist reported that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 areas are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial office , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discre@@ et , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police , who only sho@@ ots and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it used ?
&quot; in an article on the News Portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra argues against the violence as &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the police unit deployed by the State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police force . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP has been using several reports on ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pris@@ als against the poor communities that should protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux published an article from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explained why the violence in Rio was not established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a gyp@@ sy is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; aber@@ rant spheres . &quot; &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently approximately one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 requested hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these areas have been under siege by rebels controlled areas outside Damascus . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ ni@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the common ones , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ tor@@ ate of the project , Ab@@ o Nabil , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it is now more and more . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ close , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform cand@@ o . &quot;

the initiative is dependent on gener@@ ators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used to supply the gener@@ ators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production of the fung@@ us seeds , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking of siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc . ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will be visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

&quot; forty people died , and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires from 15 to 16 October . this resulted in the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions that spread across the country in the northern and central regions of the country , and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery , only 2017 in Portugal is burned around 500,000 hectares of forest - an area of the Lisbon district . &quot;

&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the Wal@@ nut form , which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government carried out a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity of the case if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continued in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of slightly fire@@ able wood , itself , as in a vi@@ cious circle , gradually spread to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as residents sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so critical that the server could not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users that followed the fires , the website counted more than half a million . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the con@@ quest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan last time with his family during dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother was not so told at that time , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - perhaps even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning gray , the boy should break . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt guar@@ ding . &quot;
the Taliban &apos;s hatred of the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban came near@@ er .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again . &quot;
a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged s@@ acks with mortar , which were heavier than he himself , to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;

&quot; it was really tough , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon front of the open windows so that we do not end at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church twice a day of food in need@@ y need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high inflation rates , but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are catastro@@ phic . &quot;

&quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special recording centers &quot; . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised office in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum , which can still be postpon@@ ed after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation have either reli@@ ed on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
&quot; thus , A@@ shar@@ af was taken . &quot;
but his un@@ restra@@ ined livel@@ iness helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after he had made several years of work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while and a sn@@ ug bit .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Behind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including cutters , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
&quot; in Pad@@ ua , the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Cab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ushi restaurant in Rome . &quot;

&quot; where there is a risk , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also plans plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end , stability and prosperity are at the end . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; Ne@@ ti@@ zen report : draft bills from Egypt enable abor@@ tion of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the release of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen report is an international snap@@ shot , challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament is checking out a draft bill , which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government authority . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks within six months , users must register their full name as well as their identification number within six months . &quot;
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or de@@ priv@@ ation of a criminal deposit .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by six members of the Parliament , is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament , and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of parliament filed a legislative proposal in which the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the president or a high officials would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult of the President , as well as state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , such act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , so legal experts from the Office for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the judgment . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ mine a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he held violence against demonstr@@ ators , who demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who had led to the military coup that led to the escal@@ ation of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a trial . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on the 20th of May , because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on the apparent load of others , including weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;

&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with interrog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; according to the plan , Ben G@@ har@@ bia was supported by the President of the Republic , which was expres@@ sly supported by the President of the Republic , which was expres@@ sly supported by the President of the Republic , according to the plan , by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused of corruption . &quot;
&quot; the document , published on 21 April at Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , raises a light on how the Presi@@ dential plans to support the leg@@ alization situation . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources by article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which journalists en@@ vis@@ aged the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tun@@ is on May 9th , as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the regulations , it is also stated that registration with full re@@ els will be required . &quot;
analysts believe that the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks is to be achieved . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .

&quot; this term is part of a law dating from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government has a list of online services that will allow the government to publish the &quot; &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the law allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data . &quot;
