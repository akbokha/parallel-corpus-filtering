<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American films, studied American music, read American authors and practised his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were keen to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, it is the most important thing to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only increased."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country I've ever lived whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shamanic love letter written about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his narrow allegiance."</seg>
<seg id="15">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in favour of him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won by republican pre-elections, was the highest number one ever achieved by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, bringing people out of the world, a deeply believer person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps world outlook did not correspond with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met us in our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trump Intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity, which I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she is still adapting to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always with a lot of patience and grace to me and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Griffey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">"these people, and the values embodied by them, deepened my love to America."</seg>
<seg id="29">"during Trump's path to nominating republican presidential candidates, they offered me a hold and counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans enrolled over 50 million Americans, mostly whites, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they were either shared with racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"one of my friends, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act on another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most white have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"but one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(Anm. d. Ü.: as much as" "white against all other ethnic groups" "; wordplay from white to the White and Whiplash, which means so much like Schleudertrauma), as it was the big Van Jones, has just killed what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which belief or background should always have, America is welcome everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of the White America of this promise and says: hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America, after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, have my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd responded with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>

<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd roared."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Did Afro-Americans have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO."</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't it your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trump's land, said the message."</seg>

<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds far from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, the La banda de música (music bande) plays in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults with their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome them."</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this was changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they are always laughing and with glossy eyes and play in the chest you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>

<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest landfill site of Asunción in Paraguayan capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with repetitive instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made out of the garbage."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, remembers:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents were working in the trash, the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made out of litter.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>

<seg id="98">"this article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">"as part of an agreement with Global Voices, the re-release happens in the context of a common use of content."</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated in Liberian waters before it was looking for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal offender of this kind in their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything", "Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillaging of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are equal and working together. they exchange information and stand together with each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to detect. thus illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"through the deliberate disrespect of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types should be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, these actions happen in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange licenses of existing licenses, suspicious activity or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fishing in forbidden areas, such as those who suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fish fanatic, where they were on the way and possibly even if they were a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what does that mean that the ships can't sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay for penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consultant firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already-called platform was created to regain the estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, which will lose eight members of the Hish-i network every year because of illegal fishermen who penetrate in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of imaginary names, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-organised control system", "says Long." "previously, a ship could fishing and a land could then say 'You can't walk my port'."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its foundation, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has uncovered criminal networks that distributes fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities, and it has been persecuted and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to his collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing in large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "Bergh says."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships.</seg>

<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to detect illegal vessels that love to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross, "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"for example, some of the ships will turn off their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be localized by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal acts with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's Team of African Nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>

<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only sense criminals, but also deter them."</seg>

<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile reported a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats have been buying more licenses since then."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear annually by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries have joined together, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With safety, the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative working method to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world.

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive voice skills in order to understand the original and active language skills in order to transmit it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general the belief that translators in the target language should not be in the initial language - not in the initial language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as native language, which could make translations into English. this may be attributable to the lack of understanding of translating, cost-reasons or the relatively small number of native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, leave translations in their company internally. then, the Japanese employees, whose knowledge of English skills, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good."</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and enigmatic phrases, which arise through machine translation, show that this technique can still not replace human translators. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints, often used T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with issues that are important for them. they do through hip-hop thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, we have been working on a mobile audio studio to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups of songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the educators David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is increasing that the young participants in talks on topics such as" cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance "or whatever they are in mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section in Westkanada, where nearly two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not explained.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey, as is important to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences through globalization."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always know the languages of the First Nations."</seg>

<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in inscription, as a translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>

<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the todays of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>

<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican News Portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" aponing a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" learning to live "with the drug trade), which aims to give these victims a voice and tell stories about people who were in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project as follows:</seg>

<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>

<seg id="772">Where are we supposed to come here?</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "appra vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, regardless of what form they appear:"</seg>
<seg id="779">"for some years, illness and sensation journalism have been known for some years now."</seg>
<seg id="780">"I have gone to newspaper kiosks every day and see the pages with pictures, which actually only originate from a textbook for criminology or acts of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who resisted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">"I can't be indifferent, or consider this as normal."</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (german: drug dealers) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is, as if they distort those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have something to happen."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"it is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified, that they were" updivinous. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to convince themselves that they remain spared from such tragedies, when they are not stirred and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the main city district: like a family with threats, "she describes how armed criminals clears money from their business until they did not only destroy the business, but also had torn their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of it never goes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the further we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">They concluded their report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they are kidnapped or killing you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I have asked myself in these terrible days, if weeping my deepest feelings would dissolve, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten kids of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, their parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, sown potatoes, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies living with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"but they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for the whole life of violence, and who had to learn to live."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years earlier, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"as Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders to public safety and government of the United States government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office was 3103 murders. this corresponds to average 8.5 killings per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. this project reminds us of those we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" aponing a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político 2015 created the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trade, which has tortured the country over the past four decades."</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the village of Sange in the East of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. there were 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country has been neglected for years and devastated."</seg>

<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>

<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was written several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye witnesses reported drastic atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"however, the numbers could not be confirmed." nobody stayed back to count corpses, "said a resident of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were crushed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only based on satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack remained unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here the picture emerges from the DR Congo, as it falsely described as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:"</seg>

<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>

<seg id="852">"a step further further bring personal comments such as this example falsely, the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the goal of a new testing of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the Puertoriolian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the Old Town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">"it was proclaimed by the grouping" Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la deuda "(Ciudadano Ciudadano Por la Auditoría de la deuda), and the National Assembly of the Church of Puerto Ricos."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the remark of the debt also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people Puerto Ricos demands that the politicians, bankers and government authorities responsible for debt are responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a cable committee without personal interests in public debts, with a firm commitment to our working conditions, which is in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will press and suppress.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ricos refuses to pay for debt which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not find themselves with falling pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available here licenses, contains a number of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"in the introduction, it is said:"</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built, and what the real cost is associated with."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on site to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create something out of our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prison, which he was sitting on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release, and who want to know him in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own fate, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of occasionally extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">"since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital activities has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" Military Police Bassel was based on a "strictly secret" command of the Military Court of his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that it was contacted by individuals on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and put them aware of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment transferred to the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes were foreseen as the work, which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross-cross of numerous civilizations and here melted Greek-Roman architecture with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public, as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"as a result, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call its name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners to use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually held one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a letter which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"they smuggled the texts to him, when she visited him and translated them out of the Arabic language."</seg>

<seg id="1288">"by joe.timberwolf on February 6, 2014 at 6: 00 am"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network adopted their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word still is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indians. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censzes the word "Kalar" or pedal sappers (in burmesan scripture) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely disappointing connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort to fight hate language in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" Kalar "may normally be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about his use, have been censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, the chair is written on Burmesan also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spswitch), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"but he had asked his friends in a spiritual way, if they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by making a word game."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" Healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmesan - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to Facebook's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hook is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook must be analytic before all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">America's strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans-Atlantic security partnership</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write to Facechook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to analyze the post carefully and check it by checking the words below."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(columns)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists are spreading hate language, a rather good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate language, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of whistles often is a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">... "when I was aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked."</seg>

<seg id="1322">America's strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans-Atlantic security partnership</seg>
<seg id="1323">"to censze such words, only more hatred is brought within the various communities."</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support, and so words like" "chair" "or" "peas curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the deleted posts."</seg>

<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs, which are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and uses for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>

<seg id="1480">"they report about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women, and at the same time they have become ambassadors of the change."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, which showed the Rohini in its discussion, acted by women who do not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has decided for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the name of her husbands is not to pronounce loud, is a custom that she must maintain all duties and never questioned."</seg>

<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband so far, wanted to try out at home as it runs."</seg>

<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>

<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husbands over her lips," "says Rohini Pawel from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the Brechen of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women should never be able to pronounce the name of her husbands."</seg>

<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put her into the head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>

<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation artened in violence.</seg>

<seg id="1517">"the other women do not have ceased, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves to do it in some days."</seg>

<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip to any discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make sure the women make sure what could be heard," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last few months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have some things, for example, how our identities are tied to our husbands, never so honestly."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things noisy, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion group, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people it's okay, but some wanted a Salman-Kurta to wear a wide shirt about a trousers, but they did not dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion on the benefits of their own clothes choice, morality connected with the saris and much more, Rohini's own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion group, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will be able to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">"so far, we have made little steps."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women rehearsed it a few times, but then listened to the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear zinc red on their forehead now.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the wedges for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they sit in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I'm also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people about what we're talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He underlined that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice to "turn the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and openings to create this valuable country, one ceases to say that we finally have no country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight in front of the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, as cities which are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old Leider emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic because they are better suited to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the last week of Shanmugam had given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judiciative, our political system really non-responses."</seg>
<seg id="1703">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng urges Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, as long as it was paid to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way to cross the migrants, which cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink Brill base and gold coloured earrings in teddy bears."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">"in the anteroom, there is a parrot in a cage."</seg>
<seg id="1907">"there is no sign for the hotel, but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez told the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast, they begin to cry:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?.</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the time it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy medicines that they can't pay, they massaging them with a balm that is exhausted from the long journey."</seg>

<seg id="1925">"" Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Africans come together to travel together and that Africans already talk to Whatsapp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he replies, smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez told her guests send her often text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family were included in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mostly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I have crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling by Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to blackout money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he was asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a lonely, has offered him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"some months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go."</seg>

<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, travellers consult their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"today, a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>

<seg id="1962">"on July 10th, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the city Urumqi were given a phone notifying where they have the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>

<seg id="1974">"while reporting on digital censorship in China is mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South, the reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; once he swallowed his canvas, even to his computer, and again on his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which since 1967 belongs to them since 1967; the year when Israel saw his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced himself to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyeen (for example: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist, who faces the conservative majority and questioned her old-tested opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he also urges the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with 25 years of age, Hdaib has seen himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking, and he can feel the disastrous consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he doesn't open it openly, he defeats a special reluctance against US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as" Palestinian Poultry of the Second Generation, "he said himself even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own living conditions," Hdaib stresses. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think that because I am a person," "while he shook in water in water Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"in principle, the sloping of lukewarm coffee and the raps of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when looking at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Interior of Jordaniens said a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MEPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert hall."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the MP and former press spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism to question the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as a" progressive supporter of human rights, "which continues to apply for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not just a seizure rhetoric, but in fact a clearly crystalliating reality in Jordan reflected in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib ruined traditional sex men into womb by abducting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch out to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"she is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, the number of 'honorary killings' has increased - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary killings in 2016 reached its peak; however, the institutional infrastructure is still lacking in order to support women who tried murder or domestic violence to support appropriate ways."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for breaking up from the year 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of internal violence must be held in prison, and for their release it is often a long-term bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman has nothing to do."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for doing not shy away from issues, which are long as taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music, which is full of explicit readings on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"to me, politics is misled," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" "Edward Sa'ed", Hdaib took the question of the Palestinian identity. "</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>

<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse repeats itself often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can get what you want - whether faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals still have been censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib took an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to remember that his comments were torn down, twisted and his opinion had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a modified version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuits, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nudo, who was to work on behalf of the caliph later, could not write openly about homosexuality in eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, didn't have anything with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemitic kingdom, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on free speech and that progressive voices will be silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service took several former governors and members of the teacher's association, with the reason that they were critical of the problems that were deeply rooted in the country with the deeply rooted corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the Hdaibs concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - is made up of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreamed of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to see them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be accompanied by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and on artificial nature. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as it is, Hdaib will continue to carry out resistance and also resisting resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2169">"in April 2017, a survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe."</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the fancy hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), has led to more and more regular citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the modified version of the article" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">"this paper investigates the impact of non-take-up for two hypothetical scenarios, namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by €100 per month. IAB-Discussion Paper 20 / 2015"</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"it is not yet much more important, people who have pushed themselves out, affection affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"precisely this question went on to the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo Párraga from the Young Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letter to reconciliation), which encouraged young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla warfare FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace agreement was so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the columbians, however, there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrillakkonen, who lived in illegal camps for many years, had been subjected to war rhetoric and around the clock, they must now integrate into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, must now take into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian people had to join together and to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly that they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter to reconciliation was created on the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we love the people we love to write in Valentine's day thousands of love letters, but those who need them much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he continued to share his love with people this year, brewing the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and to build a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I've never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipal administration of Cali and Leonardo, travelled to the camp to personally transfer letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done earlier to meet the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between, "said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambriches "(a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go in, as next to him on the bed was a MGL pomegate, a deadly weapon in the bush."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he said," "Hello, what do they do?" "he said," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life, someone has written something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hug him completely, and sat down beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else about life as a war. the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers in front of the famine." "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside there, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices:</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the first time, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion group."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"this is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have experienced how social injustice on the whole of the Colombian people worked. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people who had never heard hearing and had no choice right, and to realize that the people I've often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings caused by their lives and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much harm, can teach us something and give a smile and hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote to the example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbians were prophesied that after disarming peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to pick up arms and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all the defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong to all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be imminent."</seg>

<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering me, without identification, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you do not believe, you're in security, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know what hotel you put. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"but we don't talk about sexual interruption, that's a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as I wish, this spiritual barrier cannot be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is in life, I will do my best to hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really want to look at the person that she remembered from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who are dortable?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for this, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had saved one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"most likely, they are now concentrating on family and relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end, proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced through blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are men still gay in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there wouldn't be much too many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, above all, those who have no rich relatives or those who have been dropped by their relatives to stand up to Kadyrov's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there so that they will be able to present them as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people have not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess or did you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just want someone who was imprisoned in Argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was also involved when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">"in Chechnya, I had a Bob."</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, before 2003 I was already known in quite Grosny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to introduce us to" "civilisation", "but ultimately thrown back into the stone age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of the Sharia never has a hair curved to me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a phrase" "Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "Spotte is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"they often say to children, if they are funny about the sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes, because they believed they were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never insulted me, never chased and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period take place?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us per se, but primarily on the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"those who had learned and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic grew steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"at present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreffs, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">"I have discovered these people, when I abide a flood sorbed."</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no coils in them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have those who have the cabardines who have the Russians, who are in the whole planet - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear anything."</seg>
<seg id="2387">So many men come from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims living in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transience to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I'm going to be so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than one year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself.</seg>

<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed for his own helplessness to be able to raise the inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups working in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"on YouTube, the video kept the moments when he had lit himself."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors couldn't do anything anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists in the place warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have a thing together: they were all family fathers who were helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and incapable of fulfilling their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which most of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to maintain its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"in front of a century, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to grow only slowly, and the local population only gets little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime is denied the Ahwazi Arabs systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government also has built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to destroying the devastation caused in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fishing and palms industry."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectionist not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement released by Ayomid Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say I'm not a feminist, many women react to women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even laid well thought-out scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to doing what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms are still making sure that women sooner or later come to a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still spreading across the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am double and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women should come together to" "lift their voices and" "to sing" "Kumbaya, my lord" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about it in addition to sexualized violence an institutionalized form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women on a two-fold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or, that black women and women of other ethnicities and hereditary sorties earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want that all women, all men and all human beings do not have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose centre is the white woman who refuses to take into account injustices in their thinking, which refer to gender as well as on the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always denied me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" am I not a woman? "and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is a demented and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, to advance their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to revive them."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women different information a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release me full and completely from feminism, which was called for my dark skin and status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life neither passed nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine devoted to international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again, Nabil Musa returned to Iraq last 7 years - mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern by the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," Musa tells. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the Waterkeepers Iraq, a subsidiary of Waterkeepers Iraq - committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we no longer have any water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia of Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of their work lies on persecuted, little respected subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with their help suppressed communities to tell their stories in their way."</seg>
<seg id="2477">Paraguayans women and their difficult fight against violence</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of Kurdistan. the article is part of the series # PorserMujer (# weightlessness) that reports on violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner, who had become violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time had passed and the police said that her statement would be laid to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena because of abuse, the acute ad of Ada Báez has nothing to do with her."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"some days later, the second woman withdrew her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"in general, if women have an ad in general, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, report to the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion, wishes and suggestions. we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey. online Survey Information for survey participants"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher on gender issues at Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 ads went to the district prosecutor 9600 ads because of domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5000 advertisements because of domestic violence in peace education. here, 86% of the ads came from women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women reported that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women were talking about psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." "to any woman who is refusing in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"at the end of 2014, there are two women who do not do this," "she said at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's suicide is not an own offence, the prosecutor's authorities can not be adequately documented how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"only until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez was the strong friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then came to her. this should always be regretted."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos. but two years, she endured the psychological violence on her part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women are going to be subservient because they are fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mistreatment had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner has mistreated them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te creo ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"after all, her wealthy partner managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads among the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives, they received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a process against her former partner, who developed into an unpredictable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguayan laws: good approach, lack of implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>

<seg id="2627">"from the USA to India:" "open Source" "seed producers change global food production"</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about potential environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant, which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was only made by his own ingenuity and the question of how many Salateries he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that it could not continue to be used for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only suitable for single varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, special red or green or canned leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more such patents have been registered for more and more plants such as cereals or cartels. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts have been concerned about food safety and the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton always breeds a salad, but it has become more and more difficult for his work because his work is more and more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if in a river there are a boulder, around which I have to paddling."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new salad, because all the characteristics are patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he also joined a movement, which is becoming increasingly bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (" Open Source "breeder)."</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have been bred and eaten red Roman salat in the greenhouse" "greenhouse" "of the station. there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds like this, as if the movement from the IT sector would come from and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for" Open Source "Seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, providing alternatives to copyright protected software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it has been called into life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and can be used permanently for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit themselves to use other seeds of bred seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others to breed their seeds, breeding it to breed their own varieties, and it is not immediately ejected - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patrons."</seg>
<seg id="2648">"in 2014, dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seeds and the ability to breed new plants is important for food safety and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"Hemp exhibition, museum of natural history Fribourg, CH Book for children, 1920 Botanic representations"</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to providing other seed companies free of charge. thus, their approach is to patent seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is jeopardized because the available gene pool, due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available, constantly shrinks."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of OSSI, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are no such estimates, but experts like Luby suggest that mass produced plants such as wheat are still patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of the point of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred so that they have targeted features - from such circumstances, through which their taste or colour can be improved to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changing conditions are much worse by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-spokeswoman Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property is other breeders as" patents and protection of plant varietal innovations promote. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection therefore inhibits innovation, but encourages them to provide more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly no innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for a long time to breed to plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton, however, is that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" "we do not create the characteristics ourselves."</seg>

<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US State Oregon and OSSI Executive Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" "who breeds a variety, also raises its own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation of mass herbicides, breeders breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is opposite.</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such, which are moving on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are patents), they create most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either lean them or hold it for too expensive and therefore not worth it or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the opinion that breeders would be innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "it looks like I'm with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than company that patenting."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I always need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors are selling my grades in a couple of years," he says. "with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition, which makes it easy for my opinion." worldwide resonance "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seem to be a leader in the" open source "breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is a" open source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol works on an open source license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(provisions for the breeding are different from country to country, hence the OSSI obligation cannot simply be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, states that conventional bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is still not a law; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016 the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed breeding systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over Eastern Africa to learn about the" Open Source "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for" Open Source "seed systems, explains that the organization is currently developing a global alliance for open source" seed systems for the planned next year of the official start-up. "</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups (among them Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity in order to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - a network of aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - has published a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a link between the Luby of OSSI, hoping to see more people soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care of where and how it is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make the people clearer that there is more behind their food."</seg>
