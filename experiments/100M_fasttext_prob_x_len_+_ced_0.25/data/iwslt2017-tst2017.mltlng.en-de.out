this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as New York Times reporter .
&quot; for a long time before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the NSA illeg@@ ally interc@@ epted phones from Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this context , he describes a catastro@@ phic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA released literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against the Ris@@ en and asked him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train he became a symbol of the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , and p@@ onder@@ ing journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the people they give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave rep@@ orters already did before him : he refused and said he would rather go into jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they have been indications that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were om@@ itted . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the rep@@ orters and sources can always hide themselves less . &quot;
&quot; instead of failing and ris@@ king the statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , were secre@@ tly worried about his telephone conversation , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit report , and even travel wise with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack @-@ pres@@ umed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much concerned about their work . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result that a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology is allowed by the government to circum@@ vent the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can take this from the moment in which they receive contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that has not yet been written as a crack , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source monitoring system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as in any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encryp@@ ted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot secre@@ tly obtain information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outs@@ et . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments all over the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that thre@@ aten us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us that not only technology den@@ omin@@ ators like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to kill mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental officer , who strikes the alarm for contaminated water from Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street Insider , who warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest dat@@ l@@ eck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; revealed that rich and mighty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see emails , exchange of messages , such as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has re@@ signed .
&quot; in addition , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s mail@@ box firms has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous c@@ elli@@ st . &quot;
&quot; now , there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others who wait pati@@ ently for the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
&quot; now it sounds like the plot of an agency , or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel . &quot;
&quot; it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we go ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all of their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and wear their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine how a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe is in front of me .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters . &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
&quot; probably because there were no prominent Americans who were in these revel@@ ations , this scandal . &quot;
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; however , by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to give less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ visibility in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to zo@@ cken school children .

it is this kind of behaviour that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself an African Minister who wanted to bring the susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that all up to a lawyer told our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was given money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our hidden investig@@ ator .
&quot; it is not about a single top politicians , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we have to change the rules . &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult .
&quot; this may sound all very comfor@@ ting , as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing has ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;

&quot; in the past few years , we have seen pre@@ views towards more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU inv@@ ests in central regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States is behind .

&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes . &quot;
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms .
we need managers in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this type of in@@ consistency .
&quot; together , we can finally end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; a day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red car was standing and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that , he would go to the peace scor@@ ps . &quot;
he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I listened to myself : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed to the ceiling , and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what have I added to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild@@ card sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , at ten tips at the door , and shut my bedroom door shut . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t mad at all .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the work of art , which he had bought from me , hang@@ s today in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
that was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as stran@@ gers were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ready , my ro@@ omm@@ ate draws from and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our flat becomes a designer bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
Ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot;
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ettes decor@@ ate completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and fell the door to the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
the things came into the rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can invite other people to stay overnight . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missile would ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they are not . &quot;
&quot; no one , who is still at Tro@@ st , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned all that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can concentrate on things you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
&quot; at the Academy of Art , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who never met before . &quot;
can Design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your coma .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I &apos;d like to lock your mobile phone .
enter your left seat next to your left seat .
this quiet touch of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time .
the only thing that is even more personal than your mobile is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most of the guests feel comfortable if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; by Andrzej On September 2 , 2012 &quot;
could you please announce that he was can@@ di@@ aled for the President &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor could only be imagined with his name , when he tells him where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine , you would have 150 assessments that all say , &quot; &quot; he really can hold very well @-@ locked cell phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to hand your mobile phone ?
&quot; for a well thought @-@ out feedback system , trust is crucial . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , we have done some things wrong . &quot;
it was hard for the people to give negative jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest stayed on their assessments before we presented them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how they relate to age and residence . &quot;
we trust the people most of the time that are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
&quot; it is exciting , if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments . &quot;
&quot; if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation makes common@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much money is available . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you say too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; as for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- if the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle Art@@ works in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first : unbelievable , good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need not been covered before .
&quot; for us , the business is just very good . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who were un@@ allowed party parties or d@@ well@@ ings .
hosts have allowed guests in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked with customer service . &quot;
&quot; I stood at the front front , when trust was broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .

because people are familiar with each other .
&quot; if confidence is working , there can be mira@@ cles . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to be prone to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know them properly .
&quot; you drive one in your car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they bring books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it !
&quot; so , of course , not every stay . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of partial participation fit together with money transactions ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; but it &apos;s just a &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the matter is not just the case . &quot;
&quot; share Economy describes a trade , which promises human relations . &quot;
&quot; people put a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what would be if jour@@ neys would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you visited , a group of Ans@@ wer would be waiting for a thorough filling and to show one in a Knei@@ pent@@ ine neighborhood , of which one has never heard of . &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to shape apartments from the bottom to a shared share ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of joint participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships , rather than soli@@ tude and sec@@ lusion . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that the government belonged . &quot;
&quot; now residents are offered . students who were looking for a lead , were now offered . &quot;
&quot; they were medi@@ ated to people whose children were moved out . inc@@ ub@@ ators were launched , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . today , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
the idea seems not to be so crazy about how it was taught .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there were also a lot of hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why does our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realized that we can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find that amaz@@ ingly , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
&quot; I have to think about it , if a red Mazda passes over me . &quot;
&quot; we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if we could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon . &quot;
thank you .

I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of coverage on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;

and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , for , baby , I wasn &apos;t born so . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends but as Muslim . I decided to wear hi@@ j@@ ab , my head covering . &quot;
femin@@ ism and gender demo@@ c@@ rac@@ y@@ are an all @-@ encomp@@ assing shared task of the Heinrich Bö@@ ll Foundation .
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence , and compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old , I was able to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only adopted the faith of my parents .
I have increased with the Koran .
&quot; I read him , thought , asked , dou@@ b@@ ted and believed in the end . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow devotion that deep@@ ened each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to we@@ eping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , fully understands , and yet loves somehow ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyp@@ tians , my career as a engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking message . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ litt@@ ing out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock turned quickly into indig@@ nation .
why should I do so ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others transformed me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we drove in silence -- so deeply moved into my seat , and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as Mus@@ lim@@ in . &quot;
&quot; we moved in this night into our apartment , in a new town where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d cau@@ ti@@ ously , &quot; &quot; Be careful in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Vers@@ am@@ mm@@ elt not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day , where Muslims gather to pray . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a target . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of the people that were held for Muslims in the Free Trade . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have got the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
&quot; I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ?
some people want Muslims to ban@@ ish and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tum@@ our in the body of the United States .
it only poses the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
&quot; they know that a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our is removed as a whole , and a ben@@ ign tumor can only be observed under observation . &quot;
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , cre@@ ators and Olymp@@ ism . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; it might be a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop the terror . &quot;
the regular visiting of a mos@@ que leads to seeing people of other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant and to show greater public participation .
&quot; and like me , a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the process of the radic@@ alisation process , one has found that he is starting online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts hate the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establish@@ es its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you have a look at them , they don &apos;t drive what they are in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality they can read in the scrip@@ ture .
a prominent Imam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ fers to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; nothing inspi@@ res and something that would have made sense of their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alisation of extre@@ mi@@ sts , who promised a solution . &quot;
the Imam established the connection with God and their congregation .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mos@@ que , guar@@ ded them to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day be on our democracy , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we are afraid , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you submit messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they are more likely to agree military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood against Muslims down@@ stairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraqi war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected .
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to extend the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we feel it perhaps first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; at the assignment of collective guilt , it is not just about to explain yourself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young couple who lived in Ch@@ apel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his ré@@ sum@@ é . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a sealed young man from my fr@@ at@@ ernity ? &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;

&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot only be im@@ moral , but also deadly . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mos@@ que or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; we bes@@ ought it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would be controlled by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Imam made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests because half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to help us . &quot;
&quot; in this moment , I have broken together . &quot;
these people were there because they had courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to go safe ?
or will you join to those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might say that you hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a monument with drau@@ ght , working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I &apos;m in no way any exception .
&quot; if people like an exception usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , it is short to become a billion business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . &quot;
&quot; before the air @-@ p@@ act is entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . several years ago , they began to fly with ro@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting them , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ loaded structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and react generally to nature laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible possible flight .
&quot; in order to operate a system autonom@@ ously , it must know collective knowledge where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an editor of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; External commands are available on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called tail starter , &quot;
a flight device that tries to strike two flies with a fla@@ p .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping page . &quot;
a restri@@ ction of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter what position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; such a question would be for example , what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known for example as machines with a thousand mobile parts that get together to hurt you .
&quot; for decades , trained pilots could fly remote controlled aircraft , which had only two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
we discovered that flying with only one works .
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ controlled flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and lateral ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in space . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to bring it to the flying , I have to throw it correctly . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right , if all of you see is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ri@@ cally .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; as a result , it receives the external capability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction he is shot or even as he rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; a lot is available in models , the rest will be learned directly at flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see this .
&quot; when flying machines are part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this revol@@ ves around clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the others against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; if you build it together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a engine or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if it is limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making half an air@@ plane .
the last demonstration analyses synthe@@ tical s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commer@@ cially available micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weigh@@ s less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; on Broadway , the particularly secure machine would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , the reward is in the development and creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the i .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes surround each other in a very far distant gal@@ ax@@ y . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , it lit bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe . &quot;
it was a very big boy .
but they didn &apos;t put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
&quot; the whole energy was handed over into space @-@ time , and the universe exploded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves . &quot;
&quot; at first , we arrange the events in a timely manner . &quot;
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , there was just a multi @-@ camp life on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has brought some things out : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans , and -- God help us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly Mu@@ tiger -- Ra@@ i Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves that are caused by colli@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most kept them crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognize them as crazy genius , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ ers gra@@ vit@@ ational waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , LI@@ GO &apos;s precision was significantly improved , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is called Advanced Light . &quot;
&quot; in early September 2015 , LI@@ GO has launched a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commission@@ ing of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ded black holes were scre@@ ened through the earth . &quot;
&quot; they went through you and me , &quot;
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Birth of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my to@@ d@@ sick father .
&quot; basically , it was the fruit of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : that &apos;s my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories like LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a strengthening of space and time .
&quot; when over@@ hau@@ ling the shaft , the room and its entire content are stretched into one direction and put into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illu@@ stra@@ tive , lect@@ urers in courses of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and du@@ sting , stretch and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched out and stretched out of us . stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . Dar@@ um , one explained the LI@@ GO staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and that &apos;s absurd , this length would have to be precisely measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about Gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you around you . &quot;
&quot; in killing , it is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child is about .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain features like pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ mer Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by watching changes in ampli@@ tude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we transform the wave pattern into sound , we can literally hear the universe literally . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gra@@ vit@@ ation , we can tell us a lot about the collision between two black holes , which my colleague Scott has worked very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
&quot; it is a kind of motion detector , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date , which at least I never forget -- I heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of noise &#93; Any person who knows what to hear , see this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the di@@ gest body in all , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , revol@@ ves around a hundred times a second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
there is the permanent meaning of LI@@ GO .
&quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new path to the exploration of the al@@ ls , as never before . &quot;
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible . &quot;
so much in the space we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
&quot; a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through because these are opaque .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I &apos;m optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found the first outlet things we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes like LI@@ GO them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . so to speak , the black holes are so to speak for our arch@@ e@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the universe .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in all .
what could be more beautiful than to listen to the sound of the original ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream come with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot;
&quot; a year long , I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter whether it made me nervous , brought me in unpleasant situations , I forced myself &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
do I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on television ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
do I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared was my fear .
&quot; my fear of keeping words , my social anxiety -- exhaust , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes that changed my life , to an unexpected clause . it began with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once , if I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I swear to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I understood that &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; I saved my career with my children . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think of things , aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
&quot; I have TV , great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for contributing 70 hours of program to the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time in production . &quot;
&quot; each shipment offers hundreds of jobs , which did not exist before . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a television producer can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
350 million dollars for one season .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are ship@@ ments I created myself and not only produced , so yet on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who &apos;s doing this ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
&quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work as hard if you now have a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a budget to take me seriously when I speak of work so that you understand that I &apos;m not just around the computer and imagin@@ able , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not going to dream with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; if I am deep@@ ened to work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country from nowhere .
&quot; it is , when I set up troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a gir@@ dle , you have a high tone , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working fine .
&quot; a sw@@ amp begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sw@@ amp sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on her . &quot;
&quot; many people take part , if I tell them the sums that I talk about writing that writing to me is joy@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I started working and working and working and working , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the sums ! &quot;
Sum@@ men is more than writing .
Sum@@ men is action and activity . Sum@@ men is a drug .
Sum@@ men is music . hum@@ ming is light and air .
the sw@@ amp is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ ma , then you can not strive for great@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; the feeling cannot be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the Sum@@ men .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is genius .
maybe it is ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more things I write , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more I write history . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land which I fri@@ ghten , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sw@@ amp , the sw@@ amp , the sw@@ amp . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this sw@@ amp ?
and then the Sum@@ men stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ hau@@ led , burned out . &quot;
the Sum@@ men stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working title .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; estimate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the Sum@@ men stopped . &quot;
the sums of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t really love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the Sum@@ men did not come back .
my sum@@ m@@ ons was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , well @-@ worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleep@@ y doesn &apos;t give up , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me silence .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect titanium .
&quot; I was a show @-@ titanium , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the Sum@@ men and the Sum@@ men I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l you , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you do it , you are working , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one of the sums it feels when the sums stop , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I want to say No , when two things are aware of : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say Yes to all and secondly , she called me not &quot; estimate . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; estimate &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I am titanium and my Sum@@ men wor@@ ries , and here everything is changing from my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; we play and their sisters come together , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to fit . &quot;
I &apos;m focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I create , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax candles and the song in which it is letting go , or whatever the girls in &quot; The ice queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ tain .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy shift comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are coming back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sw@@ amp . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magic secret .
but let us stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it &apos;s something we forgot .
&quot; the sums , the work sum , the Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ um , that is only the substitute . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I &apos;m telling you who I am , when I describe myself using programs and TV @-@ hours and how well my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums are . &quot;
Sum@@ men is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on joy .
the real sw@@ amp is dependent on love .
sum@@ ming is the current that comes from the lust of lust .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sw@@ amp ignor@@ es the pressure of history , which leads to enlighten@@ ing tasks , expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real sw@@ amp is simple and original .
&quot; true sums are God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this for a firm rule , so that I can free myself as a Work@@ ah@@ olic from any fault . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I &apos;d rather be at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this con@@ fession is painful , for what kind of person would rather be better than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we swi@@ ft@@ ly around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always pick up my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe fulfilled me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask : why did we ever get up with the games ?
&quot; you can also say , &quot; Yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot;
maybe you keep me nai@@ ve for a day dream .
&quot; you probably right , but you can also do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they don &apos;t want to do something else .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ eks replaces me . &quot;
&quot; and talk my teen@@ ie daughter full 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more requires it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring 15 minutes to play , even in a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes per piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my feel@@ ers , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ m@@ ons to have a place for peace . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about pleasure .
&quot; in order to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself in 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes per piece - why not indul@@ ge in full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
sum@@ ming came back in my free time . the sums seem to return if I do not work .
work does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months open a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sums are not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sw@@ amp .
the Sum@@ men of Life .
the Sum@@ men of Love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but only one part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve never seen a titanium , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
&quot; I said yes to less work , and to play more . &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires burn still .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear@@ er my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sw@@ amp , the more this unusual , be@@ aming , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think of things , I raise you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means to live its dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more play . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from a second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical interventions .
&quot; for sure , they have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; in this way , one impl@@ anted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
&quot; it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered under severe trem@@ ors and severe pain . &quot;
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
the story started 15 years ago .
&quot; at the time , I was senior nurse and worked day and night in the emergency room . &quot;
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas increases the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
&quot; in order to save life , you have to reduce the skull pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to be able to grow cells from a tissue piece , it is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your family . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to flour@@ ish . &quot;
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed . &quot;
he saw him under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
&quot; they never die , they are imm@@ ortal . &quot;
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
&quot; they shared slowly , and after a few weeks they even died . &quot;
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the stage of the fet@@ us , they care for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they stay ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so safe . &quot;
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ language area , and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and they subsequently mark color in order to be able to trace them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we pl@@ agu@@ ed them at the entrance of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we irrit@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we irrit@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we pl@@ anting the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they had been removed , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added a violation to and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells survived -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were irrit@@ ated .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we couldn &apos;t stop here . &quot;
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food p@@ ellets from a tablet .
that made them very good .
&quot; when they had reached a stable level of skill , we spent the mot@@ oric c@@ ort@@ ex in the mot@@ oric Cort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; then , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spont@@ ane@@ ously recre@@ ate up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at a certain degree , just as with the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , they see the monkeys that took spont@@ ane@@ ously . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we pl@@ anting the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rei@@ m@@ plant@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; I can tell you , that was also very exciting for us . &quot;
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant them in humans .
I really hope I can see you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely do .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look further into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to carry out the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
you have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as an un@@ changeable geography .
we believe that capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have demonstrated no doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ mistak@@ ably clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that were realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who said to me that democracy would aboli@@ sh it if they would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , could save us , but that we need a tru@@ thful and defensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are painted , our future is glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; twin Pe@@ aks &quot; &quot; -@@ Revival cast@@ et Robert Kne@@ pper &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which casts its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all know the debt mountain , &quot;
but only a few know his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy Spar@@ ks and corporations who , however , are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and income that is urg@@ ently needed , which is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 billion tri@@ llion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 Billi@@ ons of US dollars sounds after much money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ llion US dollar , which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low demand that fears the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of the investors who are afraid of the proph@@ ecy of the ov@@ el could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown . &quot;
&quot; if the circumstances are un@@ inten@@ tional , the body will kill him . &quot;
that is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand among democracy ?
&quot; Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society , in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy closed down too many -- -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to alle@@ vi@@ ate the importance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that they entered the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same m@@ oods in matters of state matters . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ish democracy has not kept a long time .
&quot; like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is also quickly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democra@@ cies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens . &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ish democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economics was possible and the democratic process was bor@@ rowed into politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- was a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s democra@@ cies , there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , and the economy gradually escal@@ ates politics . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer just like before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because you can be in the government nowadays , and yet not in power , because the power of politics is w@@ aged in the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that nour@@ ishes the animals from which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; the power of corporations is growing , political goods are being exploited , political goods are being exploited , inequality increases , and the managers of the corporations are fri@@ ghtened to invest in the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; reserves the control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
&quot; the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago , and it wasn &apos;t very good . &quot;
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ acon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position like in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : creating the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage labour by autom@@ ating and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separated , the automation of the twin peaks is higher , the waste gained , and social conflicts deeper , as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we need to transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and ensure that we democra@@ ti@@ ze the re@@ unified section , otherwise we are in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has brought forth . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; or by something that is similar to the &quot; Star Trek , &quot; in the machines to serve people , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long conversations with the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; so , what could it look like to have these &quot; Star Trek &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company , please make a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital is working with you from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; there is no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not work therein , and employees who work there which the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately not a temporary twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the whole world trade in this currency is tra@@ ded -- we call them &quot; the universe , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or trading income of the country , into a mutual fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment instruments are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Brett@@ on W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
&quot; the problem was that , at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it . &quot;
&quot; today , we have it , especially in front of the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe you is at the same time liberal in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world ?
or will we sink into a matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liberal Marxists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do not we do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in total economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from part of the Earth to the next , as we are experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , that is why I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely wir@@ y . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner at the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal democra@@ cies , we have the impression of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays -- the sphere of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say that this is so provoc@@ ative , China is similar to England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what we can now observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now prefer@@ ring to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ elling with hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I felt that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; to say goodbye to us from the self @-@ lev@@ y , and the permanent denial that a massive distribution line was passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be mas@@ sively threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this denial -- -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , will continue to den@@ ounce the denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it will perhaps be delayed for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that wasn &apos;t .
&quot; they only wanted to take our government , just because they did not want to deal with the gra@@ dations that were running through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to conf@@ ess that they had been a catastro@@ phic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one @-@ third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one out of the tro@@ ika of the len@@ ders , who imposed this policy , arose : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if they don &apos;t survive , they will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have catastro@@ phic consequences alone for Europe , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be equally bear@@ able to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price have never heard most of them , although he probably is responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is Managing Director at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has a hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing the shows and content that is produced by Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fought industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy does not have any choice .
&quot; he needs to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he needs to find shows that are quite right on this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the website , the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this review . &quot;
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price is not about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you already have special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the medium spread , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price wants nothing to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online , where everyone can watch for free . &quot;

they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or look again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and the answer is : &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that there are not many to remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; instead of organising a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewers : what shows they like , which shows they like , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had together all the parts together , they went a car and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
&quot; by Andrzej On September 2 , 2012 &quot;
&quot; if one coll@@ ects millions of data , for a decision that one meets , you should make a good decision . &quot;
one has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimized it through very powerful computers .
&quot; the Min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit fri@@ ghtening because we are living in a time in which we have more and more on statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you &apos;re in jail . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the US and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether an accident occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems doesn &apos;t know how to use data .
&quot; the data sealed , too , is incorrect . &quot;
&quot; yes , even Google does sometimes make mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could be predicted by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worse way -- by data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
&quot; it worked wonderful and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year around year by year until it didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could tell why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ voc@@ ation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data flows quickly into decisions of life -- in the workplace , in case of legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people can use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you are mainly doing two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the components ; as a branch , set the items together to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we possess it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , pieces and pieces will be set up again , even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially when it &apos;s the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been able to do , but the decision how to put all these pieces back together and making a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions first when they scored TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; that &apos;s what the data tells us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called Magic 8 Ball . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ Question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have made some decisions in my life so far . I had to listen to the ball in hind@@ sight .
&quot; however , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it by something much more frac@@ tured , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
