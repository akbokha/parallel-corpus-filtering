<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for a long time before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally intercepted phones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this context, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA released literally drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against the Risen and asked him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train he became a symbol of the pattern of the government, whistleblower, and pondering journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the people they give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters already did before him: he refused and said he would rather go into jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they have been indications that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were omitted."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can always hide themselves less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and risking the statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, were secretly worried about his telephone conversation,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit report, and even travel wise with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack-presumed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much concerned about their work."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result that a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology is allowed by the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can take this from the moment in which they receive contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that has not yet been written as a crack, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source monitoring system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by Aaron Swartz, which has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just as in any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot secretly obtain information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments all over the world are developing new espionage technologies that threaten us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us that not only technology denominators like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to kill misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next environmental officer, who strikes the alarm for contaminated water from Flint. or a Wall Street Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on April 3, 2016 the biggest datleck of history was published.] [the" Panama Papers "revealed that rich and mighty] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]"</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see emails, exchange of messages, such as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"in addition, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's mailbox firms has in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now, there will be a lot of richer people and others who wait patiently for the next release, and on the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">"now it sounds like the plot of an agency, or a John-Grisham-novel."</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we go?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all of their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and wear their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine how a Matryoschkapuppe is in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because there were no prominent Americans who were in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to give less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of invisibility in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to zocken school children.</seg>

<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself an African Minister who wanted to bring the suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all up to a lawyer told our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was given money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our hidden investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top politicians, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we have to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult.</seg>

<seg id="91">"for us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy that stand up and say: "Intransparent is not good for the business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this type of inconsistency.</seg>

<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was almost abducted and in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red car was standing and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that, he would go to the peace scorps."</seg>
<seg id="101">He told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," "I don't know." ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I listened to myself: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Ah, how please?" ""</seg>

<seg id="114">A wildcard sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, at ten tips at the door, and shut my bedroom door shut."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't mad at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the work of art, which he had bought from me, hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as strangers were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>

<seg id="123">"we make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost ready, my roommate draws from and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think about how we could earn something. our flat becomes a designer bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [Airbed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>

<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham omelettes decorate completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and fell the door to the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into the rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented the investors:" we would like to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>

<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they are not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still at Trost, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can concentrate on things you can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Academy of Art, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can Design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we aspire.</seg>

<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor could only be imagined with his name, when he tells him where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine, you would have 150 assessments that all say," "he really can hold very well-locked cell phones!" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would have to hand your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">"for a well thought-out feedback system, trust is crucial."</seg>
<seg id="173">"at the beginning, we have done some things wrong."</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to give negative judgments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest stayed on their assessments before we presented them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how they relate to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most of the time that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">"it is exciting, if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation makes commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much money is available."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you say too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"as for example," I have problems with my mother "-- -- if the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle Artworks in your apartment! I do with my family holiday." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first: unbelievable, good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is just very good."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were unallowed party parties or dwellings.</seg>

<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word" breaking message. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people splitting out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do so?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam...,..."... ""</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu, the deeds of others transformed me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new city and begin with the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we drove in silence -- so deeply moved into my seat, and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as Muslimin."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved in this night into our apartment, in a new town where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "Be alert," "Seid cautiously," "Be careful in well lit areas," "Versammmelt not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday in that week -- the day, where Muslims gather to pray."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of the people that were held for Muslims in the Free Trade."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I don't have any questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them?</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims to banish and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumour in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only poses the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">"they know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole, and a benign tumor can only be observed under observation."</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, creators and Olympism."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it might be a few parking spaces, but don't stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visiting of a mosque leads to seeing people of other faiths more tolerant and to show greater public participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and like me, a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalized in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the process of the radicalisation process, one has found that he is starting online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family so that the extremists hate the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I believe that we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you have a look at them, they don't drive what they are in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality they can read in the scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">A prominent Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she prefers to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"nothing inspires and something that would have made sense of their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalisation of extremists, who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">The Imam established the connection with God and their congregation.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, guarded them to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia and my family are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day be on our democracy, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we are afraid, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you submit messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they are more likely to agree military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood against Muslims downstairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraqi war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to extend the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we feel it perhaps first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>

<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we besought it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would be controlled by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests because half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to help us."</seg>

<seg id="409">"before the air-pact is entered into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. several years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting them, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-loaded structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and react generally to nature laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible possible flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order to operate a system autonomously, it must know collective knowledge where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an editor of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"External commands are available on the highest level, e.g." "Start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called tail starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to strike two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most starters, it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping page."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of stern starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the flight device doesn't matter what position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often provide basic abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"such a question would be for example, what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known for example as machines with a thousand mobile parts that get together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"for decades, trained pilots could fly remote controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and lateral rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to bring it to the flying, I have to throw it correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right, if all of you see is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the omnibus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrically.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, it receives the external capability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction he is shot or even as he rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"a lot is available in models, the rest will be learned directly at flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves around clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if you build it together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a engine or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if it is limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making half an airplane.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration analyses synthetical swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Broadway, the particularly secure machine would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types like us, the reward is in the development and creative act."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in a spectacular way."</seg>

<seg id="495">"for illustrative, lecturers in courses of relativity often lead to a really albering dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dusting, stretch and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>

<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by watching changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we transform the wave pattern into sound, we can literally hear the universe literally."</seg>

<seg id="564">"my fear of keeping words, my social anxiety -- exhaust, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "yes" "has changed my life."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes that changed my life, to an unexpected clause. it began with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">"Marcia Cross in" "Quantico" "(Spoiler)"</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimate, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once, if I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said," "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on, I swear to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I understood that" "yes" "I saved my career with my children."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think of things, awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I have TV, great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for contributing 70 hours of program to the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are at the same time in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each shipment offers hundreds of jobs, which did not exist before."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television producer can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">Episode: # 5.04 Devil's Night (American Horror Story)</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">America's strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans-Atlantic security partnership</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are shipments I created myself and not only produced, so yet on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who's doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it because I know what you think, when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who work as hard if you now have a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a budget to take me seriously when I speak of work so that you understand that I'm not just around the computer and imaginable, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not going to dream with a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"if I am deepened to work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set up troops, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a girdle, you have a high tone, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working fine.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a swamp begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the swamp sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take part, if I tell them the sums that I talk about writing that writing to me is joyful."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started working and working and working and working, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">Summen is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Summen is action and activity. Summen is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">Summen is music. humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The swamp is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a summa, then you can not strive for greatness."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling cannot be different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more things I write, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more I write history."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land which I frighten, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the swamp, the swamp, the swamp."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this swamp?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the Summen stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overloaded, overhauled, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The Summen stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "estimate, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the Summen stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't really love my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Summen did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My summons was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, well-worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan sleepy doesn't give up, with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-titanium,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the Summen and the Summen I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "howl you, stupid author-titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, you do it, you are working, you're doing what you're doing to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one of the sums it feels when the sums stop, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late and she says," "Mama, do you like to play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say No, when two things are aware of:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say Yes to all and secondly, she called me not" estimate. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"she calls no more" "estimate". ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am titanium and my Summen worries, and here everything is changing from my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, do you like to play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come together, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and in the absence of summing, I can't do anything except to fit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I'm focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax candles and the song in which it is letting go, or whatever the girls in" The ice queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I attain.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy shift comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that's not right away, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a swamp."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the work sum, the Titanensum, that is only the substitute."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I'm telling you who I am, when I describe myself using programs and TV-hours and how well my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums are."</seg>
<seg id="707">Summen is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real swamp is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">Summing is the current that comes from the lust of lust.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real swamp ignores the pressure of history, which leads to enlightening tasks, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real swamp is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true sums are God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this for a firm rule, so that I can free myself as a Workaholic from any fault."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I'd rather be at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, for what kind of person would rather be better than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we swiftly around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always pick up my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfilled me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why did we ever get up with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">"you can also say," Yes, if your child wants to play with you. "</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me naive for a day dream.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably right, but you can also do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they don't want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">"after 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or Keks replaces me."</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talk my teenie daughter full 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more requires it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can bring 15 minutes to play, even in a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my feelers, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is true to feel the summons to have a place for peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it's about pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself in 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" "stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to meet myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes per piece - why not indulge in full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">Summing came back in my free time. the sums seem to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months open a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sums are not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>

<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but only one part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"I've never seen a titanium, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">"I said yes to less work, and to play more."</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my bonfires burn still.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this swamp, the more this unusual, beaming, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less titanium -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am a writer. I think of things, I raise you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means to live its dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more play."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from a second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"for sure, they have one of the most well-known, the" "deep brain stimulation". "in this way, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">"it is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered under severe tremors and severe pain."</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at the time, I was senior nurse and worked day and night in the emergency room."</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that skull-brain traumas increases the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, you have to reduce the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to be able to grow cells from a tissue piece, it is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your family."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity, and environments to flourish."</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François managed."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw him under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">"they shared slowly, and after a few weeks they even died."</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the stage of the fetus, they care for the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so safe."</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-language area, and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently mark color in order to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we plagued them at the entrance of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we irritate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we irritate the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we planting the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they had been removed, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added a violation to and reimplantiated exactly the same cells and now the cells survived -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were irritated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we couldn't stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">That made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable level of skill, we spent the motoric cortex in the motoric Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an unchangeable geography.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated no doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy disappears with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that were realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who said to me that democracy would abolish it if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, could save us, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are painted, our future is gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "twin Peaks" "-Revival castet Robert Knepper"</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all know the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few know his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy Sparks and corporations who, however, are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and income that is urgently needed, which is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 billion trillion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billions of US dollars sounds after much money, until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollar, which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low demand that fears the pessimism of the investors who are afraid of the prophecy of the ovel could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown."</seg>
<seg id="925">"if the circumstances are unintentional, the body will kill him."</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and to finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand among democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society, in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government."</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the athenic democracy closed down too many -- --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to alleviate the importance of the athic democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the athic democracy was and is that they entered the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same moods in matters of state matters."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenish democracy has not kept a long time.</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines very bright, it is also quickly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens."</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athenish democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta which was ultimately a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economics was possible and the democratic process was borrowed into politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- was a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, there has been a relentless struggle between the two, and the economy gradually escalates politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer just like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because you can be in the government nowadays, and yet not in power, because the power of politics is waged in the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about like a herd of predators that nourishes the animals from which they nourished, decimated, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"the power of corporations is growing, political goods are being exploited, political goods are being exploited, inequality increases, and the managers of the corporations are frightened to invest in the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" "demos" "of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" Demos "reserves the control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">"the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago, and it wasn't very good."</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the deacon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage labour by automating and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separated, the automation of the twin peaks is higher, the waste gained, and social conflicts deeper, as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to transform the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and ensure that we democratize the reunified section, otherwise we are in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film" Matrix "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has brought forth."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" "matrix", "or by something that is similar to the" Star Trek, "in the machines to serve people, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian" Agora, "in long conversations with the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so, what could it look like to have these" Star Trek "like utopia instead of" matrix "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company, please make a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital is working with you from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"there is no distinction between those who belong to the company, but who do not work therein, and employees who work there which the company does not belong to. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately not a temporary twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the whole world trade in this currency is traded -- we call them" the universe, "in units of" cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or trading income of the country, into a mutual fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment instruments are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">"the problem was that, at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it."</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, especially in front of the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe you is at the same time liberal in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the Mülleimer of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a matrix "- similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>

<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do not we do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in total economic demand, which Larry Summers is called" "long-term stagnation." ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from part of the Earth to the next, as we are experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>

<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner at the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view on China."</seg>

<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the impression of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays -- the sphere of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say that this is so provocative, China is similar to England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>

<seg id="1001">YV: I felt that this is coming.</seg>

<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say goodbye to us from the self-levy, and the permanent denial that a massive distribution line was passed through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal that revealed this denial -- --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, will continue to denounce the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable through political will and authoritarianism in life, it will perhaps be delayed for a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>

<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>

<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>

<seg id="1048">"in other words, he needs to find shows that are quite right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the website, the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this review."</seg>

<seg id="1055">Roy Price is not about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you already have special intelligence to sign "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the medium spread, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire."</seg>

<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that there are not many to remember this show because it wasn't so good."</seg>

<seg id="1076">"when they had together all the parts together, they went a car and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>

<seg id="1085">"if one collects millions of data, for a decision that one meets, you should make a good decision."</seg>

<seg id="1087">You optimized it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the Mindeste, what you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is a bit frightening because we are living in a time in which we have more and more on statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch, you're in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the US and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether an accident occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn't know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">"the data sealed, too, is incorrect."</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google does sometimes make mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it could be predicted by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worse way -- by data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">"it worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>

<seg id="1113">"data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?"</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, pieces and pieces will be set up again, even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially when it's the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been able to do, but the decision how to put all these pieces back together and making a show like" House of Cards "does not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions first when they scored TV ideas, then they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" that's what the data tells us. "</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called Magic 8 Ball. it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-Question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made some decisions in my life so far. I had to listen to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"however, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it by something much more fractured, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
