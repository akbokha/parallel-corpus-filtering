Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view to the city

the oldest official map of Munich inspi@@ res exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; this is what everyone who had to be exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took a green me@@ adow instead of a passing road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of the state government , are all other than up @-@ to @-@ date . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
&quot; then it becomes clear , as towns and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a flip @-@ flo@@ p that you don &apos;t know as such .
&quot; in the large picture postcard , detailed maps were incorporated into cities and con@@ greg@@ ations , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; primitive parts &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these were created according to the Bay@@ erns of Bavaria , between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic record Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , the present neighbors , who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Administ@@ rative Administration . &quot;

the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the town has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is sub @-@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the map of the map , so in 18@@ 77 , as Munich &apos;s district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling concentrate around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : in the zo@@ oming phenomenon a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered items from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ination &quot; &quot; from which the property tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; today there are no farmers , but small farmers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 of the October Revolution , was actually still a me@@ adow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the original position , in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only reads the street names &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the height &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , people once blocked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ re@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ cht conducted the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the accus@@ ation of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , it was first place , later extended to 500 seats . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 . &quot;

the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
&quot; West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V München Ost , east of residential houses from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in an architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ re@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was named &quot; Kauf@@ man G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Allied bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre . &quot;

&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;

&quot; the National Association for the promotion of colors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will take effect until 28 August 2017 , invites af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of dubi@@ ous , rapid @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and here , &quot; &quot; says the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; they have injuries of civil rights that happen to people . &quot;
&quot; they will stick to their skin colour , they will be beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Ro@@ d Ch@@ apel , the Kansas City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such frequency we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey by the state , and was taken by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in custody without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also has a recently published report of the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Ch@@ apel . &quot;
people must be willing to bring the deposit money or let the relatives know they travel through the state .
&quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report program , which entered the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
travel warnings is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the U.S. . &quot;

I can &apos;t profit on such steep areas .
&quot; the grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , much needed to be dealt with with the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the parent company and crops it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if it does not lead to bio@@ business . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the woman &apos;s sound project and is happy about leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to support farmers . &quot;
I hope that the demands of the areas could be moved for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they will continue their operation , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested by at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half over leader was promoted , a quarter bore the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;

now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ dos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he was a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated controversy with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN on the proposals of the President to dras@@ tically restri@@ ct legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have told him if he had done it .
&quot; but he handle their importance , and in particular the importance you wrote when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his basis was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , referring to which it was added later , is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tual right , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the touching words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; your id@@ ols , your poor , and your oppressed masses who seek to breathe freely , and the poor waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; burning waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who set themselves to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by showing the female embo@@ di@@ ment of freedom in an un@@ used classic portra@@ yal .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ ile .
the link of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly like Laz@@ arus had changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big cry as R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bap@@ tist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atives that the American flame would bring into the surrounding world : &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to be imposed on the way to the United States .
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen from the exhausted , el@@ dest , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible jour@@ neys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the true sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever want to recognize . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch shall not ligh@@ ten the way , but hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminds of a time when only two Schot@@ ten belonged to the Great Britain team
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ headed Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championships will contribute to a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; something special is developed in Scotland , &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue to find it , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m stretch while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot;
&quot; your Captain &apos;s Speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Common@@ wealth silver medal , which will compete for the fifth world champ@@ ionships in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven to have been reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir runs on this track and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs on 1,500 m , is another pit , which one should watch after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cent of her first world champ@@ ionships as the only other car@@ rot in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also in the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about it is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team mates have voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as well established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on pole positions . &quot;
what my speech concerns as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete , and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . &quot;

the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from internal politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sh@@ ook at the cri@@ tique , sure . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t put his critics to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and dum@@ b , we are guided like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Larry Hogan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ an employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people , who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compla@@ ined that this week was the beginning of this week .
&quot; the staff of the governor dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a response to &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type such as Hogan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
firm of the Year for Company Succ@@ ession and Tru@@ sts F@@ lick Go@@ cke Schaum@@ burg
he has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and de@@ fi@@ end his ha@@ iry head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons arriving on the side of the Gover@@ nor - that is a public forum that is referred to as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokes@@ woman Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the acts of Gover@@ nor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or sp@@ lash@@ ed people , which vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;

&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a past@@ or , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ prof@@ ane . &quot;
the past@@ or ordered the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not crowded , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented , that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the comments section of the news programme &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take place on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some more than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor called &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;

that shouldn &apos;t be so hard .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , his office , according to the historical documents , collected by the George Washington Project &apos;s online papers . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t put her into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .

domestic connections turn out to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; are reasonably priced at the time , &quot; &quot; says the director of the Bau@@ ho@@ fs Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ici@@ ons , as in the underground much berge , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which has always been hin@@ dered by the construction work , is a big problem for the St@@ ump@@ p construction company . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off gates is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; the road is closed , and only the buses are allowed to drive through . &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
they even rarely use a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ im@@ ents in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually design@@ ates a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the disgu@@ ised tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the floor floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare glimpse into the daily life in the Hoch@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , imposed for independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part Pap@@ ua New Guinea became the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated roof@@ s that were transformed into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ ua honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says and points to their lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and bright rock . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is the poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ancy and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an from Phoenix , lies just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was built in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has a value of $ 78 billion worth of wood resources . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a sti@@ cking presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort was paying nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 . &quot;
&quot; according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal region in the 1970 @-@ s were to commit genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from 2016 in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
bol@@ ts have strengthened since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ a@@ wes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ Cant@@ ins sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting for here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who went to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the local Pap@@ ua , the M@@ om M@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
the former Zimmermann ensured 27 of Pap@@ ua &apos;s 29 districts - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang christmas songs in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness . &quot;
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took an assault on her tone , and later returned to four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
&quot; then , one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group . &quot;
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice . &quot;
&quot; they wore cer@@ em@@ ony hun@@ t@@ ings and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle , and a bird song im@@ i@@ ding - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm . &quot;
some demonstr@@ ators began to smug@@ gle stones on police and military troops .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TIME that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TIME on the ver@@ anda of his colourful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes said , as many Indones@@ ians only carrying a name , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the Chief Inspector of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Pap@@ ua Police Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
it &apos;s about life and death .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured . &quot;
&quot; the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he submitted an extra@@ judicial mechanism to establish historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the speeches began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke in Jak@@ arta to TIME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said he did not plan to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to the UN for &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths victims in East Tim@@ or , said that 11 cases of human rights violations were already included in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were opposed to such asser@@ tions with gri@@ mm@@ ous un@@ beli@@ ever .
&quot; I was interviewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says he is still alive years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , fear to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the found@@ ries have not ceased .
&quot; on Tuesday , the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers were protest@@ ing against the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) began shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the past has been delivered quickly , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
&quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on to withdraw the officers involved , and withdraw the police from the territory . &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai always was an un@@ ru@@ h@@ eh@@ er@@ d for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in the last few years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some dive again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs that are in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe . &quot;
isolation stops the eyes of the world far away from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on media coverage remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s election campaign to raise restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who attempt to report from Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
a lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in March , six pa@@ zi@@ lian states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Pal@@ au , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onian Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the allegations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to detect the evidence for human rights violations . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take advantage of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights Ambassador to K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , the locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it is under the constant threat of a common military , is located in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ victims led a last symbolic act of the side@@ walk : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know they might never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus with a s@@ wollen head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that takes place in just two years through the high @-@ rise building , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we were standing at the fire alarm , and at the cry of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooled .
the government said she is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
&quot; the incident may have questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 resulted that the largest part of the damage caused by cl@@ adding , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died . &quot;

critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 euros ( US $ 1000 US dollars and in Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; Offer withdrawal . &quot; &quot;

&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 84@@ 0,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , it will be - all models - 500@@ .000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available . &quot;
&quot; those who ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never even in practice @-@ tested production lines with maximum capacity utili@@ sation . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to greater delays , then the non @-@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;

it is about a deadline which expi@@ red on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for soil near o@@ zone .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay compliance with a year to study his authority to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Attorney at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block or delay regul@@ ating or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the period regular roll back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administ@@ rations , the EPA often did not comply with the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to establish the appointment for the implementation , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compla@@ ined more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation by trial , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority , which gives us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a broader re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; one last month approved legislation should delay implementation of the rules of 2015 , at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet set to vote in the Senate .
&quot; the New York Attorney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States who compla@@ ins the EPA in this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our col@@ lagen - is an important gain for health and safety of this 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; new York joined in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;

tum@@ ours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. a ser@@ en@@ ade was invited . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors of the sixth charity ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of the tumor to their concerns .
&quot; Walter Martini stresses : &quot; &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ g@@ ged small od@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Wür@@ tt@@ ember@@ g@@ ische original book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the former parish church , the word according to the document arose , besides the former parish church , which belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa . &quot;
there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt office of 18@@ 58 , in addition to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which is still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement centre of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around 1600 are subject to these historical conditions .
the pat@@ ron@@ age right arose from the early medieval equity law .
&quot; a gent@@ leman who built a church , and occupied with a past@@ or , remained the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this equity . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the right to use a past@@ or or to propose a new parish priest . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was torn to Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; for the first time in 16@@ 92 , the newly purchased Glo@@ cke had to be handed over to the first time in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were inserted and the bell parts were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aky .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops enc@@ amp@@ ed in the vicinity of the church . &quot;
they broke out the pul@@ pit and chur@@ ch@@ yard and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 23 , the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
only the bell tower was left .
&quot; in 18@@ 34 a storm broke the church tower , and half fell . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
only the tower was still existing today as a witness of the 750 year old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius plant as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as a promot@@ er , the friends and promot@@ ers invite Tum@@ bl@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , at the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; it is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler grammar school in Freu@@ den@@ stadt , and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this is not the case . &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
&quot; to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view of meadows to the forest , the organisers make the fantastic view out . &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and horns . &quot;

&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim does not see any legal requirement for the construction , and therefore has turned to the Council . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim is hon@@ ouring itself &quot; , &quot; said Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to take his approval for the establishment of planned wind turbin@@ es in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbin@@ es could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the city limit to Schw@@ alm@@ tal a wind power concentration zone exists . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbin@@ es are generally possible , at the same time , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind power for the rest of the city . &quot;
these zones should prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a form defect . &quot;

the current status of things : the city council has once again decided to re @-@ establish the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit of the District Government is still pending .
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;

&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , the construction of four to 200 metres high wind turbin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; over the past year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is involved , has closed lease agreements with the owners of approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbin@@ es , electricity needs to be covered by around 11,@@ 400 households - this is equivalent to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four grown households . &quot;

Tr@@ ump continued to use telephone calls from telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump requested a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president compla@@ ined to him because he publicly denoun@@ ced the Wall . according to that , he said to him : &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t say the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ or , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was given by the government of Obama would look like a &quot; &quot; depot &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ordered the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;

&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe countryside , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the Mob@@ s - a man of middle ages in a needle @-@ strip - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .

&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams tear the silence as a young black man was crushed by the passenger seat .
&quot; luckily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only one night . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience met very real sigh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , the mayor of Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge comes back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - were forced by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that no one person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life long civil law .
&quot; for him , the post @-@ position serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must preserve justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot go to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
&quot; a court doctor puts a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to FBI records , which were obtained from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding tren@@ ches were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ making process . &quot;
but none has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the suspect has been on free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court in Georgia made it possible for the first time to give her voice to the election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI of the black Far@@ ms Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ our was in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she wore was not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they went away from the prison and approached the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and tu@@ cked the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it yet .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you sign up and if you vote , then it will happen here . &quot;
&quot; almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is clear , stri@@ pping and is based in a kind of deep racism , from which many believe that it is no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the ugly in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I have done through . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and listened to a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss @-@ clan@@ mates for years , but he said that the role will never become simpler . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a tried to play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;

he is al@@ armed and confused .

&quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ing . &quot;

&quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and precisely there is the energy in space , a feeling of compan@@ ionship replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and re@@ affir@@ ms . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed with a dress , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays sad praise &quot; Strange Fruit . &quot; &quot;
their voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators caught sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided almost equally between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just the road . &quot;
they have experienced Georgi@@ an op@@ pressive heat for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .

max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; a lot : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I can help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked in the open whole day at the school .
what are your experiences with this ?
&quot; a lot : it &apos;s a nice , wide range that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years old , so a late @-@ day volunteer . &quot;
how does that come from ?
a lot : I &apos;ve done a high school diplom@@ a .
&quot; and then a building engineer study , let &apos;s say , successfully cancelled . &quot;
&quot; I realized it &apos;s wrong for me and I want to do something else , working with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what are you doing . &quot;
&quot; a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point perhaps , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start studying in social work in the winter semester . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual study , probably at Youth welfare Her@@ ne is a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different uses during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;

&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was exactly what I had mat@@ ured . &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
what is your alternate email address ? what is your favorite thing ?
&quot; a lot : well , here it is not about to calculate St@@ ati@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people &apos;s head , each one has a completely different story behind . &quot;
&quot; if a refugee , whether a young person who has been taken out of the family , must always be individual . &quot;
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the type .
it is a range that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life . &quot;

&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces . &quot;
&quot; the job cuts , the general director John Fall@@ on , mainly committed to the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs were lost . &quot;

&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , says officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , a statement made by NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by NATO , the explosion on Thursday evening was happening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive set &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement says that all injured in a stable state are treated and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the B@@ agram air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby B@@ agram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had run this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadly militant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops killed the Taliban in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide rate in Kabul has also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policy and particularly in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;

&quot; the US Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , which states that states are committed to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to push forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said it will show the obligation of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which parts of the country must be measured in a part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions - to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that an effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges that former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of demo@@ crats and nature groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions to public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;

&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the land is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports . &quot;
&quot; although the church community has been owned by the church community until now , there is no planning of planning for the project by a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common room . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , he would provide a living space - approx . 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council are floating , such a common room not as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ iors just to see , but openly into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; Strick@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current household has already been decided in the last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is in the refur@@ bishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a community space would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal is to signal the investor , that in this respect , there is no cl@@ utter between the legs , the statement that both saddle @-@ - and roof @-@ roof - which reduces the height and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; not necessary , so not only Wilfried Soh@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
&quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he happens to the body . &quot;
not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela reputation points to the many of its own buildings , with which you don &apos;t get so right now at the common room of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I am very difficult to do so . &quot;

&quot; since 2014 , the association has been running the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 . &quot;

&quot; since 2003 in the university town , there has been a similar resem@@ blan@@ ce to the planned con@@ stellation of Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g - the planet &apos;s path . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet trail goes up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; &quot; alien site in Di@@ em@@ arden &quot; &quot; with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;

&quot; the earth shr@@ inks so on a ball of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun is at least 70 cen@@ timet@@ ers away . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to P@@ lu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with P@@ lu@@ to . &quot;

this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;

it will be a great fight . &quot;

&quot; with the first win of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , there were not the two opposite gates at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to do better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge , the three @-@ chain should also be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a crash , the far@@ es don &apos;t want to catch up anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the future , it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) will be on line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right after the experience in preparation with the tri@@ lob@@ ite , than with the four @-@ chain . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we are going to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we are just in the three @-@ chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ elmann , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; it is a prer@@ equis@@ ite , but that we are still better harmon@@ i@@ ously and we don &apos;t have so many play@@ fulness in the building . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann comes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk about a failure of a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know anything .
&quot; the start into the season is only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; Funk@@ el and Hoffmann have believed that the players from Au@@ e might even be something fresh , as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a climbing favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are as light favorite on Sunday , the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we would like them , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is non@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there are no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one must take from the start , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as chief coach . &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement , arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t would be arrogan@@ t . &quot;

&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for Foren@@ sic medicine ( Rä@@ tt@@ s@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started the tests last year .
&quot; they should make the assessment of the age more accurately during the asylum process , after the Swedish Migration Agency ( migration treaty ) has been critici@@ zed due to errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were under age . &quot;
&quot; until today , migration cl@@ auses 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to test cases and the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed the person &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det reviewed the 5@@ 81 results , she realized that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical assessment , in which X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rine scientist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological age of humans to see if they were earlier or later than normal by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we cannot tell it , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran from the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of ass@@ essing a child as an adult is minimal . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk lies in this when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;

&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads across the tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; as the two other bridges , they have now come to the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabili@@ t@@ ated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now got a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge deck on the north side .

&quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge deck will be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian road is to be run .
&quot; the special thing is that there are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ z@@ wo . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge arms .
special finger@@ tip sensation has caused the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .

&quot; for bridges between the building yard and the bus@@ stop towards Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic is controlled by a traffic light . &quot;

Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ out protest in German potato salad
&quot; it is not so often that parties move on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , F@@ WG , Left ) are part of a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell invites to the poster &quot; &quot; big election op@@ ener &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the Deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on location for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All on a table &quot; &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place at the parking below the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the Forums A World and one of the moder@@ ated organizers , is pleased : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D have come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pes is reported by the Af@@ D volcan@@ o , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement . &quot;

&quot; with a look at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chair@@ woman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence , but until now , the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the pitch have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 9 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can pull off - no special incidents .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart very openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately went off bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette performer in front of the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone who I have done . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , she spoke according to &quot; Bang Show@@ biz , &quot; but at school time when she would rather like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven I told me the children , I would like a b@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , scared and ash@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; now look back , I think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today , I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; according to For@@ bes , Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes states that he possesses coal in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father . &quot;
he is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; meanwhile , the Republican National Committee announced a declaration in which it said : &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor Justice Party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from doing so in order to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , clean message , &quot; said R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing scandal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised her on Thursday , what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be taken into the sport again . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ y@@ la@@ kh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught in competition with gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; in spite of his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) reported evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot;
the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized that they have experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted , &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been achieved but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the Athletics World Championships that will begin on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for setting up . &quot;

&quot; we bow forward to this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year old captain from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; it is not a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at noon , only the members of the Church took their leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral fes@@ tivity began in the circle of the family , the closest friends , of representatives of the Bundeswehr , as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; for example , H@@ essi@@ an Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the Chief Inspector of the Bundeswehr , Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; there were roses down , and the members of the family had arm in arm to the s@@ cour@@ ge . &quot;

&quot; Minister of Defense of the Ley@@ en described the surrounding soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; high &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no doubt at the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Ley@@ en did not show : the use is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;

Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
the Royal House was divided on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is joined by Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
&quot; the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and she continued in the message . &quot;
&quot; when Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , it is still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to set aside in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a notice that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also places the title &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted to see , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by declared the chief of the Danish royal house . &quot;

&quot; but he did not intend to join in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cracy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
&quot; on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot;
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always fled , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was floating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk @-@ sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I couldn &apos;t hope for fores@@ ight . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ash@@ amed .
&quot; that were two mistakes , too ! &quot;

Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect consumers from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ stu@@ cks@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information about the affected eggs char@@ ms . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all , what we are currently aware of , a health haz@@ ard is virtually impossible . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - , because the central role of the awareness of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ? &quot;
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been turned off immediately and has been aler@@ ted to Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
the trade has just as the manufacturer to bear care that the sold products are convenient and safe .
&quot; if you exceed 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg eggs , these are not bu@@ oy@@ ant . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time is not the business to blame .
are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current level of knowledge , production companies do not meet any direct debt . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to the pres@@ umed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the harvest . &quot;
is there only a lack of staff or an in@@ competent jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have covered the process .
&quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ over to the lawyers in the cases where crimes can be found is crucial . &quot;
&quot; I have already done several times , that I expect a complete education from the responsible authorities . &quot;
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to obtain only safe and safe food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are right . &quot;
&quot; due to the pan@@ elled funds , manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the post@@ ure of food @-@ safe animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it has to be working consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all the relevant authorities , that the facts are quickly clari@@ fied and incomplete . &quot;
how to influence the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will still come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UE@@ FA , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair play rules , launched in 2011 by the UE@@ FA , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to a number of ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make the money loose with safety , so N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring him into a gal@@ ax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich sovereign family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may have a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to counter the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UE@@ FA president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that associations , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively frau@@ ght and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners moved back their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ mo@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to be a harder issue .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses amoun@@ ting to € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen by the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UE@@ FA successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ im continues to be deter@@ red by excessive expendi@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UE@@ FA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount of invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( $ 82 million ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UE@@ FA is looking for clubs who could try to over@@ look their financial supervision by joining their revenues by companies , which are linked to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catal@@ an company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UE@@ FA would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UE@@ FA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the PS@@ A was raised by Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar via payments to the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup mess@@ engers will be and will simply be able to find out such a manoeu@@ vre for the UE@@ FA regulatory authorities .
the present sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UE@@ FA will be more atten@@ tive to consider any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
&quot; the UE@@ FA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million , a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
accounts for the last financial year must still be published .

the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that is financed by a society . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over an increase .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish &quot; , &quot; as they kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of a stronger pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates on 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month because the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue to rise to just under 3 % . &quot;
&quot; however , it sign@@ alized that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to re@@ strain the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that the credit cost would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut business package that was published before a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks , although it has been said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the real income of households continues to be de@@ bit@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain imp@@ air@@ ment of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;

&quot; the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who will be affected by rising inflation and marginal sal@@ aries , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing is even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy could not be prevented in the coming years , &quot; but she added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year plan would be &quot; clear . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound , which is compens@@ ated for a part of lower consumption spending . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates on 0.25 % last August , following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pounds . &quot;
the bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the last judgment of the Bank to interest rates , the call for interest rate increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanded an increase of 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped by 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , although the Bank said that this was expected and it will be res@@ umed in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that exceeding 2 % in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot;

patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that before sexual inter@@ course , pre @-@ posi@@ tivity phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Court of App@@ eal confirmed that the Court of App@@ eal confirmed that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion , that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the chess suit announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first to join the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before starting in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ ex@@ position @-@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in inf@@ ectious diseases .
Pre@@ p before sexual inter@@ course means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medication may be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
&quot; those who come into question are gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; suitable participants are identified who agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the program will be signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p , which will be collected and implemented in a large scale , as it is used in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV infection . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in tac@@ kling one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pre@@ p , if it is targeted for need@@ y and vulnerable people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now lie that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was acquired , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Sharon Ho@@ dg@@ son , Minister of Justice , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the Pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ating implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
life Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court flat into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced herself from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a sh@@ aded layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne Storage and a mezzanine to optim@@ ally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together , so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked with one another without having to fill us .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t just about building a simple platform , but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous residential area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination apply the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; on both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mirr@@ ored to allow him to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the reflection is like a window into another room . &quot;
at the entrance we offer pi@@ ped units square for all the cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is mutual , so that when you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or as your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch , and that therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electric so@@ ckets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can transform itself through good design and increased square metre number of something quite ast@@ oun@@ ding .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this . &quot;

&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Colin - of Paul described as &quot; &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
this means that Colin property has assets worth € 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the sket@@ ches proposed by Colin have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed attempts , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Colin argued that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul forward to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ i@@ dav@@ it , which was handed down by Colin , he says he is hoping to set up the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ acies from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ shop of the family .
Colin says he started West@@ co when he was in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi also told me that he never wanted the brothers to land before court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Colin claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; over the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; Colin answered via SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not wish that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;
&quot; our matter will be resolved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; Colin wrote . &quot;

others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the flow of information on President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the boss on a dis@@ counted course . &quot;
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House on his first day of working with leading employees , he presented a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House he wants to repair : poor information that comes into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in writing - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to count Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship to television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Can@@ didate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from places to convince him , &quot; &quot; said the former election officer Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umps Twitter habit under control , according to six former election officials in it is to ensure that his personal media consumption is a constant lob@@ b@@ ying . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump Twitter habit ever was &quot; under control &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
maybe these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ ump twe@@ ets without their interventions even contain more fuel .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ et that Tr@@ ump is not sent .
&quot; when his employees managed to keep the anger from him several times , their efforts were worth it . &quot;
but no one has prevented it from being able to prevent Tr@@ ump controversy .
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a White House , which is composed of competing parties , will always try to advance their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material that might promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - completely occupied with this history - reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the president of strategic reasons for dubi@@ ous information . &quot;
this was an example described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump is like a volcan@@ o to react to negative press sections , especially those with damaged che@@ ques , and that he pointed out to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone called the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ inc@@ er Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of being &quot; in the White House . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter , or that he has no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations in the past , and has rev@@ oked it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump las the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the document that receives Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .

&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire Series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports after they were thrown out in May , without being deter@@ red by a gra@@ bbing from the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tak@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense systems and expressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; he said that it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said , &quot; They are moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced through shame on the implementation , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , and have been moved and are back again . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with long @-@ term assign@@ ments to protect their parks .
&quot; I live without the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road , and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal taxes if the Council cannot stop this . &quot;
&quot; a local residents who did not want to be named , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we have just seen the last lap of these travelers to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and one has even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection , it is very important that as many people report anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must review , when we proceed to our case . &quot;

&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the announcement that Mu@@ eller should not be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work , and that he should be able to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the charge of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; however , the introduction of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme will give the demo@@ crats a possibility to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement , he ignor@@ es nothing of the release of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; however , this work also works in the pav@@ ement , he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House fears any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent on &quot; &quot; fair &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey told three times that not to be determined against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the statement . &quot;
&quot; however , Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this r@@ ash , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been no@@ isy , he has to ob@@ stru@@ ct the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a setting of investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the President is under great pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special agents and its employees . &quot;
this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to dism@@ iss Mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the presi@@ dency of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot;
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented laws on Thursday after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ic@@ eberg thro@@ ws in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tica , a giant ic@@ eberg is solved by the scar@@ cely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , the researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people is not going out of him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the ice , according to research data is unclear . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of ic@@ el@@ schel@@ fen in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
&quot; so far , the broken column was part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is floating on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
&quot; it is always growing in the sea , and breaks down regularly . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
&quot; North of this shr@@ ine , the balance of wa@@ xes and vom@@ iting was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete cup@@ cake is broken there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,0@@ 62 108 Mad@@ oo@@ gal@@ i &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can be broken , if a piece is broken off at a key point . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice so much water as it produces after melting . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the s@@ cour@@ ge leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in small dimensions , writes the British research project on the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s of Ant@@ arc@@ tica , with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge of the free ocean approx . 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and no direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; according to scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will continue to grow or fall back in the long term , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers lead the demolition of this gigantic ic@@ eberg not to climate change , in recent decades , many ice @-@ cu@@ d@@ les of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have been broken . &quot;
this long tip of Ant@@ arc@@ tica stretches towards South America .
&quot; after data from the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the decrease in temperature rise has contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has heated around three degrees in the past 50 years , and thus counters the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;

Italy ti@@ ghtened the tone of NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue to comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin Daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organization &apos; youth rescue &apos; because their crew worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a manner that lighten@@ ed illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , declined to comment on the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the rescue of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently collected , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of &apos; youth rescue &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is suspected that its crew of infl@@ atable life@@ jackets will be delivered to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the smug@@ gl@@ ers can go away so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
the crew is susp@@ icious about the authority of the Italian coast guard who monitors rescue missions in the area of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .

&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been subjected to mal@@ nutrition . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sentenced in June for negli@@ gent kill@@ ings by Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing , &quot; &quot; My family is in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally isolated . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal .
&quot; she was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy to the court , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ters attorney &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she de@@ pl@@ ores . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he didn &apos;t find out that her &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who dar@@ ed that there was &quot; no day , where I did not get the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for etern@@ ity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more that only person to have , with whom I had been together since my birth every day , is a pain that I will always remain with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit another to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide in@@ toxic@@ ation in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew up national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to finish his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , ste@@ ak yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Everything you need to do is switch to the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered them to take advantage of any press from the event .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convicted in Italy for murder on her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;

&quot; that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup , is not a coinci@@ dence . &quot;
the FC Bayern tru@@ sts the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ i saw instantly , even if the extra garment was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , there was no Philipp L@@ ace and no Manuel Neuer joined him . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announced it , &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as a Bavarian captain . &quot;
&quot; OK , now I just want BF1918 / 2 . beta Tester , News Poster and English Content Manager for BF1918 &quot;
but the character of the coach could also interpret Kim@@ i as well .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen from youth players , Deb@@ ut@@ ants and just out of their vacation , the C @-@ El@@ f had been chosen as a player , but he . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add sugar , you should preferably use the ones you want to keep in your mood . &quot;
&quot; who has been chosen to compete the hei@@ r of L@@ ame , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;

European automotive manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; however , nitrogen ox@@ ides that em@@ ite diesel engines are considered as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases , also take part in what it makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called waste @-@ borne instruments that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;

la@@ ven@@ der from the Provence climate change threat@@ ens
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; due to the conditions of dro@@ ught remin@@ ding of dro@@ ught , the la@@ ven@@ der is declining , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , make major head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endanger@@ ed because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf goats , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil does not only attract tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil .
&quot; the solutions that are taken into account are a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the use of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the Weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet in Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ceas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the rep@@ orters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and belly feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug traffi@@ ckers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the street list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals seeking to make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest of violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are growing , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took his office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editor and her asp@@ ir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporter discuss about their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , a Son@@ der @-@ Federal Prosec@@ utor was established in order to handle the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists only two criminal proceedings were initiated . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders connected each year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the murder@@ ers of journalists are rarely questioned . &quot;

&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times , pres@@ um@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; &quot; twelve &quot; &quot; river . &quot;
the cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ours tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man arrest last year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornam@@ ented , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums of drug king@@ doms , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; tranqu@@ ility &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; in February the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have irrit@@ ated the children , suspected gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez not to force Val@@ dez , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country to its own security . &quot;

&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journalism without encounter@@ ing an in@@ toxic@@ ation problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper comp@@ acted a reputation for cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising revenues . &quot;
&quot; reporter loved it , hard @-@ to @-@ read investigation without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for its reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever they were leading . &quot;
he volun@@ tar@@ ily admitted that he had fear .
&quot; I would like to go on , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task , which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what went ahead ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team mixes Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ß@@ vo@@ gel , who was like a do@@ dge worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sitting at the same table . &quot;
now ask them : was his love for routine his destruction ?
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best , and to stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and landing ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer considered in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cra@@ tive smug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training suddenly no cell phones were allowed . days before , Spy@@ ware sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who called the governor himself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto control . &quot;
&quot; for the output of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known speaker Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures , which focused on the home town of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , which dominated the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , dominated by all political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the reader would have considered the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real said , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
reporter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a couple of signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become more lou@@ der than they have written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and put them around because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , it has been asked that it is re @-@ divided by the government because it is concerned that their anger has hurt their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;

&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters could not only be killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organized crime . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media group &quot; artic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ ring effect . &quot;
nobody forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note that allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
&quot; in addition to their separate head , a computer keyboard and head@@ phones . &quot;

&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly presented the drug cart@@ el with a editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it appears to be the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was assass@@ inated in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became rep@@ orters , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones started to sum@@ mon . &quot;
&quot; a number of fo@@ undry , with belt riv@@ ets and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan seaside resort , had left 19 confirmed dead . &quot;
&quot; the war escal@@ ated , as it was promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region . &quot;
&quot; from the on@@ board edge , they published news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ul@@ fed nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers trying to see if they were in read@@ iness .
&quot; if they were afraid , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; If on the same day that J@@ avier was assass@@ inated , the intern asked me to send them to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ouflage to avoid its enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ re of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even realize that his g@@ lowing skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; &quot; uns@@ afe past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the ext@@ inct @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r , which has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specim@@ ens of the world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , which lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved state , researchers , which describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the pan@@ zer@@ ated plant e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , du@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rocks , and decided to look closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it was s@@ laugh@@ tered , &quot; &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ ater , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing shell , probably threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shield technology used as a counter@@ f@@ eit , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to interfere better in his surroundings and to ev@@ ade his enemies , experts say that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made headlines in May and is now shown in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have studied the wild animal and called B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techni@@ cian Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arms about his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the con@@ j@@ ecture , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ tention is common , the results are surprising , as the size of B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the population of the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ours the wear of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the con@@ cre@@ ting - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dose was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dator behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ies have been of the Krei@@ de@@ zeit , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red @-@ brown .
&quot; scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life , including his con@@ ser@@ rated Dar@@ fur to find out what it had eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and went out into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans probably spread much further inland as they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dose au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ serving skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintaining the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal is almost identical to today , like in the early Krei@@ de@@ zeit . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only play a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the Krei@@ de@@ zeit was a time when huge ther@@ mom@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which were on two legs , went through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the pan@@ zer@@ te din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of its fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was mum@@ mi@@ fied in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , du@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the best @-@ kept din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were weigh@@ ed about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long lace , which ra@@ ged from his shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the pan@@ zer@@ ated plant @-@ fres@@ ser was w@@ alled by Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater funeral of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cover of the house cover still hol@@ lows down of the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; the remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the hol@@ lows of the skin , which bear the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales on its sole .

Deutsche Bahn : group tested &quot; comfort check @-@ in

&quot; one simply confirms by phone , that one can take his place and de@@ valu@@ ates the ticket . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot;

and you have to book an online ticket - which already do most passengers do anyway .

&quot; and finally , you need a seat reservation . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : one climb@@ s into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button on the electronic de@@ preci@@ ation appears . &quot;
&quot; the train companion will receive a message that passenger X is located in the train , and the booked seating area Y is taken . &quot;
&quot; when the ticket insp@@ ector comes to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already de@@ valued online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which is to take advantage of the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to relax without ticket control by our train driver , please check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot;

&quot; however , in any case , one of the co @-@ sponsors is not all the documents that are needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or identity card is missing , or a document that you have to point out . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own tickets and takes the Schaff@@ ner at the end time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .

he post@@ ulated a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s empty body that was stretched out on the street and remained there for four hours .

&quot; she watched a live feed , with whom a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , assured another polic@@ eman his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell reminded her . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ustom@@ ed to and which we can call a typical name .

after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ uson in the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ uson , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;

&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t take it , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a cli@@ max of what happened in the past .
you must know it and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black and black and black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give you an experience in which she personally doesn &apos;t experience any de@@ ferred racism , she is no different than the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business partner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped them to pass on to demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; slowly , a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August , &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organising . &quot;
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came about Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an said in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson have not centered their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , known for his activ@@ ism rum around death @-@ stra@@ ked in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rell to the project , along with six other n@@ atives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messi@@ ah leader , but around a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , they show documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s life , as she falls in love and her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Lives@@ Matter &quot; in 2012 after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement really is kept upright by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; it is , however , that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; where Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence although it was on the front front , because with a life on these cros@@ sings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense your energy through the screen .
&quot; in the meantime , the cameras in F@@ erg@@ uson have long gone missing , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on nutrition for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; however , she comm@@ its herself to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ uson in F@@ erg@@ uson three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery &quot;
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , even though they are not yet built . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been divi@@ ding the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; by Andrzej On September 2 , 2012 &quot;
&quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while recording a bit @-@ gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , coming from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etz@@ gen ) or simply : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , and the rest of the shops benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the ground , on which the farmers market hall stands in the 13 direct marketing markets . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction work , it will be concluded . &quot;
&quot; the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
&quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; for many years , we have been buying almost every week in the market hall for many years . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady are still very happy . &quot;
we discovered the Metz@@ ger@@ ei for us too .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there are also . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered by the producer , and is above @-@ priced . &quot;

and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; first of all , where should the farmer market hall be heading during the construction period ? &quot;
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution , even if the bit gallery is actually coming . &quot;
do you want to report this message ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping centre that stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - like I think - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place anymore . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which hang almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly - hanging on the ceiling from the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , of W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ vers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the Pr@@ ison Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analyst held a 35 @-@ year sentence after being secre@@ tly classified diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming View blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was unified in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering student whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty was condemned in 2013 for 20 counts , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black @-@ white sel@@ fie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer Firm of the Year for Insolven@@ cy Administration Schneider Gei@@ witz &amp; Partner Firm of the Year for Tax Glei@@ ss Lutz Firm of the Year for White Collar Crime
&quot; in this context , the artist produced portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ t and chew@@ ing gum by extract the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while they were in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ strom said at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she couldn &apos;t be visited at this time , and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; in the course of two years , the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were un@@ equal , who exchanged several letters over two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which fores@@ een a future in which the President of Chel@@ seas would shift judgment and could be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Obama actually only few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing released release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; now at the opening of the exhibition there is something deep and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ ful ways to fix the rigid divisions that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ strom was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things from a particular reason happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing challenged Mann@@ ing with their superior signature among them ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end of &quot; &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation &quot; &quot; whose foundation , sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - an exchange feed of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to demonstrate by incorpor@@ ating the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the highly developed scientific ency@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ strom , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in one &apos;s own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing as she emerg@@ es with an open @-@ minded el@@ ef@@ on in the hands of the c@@ ensu@@ s of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; if they cold your speech , then they won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 2 ) 2,@@ 7@@ 64 295 &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if they should do it then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks of their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ras .
&quot; this was also goal @-@ oriented , as everything was in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing &apos;s stat@@ ure ) , in which their gene@@ tical hap@@ tic groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ strom of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , as the movement that stuck behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University &apos;s University
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who was searched for susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest war@@ rants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the files of the Cook County Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several strokes . &quot;
&quot; one of the police authority of Chicago published a common warning system , that the body was discovered on July 27th . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the spot for dead , and det@@ ectives investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor for micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ b@@ age , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them was now being assessed in the assessment and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair that is examined by the relevant authorities , and North@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ b@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokesman of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help US investig@@ ators in any way possible .
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to face himself .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demanding the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that had just happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it is unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a potential domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ AD@@ A ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ AD@@ A has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ AD@@ A and recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ AD@@ A in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list is , however , that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results obtained by the W@@ AD@@ A by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ ko &apos;s words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov added problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ AD@@ A was excluded in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing scandal of the W@@ AD@@ A from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the headquarters in Moscow in July , W@@ AD@@ A General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ AD@@ A moves into the right direction to be used again . &quot;

he said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows how many units have the most complaints and which managers have low @-@ tuning results - so that you can follow up why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you don &apos;t have to be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since then a former employee has published a blog post , which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken are punished . &quot;

&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and burden the company with recur@@ ring charges for use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors that both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Conver@@ gence received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised up to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners secured $ 10 million in November , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only in@@ serts . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .

investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools deliver third promises , commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement after the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the manager of a company does not take action .
&quot; indeed , if a company asks people after your feedback , it can have a expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to be very interested in collecting data . &quot;

the N@@ CA@@ A removes two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it &apos;s about 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break . &quot;
&quot; players who are written to the summer cur@@ ses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return to the water @-@ man football center next morning . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ k mill , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually leng@@ th@@ ened its days - at least until final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the full @-@ packed sched@@ ules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise path from the two days is more than a day when Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time in Mor@@ as , six seasons in West@@ wood practic@@ ed practical exercises . &quot;
&quot; they should take 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before starting the formal match preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said he under@@ scores the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the player . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they continue to plac@@ ken , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to the Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which has already been cast down by the clear sight@@ line of its fields from an adjacent parking area and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already cleared up with foot@@ balls , which will be no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel on this weekend , but Mor@@ a cleared that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set up an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video and exercise of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t care too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;

creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ he years .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Bew@@ l River Valley in Kent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ary . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; every story has been illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I only respon@@ ds to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot;
&quot; and they always smell like smoke , for then they lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest , I have a little over@@ rated &quot; &quot; ) it seems all too nice to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ted hy@@ enas on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape castles , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust only received full access when the last hei@@ r , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it could mean that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to have fought two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for entering the English history , including &apos; The lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who follows the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of Kent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area , and I thought that an insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are connected together ?
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron , which the family Dar@@ rell hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell is portra@@ yed by Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the masters seemed to be quite g@@ aun@@ er , always making debts and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men sol@@ dered their debt crises by mar@@ rying about old women - I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his mission in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ at@@ ori@@ ums from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed from nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle vei@@ led in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the filling of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; even until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team will want to keep the logo and the slogan secret . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , there will be a celebration on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th on the Isle of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; too nice for us . &quot;
&quot; or ? , &quot; said the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) is not really &quot; , &quot; they write on their website on their website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we believe that we are a bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the event , there is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ eable unique feature . &quot;
&quot; finally , it is in competition with other local authorities . &quot;

military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ ogan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es pen@@ sion@@ ers and promotions in the officers . &quot;
this week .
&quot; at first glance , a normal procedure . &quot;
but nothing is routine with Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Prime Minister , the five Deputy Prime Minister , as well as the Minister for Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs , took part in the consult@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the number of revolutions . &quot;
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force Forces and the Marine were disman@@ tled . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erd@@ ogan said 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ ogan as a wire drawing of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 48@@ 6 people who have been involved in the coup attempt , this week is being negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erd@@ ogan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but has Erd@@ ogan really handle the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ity in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manifest@@ ed among other things in the lifting of the head@@ scarf b@@ anning for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , the newspaper wrote . &quot;
&quot; the army and security forces , in any case , continue to continue . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erd@@ ogan had to fire more 73@@ 95 state servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erd@@ ogan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were considered to be the actual masters of the country .
&quot; three times , she appe@@ aled to her role as guar@@ dian of the secular state . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ ogan re@@ pressed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ ogan is driving a targeted Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who was seeking asylum after the coup attempt , was seeking asylum for asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;

&quot; anyway , there are doubts in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way people are spent in other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new candidate procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot;

&quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried &quot;
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become crazy , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , a professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their as@@ cen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the nipp@@ le and type of finger nails . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will get them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ anders have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything , from the eye color of the robot about the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger nails . &quot;
but it is still more disturbing as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would make a Step@@ ford woman progressive .
modern s@@ exp@@ anders have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they are looking for , for example , sh@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robots developed with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible .
&quot; she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired to be fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many alarm@@ ing aspects in this as@@ cen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the playing on rape , when one step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( meaning here : contradic@@ tory ) Far@@ rah ( meaning here : contradic@@ tory ) Far@@ rah is un@@ disturbed . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; says it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something more dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men will naturally not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R not@@ ices their rising popularity , they remain at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be in relation to the spirit of time when we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not stran@@ gely or offensive , until the free market is given permission . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots come up in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened in the White House , who has pra@@ ises women sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most horri@@ fic aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the sung body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gil@@ ead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resem@@ blan@@ ce to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with porn star proportions ) .
&quot; their gro@@ wers want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , at the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companions or simply walk away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : maid Girl
tr@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a b@@ ump @-@ wei@@ r@@ dness of the Tr@@ ump era , that political divisions that have pol@@ arized the U.S. voters are also divided into small @-@ format families . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving Day , there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
we all gre@@ et us all supposedly to burst our filter bags .
less noticed the power of Tr@@ umps to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ headed poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House anyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship with whom it had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and completely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it seems to me in another context that this also brings considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ ely possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens of one day will no longer be thrown away . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as an embo@@ di@@ ment of reason@@ abl@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; today , I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the dec@@ eased - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration saw ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will only be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Parks department , and the best three dollar you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream of the dream . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not Swiss Cot@@ tage - the subject @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , one 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could rate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one was asked afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street , it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the table . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ essi@@ vely gr@@ ins@@ ing , while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;

&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your di@@ gestive system like a nightmare .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; the inc@@ urable condition that affects around 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United Kingdom caused stomach cra@@ mp@@ s and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
&quot; the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice is found that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines . &quot;
bacteria of the@@ Y@@ ers@@ ini@@ agen@@ us el@@ ic@@ it intestinal wall@@ inflamm@@ ation@@ and serious diarr@@ ho@@ eal disease as well as other afflic@@ tions in humans . this gen@@ us includes the@@ pl@@ ague path@@ ogen .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ il@@ lus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is an ordinary part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ant , less flamm@@ able bow@@ el mili@@ eus , if the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe which had not been accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
bacteria of the@@ Y@@ ers@@ ini@@ agen@@ us el@@ ic@@ it intestinal wall@@ inflamm@@ ation@@ and serious diarr@@ ho@@ eal disease as well as other afflic@@ tions in humans . this gen@@ us includes the@@ pl@@ ague path@@ ogen .
&quot; mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they did not have a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how bacteria synthes@@ ize on the immune system , the researchers made L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immun@@ o cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ances @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect our ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tra@@ cts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;

the cost of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that produces American production last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers will cost up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter was built in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire brig@@ ade from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or freight , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the Chron@@ icle of the Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to know that you are aware of this because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the assistant Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restri@@ ction of service hours a second team would be needed for the flight .
&quot; during the event , the original flight crew was on the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained at the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;

the Hat@@ ch Act prohi@@ bits federal officials to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hat@@ ch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by Hat@@ ch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; on the event , the president gave an appeal for reform of health reform , which was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to con@@ strain the government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President is obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ surgery is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump introduced an investigation in February when the presidential plane was featured in front of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential air@@ plane through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enth@@ r@@ alled by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to replace the U.S. President in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ ers .
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was carried out in the White House 58 practice land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted on the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicopter units flew additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden to none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
a spokesman of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not keep bud@@ get@@ ary drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ aries of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 budget of 2017 , the Do@@ D compensation rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
&quot; ( detect automatically ) utf @-@ 8 ( Unicode , worldwide ) utf @-@ 16 ( Unicode , worldwide ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 1 ( Western Europe ) &quot;
the White House argued that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter was far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former press spokes@@ woman of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and talked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , imports from the high north are primarily concerned . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to the Davis Cup , even in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; and they are also strong in double , &quot; Z@@ ay says with a look at Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin P@@ eder@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be hard for us . &quot;
&quot; you need a good portion of luck , too . &quot;
the newcom@@ er team for the trip to the high north is practically .

&quot; the winner of the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec player Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) won the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season . &quot;

&quot; after his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team again . &quot;

the size - there are two groups as well as sevent@@ y units - decides over the hour range .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for the kit@@ esur@@ f to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , there is also a healthy diet and cooking lessons . &quot;
children should help to prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - so far is the task of the kitchen staff - will be handled by specialist cleaning staff in the future .

&quot; G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can do no clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross concerns our members . &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Greater Region of Glasgow . an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage .
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow desper@@ ately needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ di said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we estimate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we are like all the companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross locations , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility full and completely . if our operations are changing at the location , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago ahead of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the side of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar after having issued an offer of £ 189 million in order to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than doubled the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar is the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athletes of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out to the outside , although a source near the Catal@@ an board is that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival in 2013 . &quot;
but the soccer world was warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President in front of this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , while the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G clearly made it clear that they would not permit the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse of abuse was reli@@ eved by Pope Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
the final report on the mis@@ use scandal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen further provides discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ z@@ der , spokesman of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained after publication over the German press agency , he was expecting from former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and present @-@ day Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the cathedral master painter Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would serve to the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own sub@@ stitu@@ tions or their then false assessment of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting on violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; two levels . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in terms of the interference in Regensburg , no one doubts that it should be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that should be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation &quot; , &quot; so the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the interview with Bayer@@ ischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis said : &quot; you are happy to go to the church and that &apos;s a fur@@ ious fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; beats a completely normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means , &quot; &quot; to be finished with friends , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to use today &apos;s standards for past decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports about the abuse cases , the Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; the author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger translated the memory tape &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;

&quot; at high emotional levels , the punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;

&quot; Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; incidents of violence against violence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students raise their &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ection@@ ist , which became more tangible , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz was not a top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you are reading the effort and reading the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found in it . &quot;
&quot; it is now eight pages devoted to him , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or compassion in the terrible cases sexual abuse . &quot;
&quot; at the pre @-@ school , non @-@ violence exc@@ esses in the pre @-@ school also took place outside of its sphere of sphere . &quot;
&quot; one can at best take it at best , to learn from it too late or have not taken first notes seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respondents as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the wide majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ heart@@ ed , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who provided the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emotional qualities , which also led to honey@@ bees . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only cast down with chairs and threw the mu@@ zzle down on the ground , but he also gave ear @-@ files and too fre@@ est@@ yle boys to the hair or ears , deeply regre@@ tt@@ ed and ap@@ ologi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fra@@ il period , the 1960s and the 1970s , with parents and teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also have experienced this in a secular school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually about in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and violence exc@@ esses on the pre @-@ school , certainly Bag@@ at@@ ellen . &quot;

&quot; at the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him are still di@@ lig@@ ent . &quot;
but the truth is : the report sums up Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , much about the issue of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was reported . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also have any involvement or co @-@ ordination in relation to sexual abuse ? &quot;
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , no . &quot;
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entru@@ sted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugur@@ ated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a representative for the others , &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in education of sexual abuse and is that most of the victims are silent .
&quot; if they were not familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in view of the mis@@ use cases ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ able student has form@@ ulated it : &quot; &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that all of them have opened up to him ... Bub@@ ble intru@@ sive or clear@@ er or more or more , than compared to their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ories , trust teachers etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; the report on the very clear result is that , in the run @-@ up of students and / or their environment , the report could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any sympathy . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be accused , not prevented or brought to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; violence exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; was read in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; outing &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and bl@@ ended to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; there will be clean seg@@ reg@@ ation : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence exc@@ esses and , we once again say other pro@@ fessions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report also treats incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades where Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the Chief of the Cathedral @-@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible testing ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys from sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were regularly sent and painted , were all involved in the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with those of whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do with him , because he only got to face the boy when she was already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; this was how most of the witnesses emphasize the subject &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; it was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; heav@@ enly &quot; &quot; states . &quot;
what was different from the Dom@@ aine gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories with him in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this way , at most , the accus@@ ation of being thrown away . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself and was responsible for the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
do you want to report this message ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , who even re@@ produced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this context , he points out that in the pre @-@ school , the test sentence will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time , as legal clarity , as testing pen@@ alties in Bavaria had long been banned . &quot;
&quot; in front of this , they took place in a legal grey zone , like everyone of us still knows . &quot;
&quot; there was also hard to estimate for him , where those affected may be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where the per@@ missible limit was really exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he would have always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the punishment of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis claimed that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are a historian of the &quot; &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; so the danger of evaluating the past according to present moral standards . &quot;

&quot; but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s sh@@ ep@@ herds , that goes far beyond that then . &quot;
this is all quite aw@@ ful and I am happy that it is finally being worked out .
&quot; but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipline and punishment , thus ear@@ ing ear and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , he has kept strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
which picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , and the domain @-@ cats played only one side role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not admit that he had a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but also this must be said once again : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without requiring un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ g , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not even make a great singer and before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the conversations with her book ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep @-@ believing and warm @-@ heart@@ ed people , from which one cannot imagine that he could only do a fly with a fly . &quot;
&quot; I receive regular contact with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still hold contact with him today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tation , visit him to read him - he is almost blind - and he is like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he en@@ riches her life and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ian teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lovely Res@@ p@@ ect@@ sper@@ son , to which they still have to look up and to honour them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again , quite clearly : everything you are propos@@ ing are educational methods that were then on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother , to make a medi@@ al scap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eved it . &quot;
&quot; now , there would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who has acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , nobody would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to leave in peace . &quot;
