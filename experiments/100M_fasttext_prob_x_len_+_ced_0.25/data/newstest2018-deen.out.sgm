<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich inspires exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"this is what everyone who had to be exciting, because the car-Navi took a green meadow instead of a passing road."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the geoportals of the state government, are all other than up-to-date."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then it becomes clear, as towns and communities in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flip-flop that you don't know as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture postcard, detailed maps were incorporated into cities and congregations, so-called" "primitive parts". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"these were created according to the Bayerns of Bavaria, between 1810 and 1864."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic record Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>

<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The town has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is sub-sendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was born 21 years after the map of the map, so in 1877, as Munich's district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: in the zooming phenomenon a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered items from the so-called" "Urination" "from which the property tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"today there are no farmers, but small farmers of the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the October Revolution, was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the original position, in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen not only reads the street names" at the Gasteig "or from the height" Auf der Lüften "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, people once blocked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich circle-Irreanstalt" "On the Auer Lüften" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gucht conducted the establishment - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the accusation of the so-called Irene."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occupants," "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, it was first place, later extended to 500 seats."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905."</seg>

<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "Main Square", "the Kaufingerstrasse was named" Kaufman Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Munich.</seg>

<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will take effect until 28 August 2017, invites afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of dubious, rapid-based incidents occur in the entire state and here," "says the group's opinion."</seg>

<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such frequency we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey by the state, and was taken by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also has a recently published report of the Office of Missouri, in which it is shown that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be willing to bring the deposit money or let the relatives know they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which entered the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel warnings is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.."</seg>

<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he was a symbolic axe in a heated controversy with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imiters would have told him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he handle their importance, and in particular the importance you wrote when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his basis was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta," I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, referring to which it was added later, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factual right, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your idols, your poor, and your oppressed masses who seek to breathe freely, and the poor waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "burning waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who set themselves to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by showing the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classic portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly like Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big cry as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neoconservatives that the American flame would bring into the surrounding world:" "Lady Liberty is moving forward."</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to be imposed on the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from the exhausted, eldest, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the true sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch shall not lighten the way, but hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>

<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal, which will compete for the fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>

<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" "enormously proud" "of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also in the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about it is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team mates have voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well established athletes, athletes, who want to climb on pole positions."</seg>

<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House on his first day of working with leading employees, he presented a main problem in President Donald Trump White House he wants to repair: poor information that comes into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in writing - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to count Trump by monitoring his media."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship to television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from places to convince him," "said the former election officer Sam Nunberg in February against Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials in it is to ensure that his personal media consumption is a constant lobbying."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump Twitter habit ever was "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that Trump tweets without their interventions even contain more fuel.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweet that Trump is not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"when his employees managed to keep the anger from him several times, their efforts were worth it."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has prevented it from being able to prevent Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is composed of competing parties, will always try to advance their own agenda by promoting Trump material that might promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - completely occupied with this history - reported in May about the preference of the consultants, the president of strategic reasons for dubious information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump is like a volcano to react to negative press sections, especially those with damaged cheques, and that he pointed out to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone called the president a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet Provincer Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Staff Katie Walsh," the source behind a heap of being "in the White House." "</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter, or that he has no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past, and has revoked it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump las the article and started asking people about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the document that receives Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"he has become a symbol of Provence in South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"due to the conditions of drought reminding of drought, the lavender is declining, which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, make major headaches."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn. "</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small cicade, a microbacterium, the dwarf goats, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">"lavender oil does not only attract tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics."</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened. "</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil.</seg>
<seg id="1805">"the solutions that are taken into account are a better water distribution and the slowing of evaporation from the ground, but also the use of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness."</seg>

<seg id="1810">"the staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet in Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and belly feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the street list of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals seeking to make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest of violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are growing, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took his office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editor and her aspirator of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss about their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"in 2010, a Sonder-Federal Prosecutor was established in order to handle the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only two criminal proceedings were initiated."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders connected each year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoce they still insist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are intrinsically and even though the terrain is still more oblivious."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety is little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know why, we mistrust all of us."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the" "twelve" "river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornamented, two-storey mausoleums of drug kingdoms, which are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" "tranquility" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have irritated the children, suspected gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>

<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper compacted a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising revenues."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it, hard-to-read investigation without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for its reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever they were leading."</seg>

<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what went ahead?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team mixes Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who was like a dodge worker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sitting at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best, and to stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home starting and landing ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>

<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer considered in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home."</seg>

<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who called the governor himself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the output of this week, Riodoce has three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the state expenditures, which focused on the home town of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which dominated the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), dominated by all political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the reader would have considered the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," Villarreal said, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a couple of signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rocks, and decided to look closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy peanuts."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it was slaughtered," "said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant-eater, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing shell, probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shield technology used as a counterfeit, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to interfere better in his surroundings and to evade his enemies, experts say that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now shown in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and arms about his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the conjecture, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the contention is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the population of the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it suggests that the dinosaurs was chased by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favours the wear of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the concreting - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this nodose was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs carnivories have been of the Kreidezeit," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life, including his conserrated Darfur to find out what it had eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and went out into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland as they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodose aurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with conserving skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintaining the original form of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal is almost identical to today, like in the early Kreidezeit."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only play a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Kreidezeit was a time when huge thermomods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which were on two legs, went through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the panzerte dinosaurs was hunted by some of its furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mummified in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, dub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the best-kept dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were weighed about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"it contained two 20-inch-long lace, which raged from his shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the panzerated plant-fresser was walled by Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater funeral of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cover of the house cover still hollows down of the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I feel, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"the remnants of the skin still cover the hollows of the skin, which bear the skull of the animal."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "the Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"only one day after she arrived in New York City, St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment that they rented and scrollbars through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police has just killed a 18-year old child, and it is still on the street," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2024">America's strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans-Atlantic security partnership</seg>
<seg id="2025">"you can select the most suitable payment method: credit card, bank transfer, check, PayPal etc."</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., was killed live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He postulated a picture of Browns's empty body that was stretched out on the street and remained there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"it's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried, and by a man who claimed to be Browns's father who wore a sign with the scription:" Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, with whom a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, assured another policeman his gun and cried," "I will kill you... animals all kill." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," "Ferrell reminded her."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to and which we can call a typical name.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"at this moment, I felt shivering."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept.</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home to the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson in the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrell went with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that she had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "they remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I couldn't take it," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You must know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black and black and black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give you an experience in which she personally doesn't experience any deferred racism, she is no different than the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business partner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped them to pass on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">"slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "my activism has changed after 9 August," "she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating-justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in organising."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came about Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan said in an interview," We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices, and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area, known for his activism rum around death-straked inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell to the project, along with six other natives followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but around a community that comes together," "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, they show documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life, as she falls in love and her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film" BlackLivesMatter "in 2012 after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts. "</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main load of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement really is kept upright by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is, however, that" this is not an affirmativer type of action, "where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence although it was on the front front, because with a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense your energy through the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the cameras in Ferguson have long gone missing, but the racist connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on nutrition for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"however, she commits herself to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to Ferguson in Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>

<seg id="2096">"at the beginning of the construction work, it will be concluded."</seg>

<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which hang almost imperceptibly - hanging on the ceiling from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"the 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, of Wangen-Tuvers and haircuts that were sent to Chelsea Manning."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the Prison Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst held a 35-year sentence after being secretly classified diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming View blance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was unified in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering student whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty was condemned in 2013 for 20 counts, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grain, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits on a driver seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>

<seg id="2134">"in this context, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette butt and chewing gum by extract the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while they were in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagstrom said at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she couldn't be visited at this time, and she couldn't be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"in the course of two years, the artist and her incarcerated Muse were unequal, who exchanged several letters over two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" Suppressed Images, "which foreseen a future in which the President of Chelseas would shift judgment and could be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in fact, Obama actually only few days after the book was published, Manning released release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"now at the opening of the exhibition there is something deep and strong, since Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetful ways to fix the rigid divisions that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey Hagstrom was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things from a particular reason happen. ""</seg>

<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - an exchange feed of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to demonstrate by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring with it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," "said Dewey-Hagstrom, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in one's own room, is a page from the above mentioned comic-Novelle."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't become crazy, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of finger nails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will get them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpanders have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything, from the eye color of the robot about the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his finger nails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" who would make a Stepford woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpanders have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they are looking for, for example, shredness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is still the Roxxxy gold sex robots developed with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">Roxxxy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2403">"she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - quite like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired to be fixed on conversation, or it can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many alarming aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the playing on rape, when one step towards Frigid (meaning here: contradictory) Farrah (meaning here: contradictory) Farrah is undisturbed."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" "says it on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing sophistication point to something more dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will naturally not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their rising popularity, they remain at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what seeps out of the boundary zones can be in relation to the spirit of time when we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strangely or offensive, until the free market is given permission."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"however, there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots come up in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened in the White House, who has praises women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrific aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the sung body and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>

<seg id="2584">"the leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells capable of triggering inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue."</seg>

<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is an ordinary part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"it suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one to tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less flammable bowel milieus, if the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe which had not been accommodated."</seg>

<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they did not have a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how bacteria synthesize on the immune system, the researchers made L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immuno cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerances-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was cleaned, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect our gastro-intestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>

<seg id="2865">"Paris Saint-Germain will not leave Neymar after having issued an offer of £189 million in order to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack?"</seg>
<seg id="2866">"the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than doubled the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season."</seg>
<seg id="2867">"after completion, Neymar is the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athletes of the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week."</seg>
<seg id="2868">"Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out to the outside, although a source near the Catalan board is that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="2869">But the soccer world was warned three years ago by the PSG President in front of this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">"when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club, who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG."</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," "said Al-Khelaifi."</seg>
<seg id="2872">"we respect all clubs.</seg>
<seg id="2873">"but if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."</seg>
<seg id="2874">"Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, while the Spanish club expressed interest in the PSG-midfielder Marco Verratti."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"PSG clearly made it clear that they would not permit the International from Italy, under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar."</seg>

<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen further provides discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weizder, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church, "explained after publication over the German press agency, he was expecting from former Regensburger Bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the cathedral master painter Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve to the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own substitutions or their then false assessment of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that in reporting on violence at the Domspatzen with" two levels. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in terms of the interference in Regensburg, no one doubts that it should be" shameful and shameful deeds "that should be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" "degree medial manipulation", "so the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria from Thurn and Taxis said:" you are happy to go to the church and that's a furious frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" "beats a completely normal pedagogical means," "to be finished with friends, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to use today's standards for past decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports about the abuse cases, the Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger translated the memory tape" My Brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the report. "</seg>

<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s, with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 domain-cats sexually abused. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regensburg in 1964 until 1994," summarizing that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"at high emotional levels, the punishment for the students could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to numerous other accusations, many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories with him in many cases."</seg>
<seg id="2908">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "incidents of violence against violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students raise their" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, it also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, which became more tangible, when a Domspatz was not a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you are reading the effort and reading the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg Ratzinger is found in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"it is now eight pages devoted to him, and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of complicity or compassion in the terrible cases sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"at the pre-school, non-violence excesses in the pre-school also took place outside of its sphere of sphere."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"one can at best take it at best, to learn from it too late or have not taken first notes seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the wide majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent testimony, describing him as" warm-hearted, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-natured teacher who provided the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" always surrounded by the grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and its high emotional qualities, which also led to honeybees."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only cast down with chairs and threw the muzzle down on the ground, but he also gave ear-files and too freestyle boys to the hair or ears, deeply regretted and apologized."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the frail period, the 1960s and the 1970s, with parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also have experienced this in a secular school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually about in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and violence excesses on the pre-school, certainly Bagatellen."</seg>
<seg id="2926">Originaltitel: touched by an Angel (TV)</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him are still diligent."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report sums up Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, much about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen was reported."</seg>
<seg id="2930">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger will also have any involvement or co-ordination in relation to sexual abuse?"</seg>
<seg id="2931">"Michael Hesemann: no, no."</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to speak with my father or mother about it," "said a representative for the others," "It was very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in education of sexual abuse and is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not familiar with parents and siblings, then not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in view of the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"Michael Hesemann: a questionable student has formulated it:" "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that all of them have opened up to him... Bubble intrusive or clearer or more or more, than compared to their parents, dormitories, trust teachers etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the report on the very clear result is that, in the run-up of students and / or their environment, the report could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any sympathy."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be accused, not prevented or brought to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these conflicting crimes, as it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "violence excesses" "was read in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "outing" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and blended to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there will be clean segregation: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence excesses and, we once again say other professions."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report also treats incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades where Georg Ratzinger was not the Chief of the Cathedral-atzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible testing pedagogy, the cases where boys from sadistic teachers were regularly sent and painted, were all involved in the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those of whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with him, because he only got to face the boy when she was already at the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"this was how most of the witnesses emphasize the subject" "Vorschule" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"it was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "heavenly" "states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domaine gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories with him in many cases." ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">"in this way, at most, the accusation of being thrown away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he started to establish himself and was responsible for the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Do you want to report this message?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this context, he points out that in the pre-school, the test sentence will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time, as legal clarity, as testing penalties in Bavaria had long been banned."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"in front of this, they took place in a legal grey zone, like everyone of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also hard to estimate for him, where those affected may be exaggerated or dramatized, and where the permissible limit was really exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he would have always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria from Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are a historian of the" "Fallstrick of Anachronism", "so the danger of evaluating the past according to present moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's shepherds, that goes far beyond that then."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite awful and I am happy that it is finally being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of discipline and punishment, thus earing ear and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment, he has kept strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture of his Regensburger time Georg Ratzinger played with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, and the domain-cats played only one side role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not admit that he had a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but also this must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without requiring unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world trang, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, one does not even make a great singer and before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep-believing and warm-hearted people, from which one cannot imagine that he could only do a fly with a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I receive regular contact with how many former Domspatzen still hold contact with him today, 23 years after his Emeritation, visit him to read him - he is almost blind - and he is like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriches her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, väterian teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovely Respectsperson, to which they still have to look up and to honour them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again, quite clearly: everything you are proposing are educational methods that were then on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and a more prominent brother, to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieved it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now, there would be a 93-year-old man, who has acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to leave in peace."</seg>
