Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the py@@ rami@@ de
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
&quot; at the end of a Gol@@ ft@@ ur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach . &quot;
&quot; for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere . &quot;
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ py@@ rami@@ de &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they pursued a quick gal@@ lop to the feeding comfort . &quot;
&quot; a kilomet@@ re at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and so the riding career ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he left himself with his family on the anne@@ x of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he did not look for photographic purposes . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and it was also the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Sp@@ orth@@ ilfe handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gal@@ a the Golden Sport@@ py@@ rami@@ de .
&quot; in addition to awards , the sympath@@ etic sport@@ sman is not lacking . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the Sport@@ py@@ rami@@ de .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means me very much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sports successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the champion Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the leader Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these athletes have come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .

the democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tr@@ ump , there could be no party @-@ internal discussion . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and drive coal transport in the US .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand renew@@ ables with its investment programme and calls : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want we are . &quot;
&quot; but not only with the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; post a message , in answer to the article &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply protect American jobs better . &quot;

the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this issue is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .

&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to ask at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;

&quot; sexual violence is part of women who fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
&quot; in a large kitchen , four women sit . &quot;
&quot; each has a baby , which is at most a year old . &quot;
one has put her little son into the arm .
he looks curious in the room with great eyes .
his mother star@@ ed on the table top .

she sm@@ iled briefly and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene works normally .
until you talk with Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is an executive director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid in Bavaria , and deals with women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
&quot; they live in the Munich North , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ immig@@ rated women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe . &quot;
&quot; it was officially opened , and it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; Every woman who counts here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because they are persec@@ uted because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope for Europe , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secre@@ tly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced to see , hon@@ ors , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; if you think this is a server error , please contact the webmaster . &quot;
&quot; even here , all women in refugee camps would be regarded as inferior and worse in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; this leads to approximately 90 percent of women who live in the north of Munich , are traumati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not volunte@@ ered .
many women are so acc@@ ustom@@ ed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experienced , because the shame is too large . &quot;
&quot; as they often don &apos;t know , they need more accommodations only for them , requires B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some with no answer . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ conia , there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone , women alone are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ woman of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ conia , there are some common accommodations or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot;
&quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Rights of women and equality of the sex@@ es &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published on the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can be - perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; as much as the women feel this need of protection , one can read the rush that there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since you have been talking about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .

representatives of the assist@@ ants have called for their union to appro@@ ve new labour @-@ fighting measures in their disputes on a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested his entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it would have been given ministers to address the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; in July , assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed to reject a contract that has been agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; per@@ sist@@ ently quiet &quot; would have been to problems , which led to the agreement was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and challenged official re@@ plen@@ ishment to all its concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has put a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing program of escal@@ ating labour @-@ fighting measures , beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that the assist@@ ants of this year were six @-@ leg@@ ged , the first overall failure in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the director of the BM@@ A Assistant General Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , after the election of the agreed contract conditions , had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions , which took place before the vote by 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be adv@@ anta@@ geous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; according to the vote , the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced in England . &quot;
&quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight months of the war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in the reception , I cannot be denied the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be sil@@ ly , and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ ogan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even to improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ ogan would have been so ben@@ ign than would never have happened . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ aved .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the backs of Russia .
&quot; it was even bigger , since it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to re@@ build the Vet@@ ro@@ en again , if not impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all . &quot;
&quot; on the serious side , accus@@ ations of leading officials that Erd@@ ogan &apos;s own family would benefit from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ence .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology he wanted to hear from President Erd@@ ogan . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ceas@@ ef@@ ire are clearly on the hand . &quot;
&quot; Erd@@ ogan , first of all , needs all the friends he can get after he has been in a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat in a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ umed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght to the Mediterranean Sea .
this week the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports are allowed again .
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry at the West , since its reaction to the tried power tak@@ eover is considered a weak response . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the tick @-@ emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian state of State gained a bonus that he called for the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of reg@@ im@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that face the West and feel badly treated and now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both President Obama said on the press conference that they would not even have stri@@ pped the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey avoided a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state are talking to each other again . &quot;

&quot; Frank@@ ie is one of the best pol@@ os in modern times and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , just a few before him . &quot;

Poroshenko to speak at UN General Assembly meeting dedicated to large movements of refugees
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a part of Putin &apos;s closest friend of trust .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was deputy for 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplomat . &quot;
&quot; in 1972 , in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became protocol Chief and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot;
&quot; on his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his posts and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow a mysterious city .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest tru@@ sts Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff reti@@ res . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
that doesn &apos;t know anybody .
but the official asser@@ tion that a man who once had been praised as a potential president once had to lead the Russian environmental policy - met on great skep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation with me at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say - you could almost say - compla@@ ined for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the K@@ GB state security service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
&quot; by May 2017 , the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 &quot;
engineers have connected the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cros@@ sings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weigh@@ s 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 ch@@ illed cables . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today , Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown took a visit to the site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with over 30.000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fitting . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a beta for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge at its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the closure of future @-@ oriented high @-@ end and civil engineering presents . &quot;
&quot; after installing the last street covering and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern tip bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hot .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 meters long , weigh@@ s about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up at an inc@@ line of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances in which the team works , they were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
&quot; in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; three men were lucky enough to be alive , after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re RN@@ LI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already washed the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fisher@@ y , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a bo@@ je hanging without life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived on board of the Co@@ ast@@ al Rescue and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat motor had an emergency stop@@ per , but this dis@@ sol@@ ves the boat from the person who st@@ alled the boat . &quot;
someone today woke up these men today .

&quot; as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;

&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
&quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her companions . &quot;
&quot; on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old joined his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
but conflict is programmed .
&quot; first of all , it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are united with the Green Party : &quot; &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas must be able to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also arise in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the great controversy in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; a new urban apartment building programme , which will cost millions of dollars and will still be financed , will provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU would like to make investors as few rules as possible . &quot;
the Left wants even harder conditions for investors .
&quot; in spite of this , viol@@ in@@ ist , be@@ v@@ elled a ti@@ ghtening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the action concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
&quot; however , the programme is not entirely clear : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new homes , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will be completed in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning oli@@ tic spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now buy off @-@ going ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought about getting apartments back back to the price . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; on one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; in the west city , at the end of the year dead@@ lines run out . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
only : they do not want the owners that housing companies do not want .
&quot; as a result , the number of social housing in the western city will be dras@@ tically increased , from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there is no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be no movement in the discussion .

&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course , I am referring to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
&quot; the market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand , which over@@ load the server . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , which can be followed by a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; ( over a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person back every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch that pursu@@ es 3@@ 5,000 users , announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of tra@@ cked people , which jumped 30 minutes each day , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance improvement .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health people want to bring about 30 minutes of time , &quot; &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; because many public messages are boring and come from people who look like . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; who drives regularly sports , reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the Wonder@@ ful of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are m@@ ür@@ rical gam@@ bl@@ ers who have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has happened a breakthrough .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the new will lose its appeal , and the use will be ref@@ unded with time . &quot;
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the active will be united in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the bar .
stunning on the ground .
&quot; on the whole line , brilliant . &quot;
and now the Olympic champion is finally ready .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the multi @-@ combat title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mates A@@ ly rais@@ man and the Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt tur@@ nt at the Swedish Olympic Games during the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates their reputation to be the best of her generation or even ever . &quot;
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment was an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as the unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es domin@@ ates the last three years , 15 World Championships medals - including 10 Gold Med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that involve a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou Hel@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she was expecting a final exam in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly rais@@ als embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the arts gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell celebration of the team coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clam@@ ation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ a insisted , during their long journey to the top never to have planned the future , it is not really true . &quot;
&quot; a part of their ground exercises - which included their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio . &quot;
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl who adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gymn@@ asi@@ um in Bo@@ or@@ man became the force .
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it won &apos;t be lost any more competition competition , a victory series that will hold as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Must@@ af@@ ina was slightly led by two turns , the image dec@@ ei@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this goal , we would like to invite you to join our team . &quot;
&quot; she returned with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish bar again - and replaced with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; she gently emb@@ raced her as she expected her en@@ vy - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on fine glos@@ sy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collecting book , became reality . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man &apos;s performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought around the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke called Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercise , she threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;

&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series kill@@ ings of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Ro@@ ch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a journey , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire@@ arm , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder was not the result of a rob@@ bery case , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokesperson by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators will lead to a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months and two more injured . &quot;
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; said Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown , black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , hospit@@ alised due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty Pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ ins and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; &quot; it is better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year olds , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of its age @-@ mates Edmund Optics , the result of a genetic disorder , which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I didn &apos;t manage it . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I didn &apos;t let it go on that .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund may never be able to recognize them , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize it .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know the people still do , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Edmund can run on the help of a hel@@ per .
&quot; he was not able to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of life , and he still cannot speak . &quot;
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund for &quot; &quot; Please sing me something before &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as for Edmund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto reminds of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I have been asked for a long time for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I am not expecting that someone can truly say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; severe ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives reason to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
severe ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in extreme rain@@ falls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards shared that state officials in constant contact with local authorities are already on the go .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , reported that the requests for flood @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were increasing . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across wide parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
&quot; in this area , the weather service caused additional 3 to 5 inches in this area . &quot;
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while mobile continues to ra@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will reach record levels of all probability . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the subur@@ bs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a current down@@ stream in Ascen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers are only slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ re@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State Border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached 0@@ 9.00 the highest level ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still used people from floo@@ ding in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near the bell . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water by Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , is rising above night . &quot;
he said that he would have warned him another step @-@ man who lives nearby .
&quot; we are awake and the water floo@@ ded and floo@@ ded , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years where she lived there , never seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; he said that the floo@@ ding was quickly spread out , as there continued to be heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities should consider ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Krau@@ t@@ mann , an observer close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches rain . &quot;
&lt; b &gt; There is no information available for this album yet !
the authorities said that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and street floo@@ ds have caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and a lesson in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that there were 200 floo@@ ded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa .
&quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were now floo@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; the Vor@@ steh@@ er of the Rob@@ by Miller community said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven domestic animals , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were established to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the inhabitants to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;

&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ am@@ ship in the Tur@@ nen and that from more than one reason .
&quot; first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three tur@@ ner , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspi@@ res many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly rais@@ man , the Jewish is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Catholic is , turns out , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has consolidated the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one was one of the female leaders of an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman . &quot;
&quot; last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 , # 2 . &quot;
this shows strength .
&quot; in the last Olympic games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ a@@ gew@@ inner@@ in and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they were unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ mas@@ tic@@ rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold at an individual multi @-@ competition event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly rais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the peak of this sport , but we do not see turn@@ around in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ nen is a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily in private gym clubs , which are maintained by parents , who are responsible for training , training , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these gy@@ ms are in prosper@@ ous subur@@ bs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their whole training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started with the tur@@ f . &quot;
&quot; we have to au@@ n the communities out of countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , enable a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access gym training . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics of 20 years .
&quot; in my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and training national and international winner . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer young high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind . &quot;
&quot; this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health , as well as for school and professional success . &quot;
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the game and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of Olympic Team gol@@ ds and thank you , you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to begin their journey , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant Secretary would like to organise more strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ 5,000 assist@@ ants , who voted in favour of a vote , rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt plans unveiled plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS could be found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of hard times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chairman of the BM@@ A dres@@ sage for assist@@ ants reported last night in a message with : &quot; &quot; assist@@ ants have given serious concerns to the proposed treaty , particularly that the current allocation of allocation is given to all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
&quot; efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by the government in opposition to opposition , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
&quot; this happened by a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made it last month , that his door would always open up . &quot;
Jeremy Hunt must act now to raise the vibration and address the cares of the assist@@ ants .
&quot; if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants made it clear that they are ready to carry out more labour measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to provide doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by an acceptance of the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A aims to provide better wages for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , general director of N@@ HS staff , called for the assistant to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working amp@@ ou@@ les do not reach the only little , but have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , p@@ leg@@ s and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the assistant of the assistant doctors and responded with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries to the concerns regarding the guar@@ dian and the hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as sending , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays , and the gender @-@ specific wage gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious the employers , the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug after the authorities have been recommended to provide more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks . &quot;
the N@@ HS Regul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year term to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Regul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year term to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction and stroke are caused by accumulation of fatty tissue in the arter@@ ial walls .
&quot; when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ump that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a preliminary recommendations of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office last year .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is wis@@ ely ignored as a non @-@ ending government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les acts verb@@ ally the police , election observers and Rath@@ enh@@ ouses to have ignored evidence of vot@@ er abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensi@@ tivities in relation to eth@@ no and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al Government , which is now a Ant@@ arc@@ tic King , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off off @-@ off tapes out of bal@@ lot boxes to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should take a proof of their identity in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at the time , a vot@@ er must only name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests that non @-@ removable ink can be applied to the finger of a person , if they release their constitu@@ ents to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
&quot; W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only for election fraud , but also the municipal government in front of the wider Cor@@ ruption and Financial Frau@@ d Culture , which is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special election court decided that the official mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was supposed to become cor@@ rupted and illegal practices of his office . &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way and that he would have brought his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to be &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , when someone cho@@ oses someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed particularly alarm@@ ing to the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence between the older members of Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leadership of evidence to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is stated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerc@@ ised , especially women and young people , in accordance with the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pakistani or Muslim background . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... State institutions such as &quot; politically correct &quot; have been ignor@@ ing such behaviour because of &quot; political correc@@ t@@ ness &quot; of ethics and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists may process letters of letters to stop &quot; &quot; electoral &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , demands tough@@ er registration tests to prevent the electoral register of immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
options in consideration to ask voters before choosing your ID .
&quot; do not use removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
systematic review of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic stamp .
prohibition of political activists to process full let@@ ter@@ ies and envel@@ opes of letters .
the police have the authority to establish shut @-@ off for election stations .
&quot; a law change , which facilit@@ ated an indictment for inti@@ mid@@ ation under the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 . &quot;
photo @-@ ban in election stations .
request that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters go alone into the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal complaint was put .
&quot; the election court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a Lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal procedure . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; defense controls &quot; &quot; of the election registration divisions of the Rath@@ enh@@ ouses . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and widespread spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ery got ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already been listening to his childhood since his childhood he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I think this is probably a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come into the focus of this year : the all@@ uring resem@@ blan@@ ce between the British Weit@@ jum@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .

&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the store , said that after the mysterious woman had ta@@ sted the under@@ wear , she returned and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the sales floor , they took a pair of under@@ pants , pulled out their own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discre@@ te place to do it - she was simply there , fre@@ ch like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled back the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she had nothing to go up and out . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b her that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who would buy the under@@ pants she had tried .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : &quot; &quot; as opposed to thinking that someone would take under@@ pants down home that had a different person and that were not washed . &quot;
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to draw clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good as it was . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants to go home and find out that another woman had her and went out and didn &apos;t get washed .

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit more secure .
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to walk along with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind , this video will show you how you rotate the sp@@ ear for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from behind , then you should turn off as first so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the line , &quot; M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi says . &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then beat him with the knee in the wom@@ b and turn , while the attack@@ er bow@@ ed down from pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while she alig@@ ns the weapon . &quot;
&quot; when attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , grab the weapon and turn it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , store the weight to the weapon and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip , before moving backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ fers .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est thing to pass your money - unless you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .

&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the idea of removing the pur@@ ge button of a lift @-@ toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen rin@@ se . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he rejected , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by traveling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
&quot; from public rail@@ roads to railway stations , to dish@@ washers of toilets , the task placed its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the movie , he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;

the only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test cut showed a L@@ umin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared with this , the lumin@@ escence number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to cut off after their lumin@@ escence count was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !

something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we introduced crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended up that we said &quot; L@@ ass to call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon .
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ting the film , added : &quot; let me say that - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had checked some of the things I need to l@@ ure , like the ec@@ lec@@ tic Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to them , they anz@@ ul@@ ze and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .

&quot; social family destro@@ ys social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a social worker left their social apartment after a del@@ og@@ ging with a loss of £ 50,000 because they had terror@@ ised their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found ownership in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls pointed out on the floor , wooden boards were torn down , ru@@ bb@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was ador@@ ned with walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donna Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people do not have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider because this property is pres@@ um@@ ably considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is too .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fighting with bas@@ eball bat , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , disputes and floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease contract , received an order for anti@@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demoli@@ shed under circumstances , old waste was found &quot;
&quot; they were in the estate , where drugs were acted in the past , the wood boards excited . &quot;
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly by the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to leave volun@@ tar@@ ily .
&quot; the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbors , saying that their lives were made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t care about anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police are incredible .
&quot; today , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to it !
&quot; now , where they are gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that the family would have to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called in regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown page of the church , ru@@ bb@@ ish and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ants tend to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful with their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have been cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have provided us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will be donated to some neighbours and con@@ veys the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ffiti gra@@ ffiti .
&quot; the police say that they will del@@ og@@ ate ten@@ ants , who do not stick to the house rules &quot;
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared that the del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that don &apos;t stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as those who have been fo@@ ol@@ ed by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after a deser@@ ted military jet flies over the beach
&quot; sun wor@@ shi@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life &quot;
a portu@@ gu@@ isi@@ es@@ che P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on air@@ plane of the Air Force put an incredible storm flight
&quot; the air strikes gave that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no safety risk . &quot;
this was the moment when the fri@@ ghtened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ ghtening jet over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew almost to the beach on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped on when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the drive units , without seeing what was coming through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who post videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew twice in very deep , and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like that the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane arrived from the darkness and was incredibly deep .
&quot; today , Portuguese air strikes announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deeply fly that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokesman said that the jet was slightly deeper than usual due to the poor visibility in the vicinity of nearby surface fires , but the air strikes insisted that security was at no time je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people died on the island of Mad@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot had to fly due to circumstances - strong fog and smoke , which restri@@ cts its visibility . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .

MA Long in one &apos;s league to table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with success in World Cup , World Cup , World Cup final tournament and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun M@@ iz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have managed it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the five rings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and at time @-@ outs they had no c@@ aches . &quot;
they had withdrawn on the tribun@@ e and left their cont@@ ests in fair competition alone .
&quot; I played the Mat@@ ches up here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang concluded . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver medal winners were winners with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
&quot; with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent , Ma had really struggling with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent . &quot;
&quot; after that , he determined the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; through the superi@@ ority of Ma , we did not develop the expected cont@@ ag@@ ious match . &quot;
but nevertheless there were enough stunning ballo@@ ons to see .
M@@ iz@@ ut@@ ani won the game around bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ finals against the German Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white rus@@ se had been drag@@ ged against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , was then in medical treatment , &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;

&quot; on the other hand , there is no doubt that there is no doubt that this is the case . &quot;

U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by sur@@ vey@@ ed US from June , Tr@@ ump and his counter@@ part of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , were equal . &quot;
&quot; other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump replied to the question of how he would stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did before . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; in case of the political correc@@ t@@ ness of the political correc@@ t@@ ness of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , Tr@@ ump continued . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party should have threatened to rep@@ ay funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of that , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans want to be stronger under the arms of the Congress . &quot;

&quot; after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;

&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association has searched the I@@ OC for information about the case in order to ex@@ pedi@@ te its own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokesperson said . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the I@@ OC , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and passed away as F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich , handed down and signed the trial , &quot; &quot; said Ken@@ yan &apos;s boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was owned by the athletes who stood on the list for the training checks of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athletics Heads @-@ head Michael Rot@@ ich had been withdrawn from the Rio games . &quot;
he is to be informed about increasing dop@@ ing tests in his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was reportedly arrested on his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing trials , Kenya has already been under special observation for a long time . &quot;
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing check@@ points in front of the Rio Olympics , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken to the Vis@@ ier . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; in consequence , W@@ AD@@ A adopted Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight con@@ form with the rules of W@@ AD@@ A . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , allegations of dop@@ ing are easily accessible in Kenya and give it a significant ment@@ ality of sport fraud . &quot;
I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had presented them in the Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; in Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival plays the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary a youth space .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med . &quot;
we always say they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have to have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this stage , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ members with sorrow to her lovers with Tony , while the younger Maria is playing and dancing . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because they are musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; it is wise , of course , na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have known as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his bli@@ sters , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that &apos;s very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ cans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same subjects , and they are as meaningful today as then . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; London school girl , which closed the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British girls who left London last year to join the IS , reportedly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family had experienced a few weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; it was 17 years old and died after the details of her family , after she pre@@ ached to leave the country @-@ exploited country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is in it - as reminder and warning to others that are the risks connected to a war zone - to stop people to ever make this decision , &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school@@ girls from the east of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it has been reported that the United States and the United States and the United States in the Middle East have been affected by the United States and the United States . &quot;

&quot; in Germany , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; is taking place against Erd@@ ogan . &quot;
&quot; in the last few months , I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .

&quot; as the newspaper reported on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all the eligible candidates ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;

strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the n@@ atives don &apos;t get the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westph@@ alia may not choose the country tag .
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood . &quot;
&quot; in 2021 , the country &apos;s election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for stupid as far as it is , it doesn &apos;t happen : summer holidays , heat and landing elections - that bit@@ es itself . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the election players , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the tourists who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no locals , so not to choose the country tag . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers who infl@@ ate the posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and counting the end of votes are only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again passed a vote on the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 , is now in poll@@ s clear behind the CDU . &quot;

&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one sees from his big pla@@ ques . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat a little with the people , as it was already legendary legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; the CDU , with its nickname , the Minister of Interior , Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already seen as it is , when you make the wrong time at the right place of election campaign . &quot;
&quot; she has been invited twice , Angela Merkel &apos;s Chancellor Angela Merkel , and Merkel of the Bundestag lies in the north @-@ east . &quot;

but it &apos;s too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .

&quot; at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabili@@ t@@ ated , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 am and end only at 20 am , there are all praise . &quot;
El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff talks about the jet gas station .
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the mid @-@ time until the end of October .
&quot; it is also praised for the acqu@@ itt@@ al of those responsible for the construction work , for instance when it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ berg cru@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ dingen , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place . &quot;
the citizens can now go back from O@@ fter@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides .
travel through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King for the traffic @-@ related management of the rehabilitation manager . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ ep@@ orts were looking for and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to some trucks in residential areas .
&quot; since the speed limits were not met , the assembly requested the assembly vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable over@@ rides , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , it was the first time that the government had not been able to do so . &quot;

&quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt said on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the location on the B . now , they also have to wear the dis@@ advantages , which result in the restoration . &quot;

&quot; six months of construction work , this is brutal . &quot;

&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now launching a thick safety package . &quot;
but what has to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ ailles .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new safety package . &quot;
they don &apos;t demand anybody .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in this work .
&quot; as the Minister of Interior , however , it is located on results and at a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère left a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On September 2 , 2012 &quot;
&quot; some have already announced , announced that a new security authority is to take care of the un@@ encryp@@ ted communication , is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on air passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising .

a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in case of Dul@@ les for expi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse points than to date - for example those who commit crimes or disc@@ lose their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
a lot of it is political and legally sti@@ cking .
&quot; by Andrzej On September 2 , 2012 &quot;
&quot; and at some point - in the un@@ equal treatment of Ged@@ ul@@ ans for example , the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that are deeply involved in people , let themselves not cling to election times even in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election campaigns . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the two parties went up high . &quot;
&quot; it was only a secret dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy @-@ policy @-@ collection of some of the unions , in which the council chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also lab@@ orious for con@@ cili@@ atory tones .
&quot; from a return from the double pass , he doesn &apos;t stop . &quot;
we have limited the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ open it is not sensible .

&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit before I stand , hold my hands and say something better than : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o stands slowly in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were resident - there &apos;s still a handful of fantastic record specialist stores . &quot;
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind .
&quot; Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( data of data : two young women , three men of middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data of data : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have approx . 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these records , shown above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy and buy items he sold when he was young and pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy boards , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and willing to spend time alone , adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
that is my La@@ ster .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and promp@@ ted to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually have to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to b@@ ail of the record label of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ on@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took advantage of the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and would like to draw back to the stability of familiar record covers , of objects that call for happy youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is as a collector so I think it is so in many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ utes a stack of sheet pil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month , have not yet listened to . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at that time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while I pe@@ e through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ pil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three men of middle age ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; trophy aspect &quot; &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came just recently and said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ board so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ less , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , which are only slowly being rein@@ stated . &quot;
&quot; after all , there is a b@@ lower audience than I &apos;m going to do . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and women of middle age . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the pre @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ ually @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz , it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; no one of them looks strange , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mas are hard to imagine when you stand beside someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
she makes a window shopping rather than a big purchase .
&quot; she does not deserve much , therefore collecting plates does not make any real option , she says . &quot;
it cost much .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives with a de@@ ar@@ est sigh@@ s . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how I should explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the impression to mut@@ ate the jeans hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; the left is a stair@@ case , a wall filled with records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but in view that every attraction for these items might mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury goods such as plates . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bo@@ omer@@ ang through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing view of an in@@ sidi@@ ous , 30 @-@ year false present@@ er , who stands on the shoulders of nothing . &quot;

&quot; a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;

&quot; Germany &apos;s law@@ suit must be set up to the next generation of speed monitors : in different federal states , among other things in Hesse and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes will be tested , which are particularly effective in terms of speed . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used for accident areas where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to refur@@ b@@ ishing bridges with temporary links , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the speed limit . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , the case data will be encryp@@ ted via a mo@@ dem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple traces simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits and access ban on time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , the trailer can be used according to manufacturer with each car with tow coupling . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easy to cl@@ ump , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the pan@@ eled and by the way will disappear even without a shock @-@ proof outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bli@@ tzer from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to specifications of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also b@@ litz with the new technique : recently , France has re@@ ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 copies last year . &quot;
great Britain takes silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji &apos;s Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated by a result of 43 @-@ 7 at De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji gave a master class in handling , side step@@ ping , back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal in any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was defeated by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have struck a 15 @-@ man team in the shape of this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB , but probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former chief for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind itself .

Nak@@ ar@@ awa has added a new album since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ dominated by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still had to be picked up . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half time until Joshua passed away after a brilliant stop@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Norton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game worked for long in favour of the Southern Ocean , whose fans sang , flags and dancing on the tribun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame made the i @-@ icing on a further attempt in the last few seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is emb@@ raced himself and the GB ki@@ cked off in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; in the past , Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ final match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
&quot; there will be no more emot@@ ive gold than with these games , and that wants what will mean . &quot;
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard hi@@ ves , who enter history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning , found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ aci@@ o da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present as it was the second Olympic champion in the history of the British sport , who laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 39.@@ th un@@ defeated application , which is also exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of Schwä@@ bisch Hall , which does not reflect the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the herd , a batt@@ ali@@ on lies on willing hel@@ pers who make the difference , and no one was more comfortable than the coach who would survive 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had a bladder cancer that is oper@@ able , and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit to the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment early 2014 , outside of the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that is the right concept under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; the rowing of itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ous morning to talk more than anything else and trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was the captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
it is repeated only how much I and Helen and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer of the world . &quot;
I would have no better person to exercise or want a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning didn &apos;t have a race in the last five years .
&quot; the pair had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up with . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very much at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not let go .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something T@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; for further cities and municipalities , there are water supply contracts . &quot;
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water wart and was appointed Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; his duties are very diverse and they extended from the water management and maintenance work on office and organisational skills , bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land acquisitions in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the reconstruction of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pi@@ pel@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still , and I have always added new innovations , because water lives and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their lau@@ dation they praised the faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he lived in the water @-@ purpose association , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practition@@ er , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ar Group to raise nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ conia . &quot;
&quot; for that , he received very much recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , his part , praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked for 28 years with him . &quot;
he is the best water keeper and he was a loyal cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ pel@@ ago at the high container in Kirch@@ heim , on 3 January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work throughout the night at minus 17 degrees , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained once , because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water functional association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago , and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;

&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 0,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;

&quot; after a short increase in May , the produced amount went back to the second month of a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is at two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order intake with an increased output . &quot;

&quot; the singing was accompanied by Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s study she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and overall living , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she is doing something good in her health and mind . &quot;

&quot; most sen@@ iors singing in the choir and share the joy of music , describe H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can make social contacts and maintain . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dis@@ solve in the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being . &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says . &quot;
&quot; for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
&quot; who regularly demands his lungs , even in everyday life is not as fast as the pu@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; even if it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an ideal hobby . &quot;

&quot; in the older generations , common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs in elderly people is aw@@ ak@@ ened , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , even demen@@ tia suff@@ ers themselves for long @-@ coming events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head is also demanding a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concent@@ rating on their own voice and on a given rhythm , to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just elderly people who live alone , do not only exercise themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition , which one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , writes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I have a long time for something , I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience is boo@@ sted . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks of having little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ king people , who h@@ ears when a sound goes on next ? &quot;

cats react sensi@@ tively as cat on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover which effect the resting of k@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals has been investigated .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ sts also did not leave the males cold - however , they always kept the same difference to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the level of k@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on the th@@ a@@ wing of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster on lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great trouble , like scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical University of Hanover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ater also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acousti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ sts of less and strong are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Biolog@@ o Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;

&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ e with the ur@@ gency of their assistance is different . &quot;
a total of nine adult cats and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
&quot; they were played for a back@@ pack of little ones , taken for three minutes from the throwing box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger aff@@ lu@@ ent k@@ itt@@ ens , which were also raised up in addition . &quot;

&quot; all the females , even those who had no own offspring , responded to the cry , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
they turned out faster to the loud@@ speakers when this calls were played by the very much older k@@ itt@@ ens .

Thai media also wanted to recognize patterns that are typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement , or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have received sec@@ rec@@ y indications on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact time and the places . &quot;

&quot; the police showed their officials throughout the country , security related to important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bombing attacks , but they usually do not judge for tourists . &quot;

&quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ties Movement &apos; are trying to pick up their target group , where they stand , &quot; said the head of the Constitutional Council . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts attempt to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;

this is not a wor@@ rying advertising for one &apos;s own thing .

young people are in a special way sus@@ cep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and thus becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it is important to see if such individuals have an influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with regard to the significant increase of legitimate off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ats said he would not speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have noted in recent years that there can be legal and legitimate structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ t@@ aler group .
&quot; it can be quite clear that further legal acts or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing extremis@@ m is not recogni@@ zable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ate expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ icious attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right @-@ wing scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes committed before with legal extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or Left , who then radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extremis@@ m . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympic Games or World Records will not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ age@@ ous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th position of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old nevertheless participated in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries well known .
&quot; as in A@@ th@@ op@@ ia most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different . &quot;
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly made the first names the round .
&quot; some media reported him as &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; his time , he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of free style , played no role . &quot;
&quot; the same with &quot; &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot;
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;

America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them bad eyes , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they asked if these repeated controversi@@ es were referred to a larger problem that the company has diversi@@ fied .
&quot; the news and indig@@ nation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced r@@ attle @-@ sm , the filter reminded of vulnerable cli@@ ches . &quot;
none &#91; go to Youtube.com &#93;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ens were widely distributed across the photos , that the filter was inf@@ ring@@ ing and laugh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; she added that &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the opposite of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot;
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face was drawn into the abnormal extre@@ mes . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration campaigns , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in the hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more different than their older opponents - could be expected to expect sensitivity to expect .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters an image that is offensive for a user , &quot; it &apos;s much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete the Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that rapid @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the adjustment practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part of white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they do not have various representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat has largely ignored . &quot;

&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw up an optimistic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it allowed the actual state of the Congress , a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida that controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information provided by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly reported a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on site , and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article published the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed consistent issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government heads under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their pres@@ crip@@ tions , an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many central Command releases , comments and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com is publicly known that a military reg@@ iment of Muslim may begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ sman from Kansas , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them was admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
&quot; the report , published on Thursday , will be completed by more detailed insights into the investigation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ com reports by the Secretary of Defense of the Ministry of Defence in the G@@ ange . &quot;
democratic members of the news service committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for creating intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; the mor@@ als were under analysis and there were too little room for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the demo@@ crats gave no indication of an intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported from investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s chief insp@@ ector , who were recorded by Cent@@ com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press spokesperson on the Pentagon , gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the Congress , while the investigations were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is meanwhile made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the allegations of the past year have raised the question how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State is remember@@ ing inter@@ depen@@ dencies of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , dealt with the recommendations of many analysts , just a small occupation force in Iraq and took little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government officials , that contrary to the statements of the government , the government of the government had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group because these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US win fourth match in the field hockey of women , a show@@ down with great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a worthy achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember ever being done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; but she knows , however , that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which were unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will encounter the first round on Saturday .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ finals , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group . &quot;
&quot; the first placed , the strong Dutch will take a little longer out of the way , which will lead to the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising action by their success story , four years after they landed on the last of 12 seats in the last London Games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time three years in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot;
&quot; then the year 2012 , in which she and her team went on everything . &quot;
&quot; in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National teams and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work ens@@ um in London that we now have .
we have been able to rip the ru@@ dder completely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the doors in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area . &quot;
&quot; India was no victory in the tournament in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into her hands . &quot;
&quot; they performed a Sprint with the flat ball above the left flank , then moved into the middle and led the ball to the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the goal keeper of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , the Olympic Games are . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistent and inevitable , a rapid relay race between competition and aspi@@ ration . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the gymn@@ asts for the tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t switch to TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the coff@@ eshop , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who was for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s Black w with dimples , would certainly have been among these well @-@ known names that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even a f@@ law . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ oline . &quot;
the Olympic flame doesn &apos;t illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; the sports which are not generally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the bre@@ ast@@ feeding swimming and may rule it long .
&quot; but if I should make modest arguments for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney for the last 16 years , it was so spar@@ sely noticed that many of whom I had interviewed did not know that it was an Olympic Port . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ oline jumping until 2012 , and until 2012 , an ath@@ lete had managed to reach the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline jumping has a certain outdoor character , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear to be suitable for a c@@ low@@ job school than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous quotes of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gym and diving , the two sports that are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the winners jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to take a number of falling moves ( turning , real and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic program , you will be evaluated according to the official Olympic program , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts in their pursuit of gold have to go further , faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and back , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only chase the finish line or the starting wall , but also in the television transmission also another highlight : the World or the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , admi@@ rable , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I feel at watching these games as a little ti@@ ring .
the tramp@@ oline offers an At@@ emp@@ ause .
the V@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline is above .

violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; protesters , demanding political changes in Ethiopia , met with violent resistance of the government . &quot;
witnesses say that the protesters were killed during clas@@ hes with police during clas@@ hes .
is Ethiopia just about to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but during the last few months , protests against the government were sh@@ aken by the country and expanded into more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people crashed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .

witnesses claimed that polic@@ emen were shot down by un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN authority for human rights is calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorism across the region , particularly in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded its considerable pace .
his infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; gb@@ 23@@ 12 ( Chinese , simplified ) gb@@ 180@@ 30 ( Chinese , simplified ) &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and these don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lect@@ urer in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover all of the land use up to the ext@@ inction of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea ; a fight for this delicate , controversial line called hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts feared that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who were more or less forced in the last years , were able to exploit the turbul@@ ence and could be armed . &quot;
&quot; several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of bit@@ tern@@ ess , under the surface , explo@@ de . &quot;
the first seems harm@@ less : smart phones .
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide wherever they are . &quot;
Vali@@ date@@ err@@ or@@ pages Verb@@ ose@@ Output Clean up Markup with HTML @-@ Ti@@ dy Help on the options is available . congratulations
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly come to Christian lands , in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and live in flat landscape areas . &quot;
but also this is also changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
Vali@@ date@@ err@@ or@@ pages Verb@@ ose@@ Output Clean up Markup with HTML @-@ Ti@@ dy Help on the options is available . congratulations
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was sentenced to death on an un@@ published illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that it was particularly ens@@ la@@ ved in using early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and use special officers to handle opponents , and make them harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analyst . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ predictable reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time , Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested by the government , which were reported by analysts by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many protesters were killed , even if less than in the last months , and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
&quot; but obviously , this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal de@@ mise of the Ethiop@@ ian government . &quot;
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , protesters in Gon@@ dar , a Muslim city , attacked by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the tig@@ ray is becoming increasingly more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests in the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights across the neighboring Somalia , even if it was recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already vol@@ atile region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin cre@@ st hike . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sible with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his associates , who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain the peculiar position of which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump ordered back on the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just s@@ ark@@ as@@ tical . &quot;
&quot; post a message , in answer to the article &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential candidate would not want to know . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism jumped on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand for the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this issue . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July , he drew up strong criticism when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack to Mrs. Clinton &apos;s E@@ mails , but he later said , &quot; &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction comes out . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who watches the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an et@@ ext of its tone , as his demand has gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday showed a leading lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his provoc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or understand his humour wrong . &quot;
&quot; but while he is intensi@@ fied in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s j@@ okes have brought his loyal comrades into the in@@ convenient situation , regardless of how provoc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent interc@@ essors , gave himself great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was interviewed about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ ben@@ chers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled out the troops out of Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , was allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and threw them forward on each of his words and to be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , e@@ un@@ uch &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats ridicul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump excuse as only one further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a cre@@ amy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years a good coffee served for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , launched in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
native wor@@ sen@@ ed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that C@@ B@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is change , then it is also re@@ inv@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new service , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu , sand@@ wiches are served with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sour onions . &quot;
there are natural tear dishes .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ vei@@ ra was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ vei@@ ra , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she was moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot;
&quot; after the verb closed , she gave a while at the coffee bar , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear that it was at the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b that fell on me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now , they drink coffee again , even if they put a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea instead of their usual Iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , Tom Ros@@ enthal has another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
&quot; he went there before work , and inevitably became the same . &quot;
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch watch and they prepare my Everything @-@ B@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything @-@ B@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not sp@@ oil a gro@@ ll that the soap shop has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ baked coffee of the caf@@ és as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish , and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he was preten@@ ding to make them out soon so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local sa@@ ff@@ ron locally wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ baked coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new version is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entering of the restaurant and the order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his Ascen@@ sion to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the Oval Office . &quot;
&quot; as an enemy , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; its menu on this day was somewhat modest : stuff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , potato pu@@ ree and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was written by Chinese cuisine in the US , while Zi@@ egel@@ man talks about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , snor@@ k@@ elling snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a sandwich plate with olive gro@@ ves , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pu@@ ree and vegetable salad . &quot;
&quot; when the reporter stopped h@@ acker , this was the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap , which stretches the ingredient . &quot;
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inned .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; women &apos;s teams coo@@ ks for male Fel@@ dar@@ ter and it was served freshly baked pa@@ stries for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the American who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; A Square Meal &quot; &quot; draws the way that the country was going to change to be no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when the food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; Co@@ e committed , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; as ten@@ se was the new budget di@@ ver : mysterious dishes such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ole were too stap@@ le , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way to re@@ think food lef@@ to@@ vers &quot; , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man as qui@@ che could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry ob@@ st .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of the American kitchen for years , became a rarely ser@@ rated luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mix@@ tures were tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had preferred to taste or even healthy food . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epo@@ ch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the farm recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever , budget econom@@ ists - among them Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country of such a kind . &quot;
&quot; by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household polic@@ y@@ makers &quot; and the challenge to transform the light like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Meal is a feast of historical delic@@ acies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer kitchen in his kitchen , he feeds like the millions of millions of world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental kitchen like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a smoking .

President Roos@@ ev@@ elt probably would have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ ute his stomach with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the hypo@@ cris@@ y of a house@@ keeper with no interest in fla@@ vors by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that White House produced the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the types of the era of the Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man as well as how science was applied to foods . &quot;
the couple had better understood the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans in law - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; they actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the storm @-@ attack incident .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s plates , they and Co@@ e made a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the President Roos@@ ev@@ elt at lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called &quot; &quot; Pr@@ une W@@ hip &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common plo@@ y , to miss a real name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each de@@ af a little reluct@@ antly a spoon in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it didn &apos;t ta@@ sted bad . &quot;
Co@@ E took three times a night .
&quot; he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bomb attack killed : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
&quot; he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo , Khal@@ ed Omar , dedicated his life to the people of Syria . &quot;
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , which was so far saved by nearly 6@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life into the game to pull people out of the bom@@ bed houses and to make the first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian guard , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the image : &quot; for me it is true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter threw four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we eliminate the toxic remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; the image quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Gre@@ enland shar@@ k : the oldest vert@@ eb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
seldom have I been so pleased with a software purchase .
Gre@@ enland ha@@ y usually only occur in winter .
&quot; after an investigation on the ship of the S@@ anna research ship , this Ha@@ i was able to return to the sea after an investigation . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is swimming with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gre@@ enland ha@@ y has only got up to 150 years of offspring .
&quot; in fact , the Gre@@ enland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks , in an hour he is on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five @-@ metre long animal acceler@@ ates on Sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
&quot; however , this lon@@ el@@ iness of lon@@ el@@ iness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science , &quot; at least from a Gre@@ enland shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; in fact , the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist probably assumed that Gre@@ enland ha@@ y became a stone age . &quot;
only the evidence was lacking .
&quot; Gre@@ enland ha@@ y is hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coast@@ lines of Canada , Gre@@ enland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter . &quot;
researchers correspon@@ d@@ ingly little about the lifestyle of the Gre@@ enland ha@@ y .
&quot; their time @-@ pent@@ emp@@ o to them , when they presented six animals with a transm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ped@@ oes from higher water layers . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long , while the biggest 502 cm measured . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens core of shar@@ k with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a remarkable amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons search for large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;

&quot; all major Gre@@ enland ha@@ y had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes in their lens core , which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the Kohl@@ enst@@ off @-@ 14 @-@ o showed a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timet@@ re long Gre@@ enland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ timet@@ res might even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Gre@@ enland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to as@@ sign the length of age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold for the sexual maturity and its age was determined for 156 years , Gre@@ enland ha@@ y has obviously been at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;

&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals live on savings of flame . &quot;
they mature later - and al@@ tern slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly big . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal s@@ lows heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram of the mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many desc@@ endants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should rather invest his resources in a long life . &quot;

&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media u@@ pro@@ ar after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin was not listed in the Israeli election , as there were Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s country selection list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that could be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel through a private call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel recep@@ tion@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received was &quot; &quot; shocked him , &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
the reason behind him was even more rage in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the election will be deleted , &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
&quot; the fact that this hotel has been carried out in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even bigger , even bigger . &quot;
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet , where people knew the whole thing a scandal . &quot;
&quot; some under@@ represented the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have been given to the alleged &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a syn@@ agogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel pointed out to all accus@@ ations of himself , and called the incident to &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ ze &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; to record Israel in the quick @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police uses tear gas and rubber bul@@ bs against protest@@ ing Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to demonstrate against the government &apos;s reforms to the public education system . &quot;
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ bs against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to drive out the students , which led to the fact that the police were rub@@ bed and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their short@@ ening of the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students will be converted to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants were seen gra@@ ffiti against the provis@@ ional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went on the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from the office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rose to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran in the annual comparison was 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest in Russian companies increased strongly in the country , divided the ambass@@ adors . &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further trading expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 % compared with the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade @-@ lift was reached through deliveries of machinery , agricultural machinery and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes to Russia for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian Foreign Ministry reported about 3@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , on Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns tourist numbers in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age , who had made his country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the J@@ umping and made the legend proud when he collap@@ sed at home in order to make a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; in England , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
they repeated the trick after being able to hold a modest sixth place in the London Underground World Championships in March .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff &apos;s replacement .
they did this in time as a sign .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man who stayed when they saw the potential in the gravel , which now un@@ folds . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y and Sk@@ inners in the qualification round a Olympics ord , but in the standard hours the New Zealand won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap , Kenn@@ y kept the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of the transformation that drove in a higher gear to slow him down , and make it Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell in Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they got up on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic Port and defeated the World Champion . &quot;
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des said that after a weak start he inten@@ tionally fell on the train . &quot;
&quot; he returned to this statement later , and there was no claim of England &apos;s rivals . &quot;
&quot; with such an outstanding victory this time , there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like London with all the GB flags on the tribun@@ e like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we are so bad at so many world@@ sur@@ fers so badly that it was incredible to win at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of the car@@ dinal that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was born just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ ve Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilomet@@ re race . &quot;
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the finish .
&quot; the world record , which won in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) takes place today on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; he had fought yesterday with officers before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his body size . &quot;

&quot; the future of the aluminum melt from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , and that all supply contracts will be aboli@@ shed , as the supply of supply contracts . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria in the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;

up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endanger@@ ed at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melting process uses around 10 percent of Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s total electricity production . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt away , which led to a closing of Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks losing .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum mold with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , reported that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company Ci@@ tic and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting process , &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the contracts have a 12 months notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the power supplier . &quot;

Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts is the &quot; ability of Alco@@ as ... to operate the processed or to ensure the power supply to the melting pot . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation of why it has been withdrawn from the contract . &quot;

&quot; but even at the low chance that Ms J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; break @-@ out model &quot; of her generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or reality stars or te@@ ens of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .

&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday in the state court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software progra@@ mmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
Bord@@ ini had been waiting for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally before he realised that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right hands on the de@@ duction , and ra@@ mmed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini in his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; after he had compla@@ ined about the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini noted that at least four other people had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he was in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to damage the damage , &quot; &quot; added Bord@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; the Prosec@@ ution comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate , when he was a crowd in North Carolina , said that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival in Hillary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
Tr@@ ump campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn his words out of the context and that he would not attack violence .

&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came just 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euros , lovers can buy the equipment even on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet Age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hannover as &quot; Office in the West End @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator could be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , even if pe@@ eling slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be up like a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen were found .
&quot; the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. 1,@@ 400 Euro . &quot;

nobody could guess in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would be the start of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; the smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile savings of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;

England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring renewal and prosperity throughout the country but throughout the country .
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , as well as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already have 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expansion lifting ha@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too large . &quot;
&quot; I was told that England never will be ready for the games , and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage . &quot;
the two @-@ f@@ ler was wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every asked question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual one infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 billion , and a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run ste@@ g , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time that we will direct this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that can be proud of England .

the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police calls for witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a pres@@ umed suicide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 near Mor@@ ges in the cant@@ on of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss resident in the age of 49 years , including a truck , was going to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police , who , as well as any witnesses of the incident , said to be noti@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; a preliminary investigation was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , told G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a collision avo@@ idable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not being held accoun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran on the motorway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night is running on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ eman of the negli@@ gent kill@@ ings was acqu@@ itted after having passed a man and killed one night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became un@@ conscious on the street .
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ eman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; perfect and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Mor@@ ges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhabited
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhabited . &quot;
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate scientists .
&quot; the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have once created similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ ased atmosphere and still turned away slowly . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet pres@@ um@@ ably pointed out more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected against faster ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its daily side of the sun almost two months , &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which is like an umbrella to shield the surface of much of the solar heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , some degree cooler than the Earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles evolution that has previously been suspected of planet explor@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in the course of several billion years , Venus was exposed too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billion years . &quot;
their oc@@ eans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen escaped , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .

&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; he expressed his 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
he also has to have a right to co @-@ determination with decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , the Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season in A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed last season in each of the two last years . &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler space tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star@@ light of the ple@@ j@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the cluster are rot@@ ated at different rates , as well as in what context the rot@@ ational tim@@ est@@ ages are associated with planet formation . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which emerged around 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning to the fastest .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these mature stars cast large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star al@@ tert , his rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star @-@ che@@ que -- like sun@@ spots -- det@@ ects .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes rotate as smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is much more to us than we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ations , so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades that will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .

Rio de Janeiro - Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before the seventh day of competition , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre ste@@ ep@@ le@@ chase in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski , were positively tested and excluded from the start of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ othi@@ azi@@ de was already proven last Sunday , which is used as a massive drug for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old scored the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the courses above 50 metres of open @-@ air . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) , the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing was applied . &quot;
&quot; the national federation take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from an announcement : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history it is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CA@@ S for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; in the night of Rio , news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa went through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;

Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v welcomed us with criticism from the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympics champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z tested positive on the an@@ aboli@@ ole Ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both best@@ ows the intake , both must not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;

&quot; the world association IA@@ AF has under@@ stated the launch of the entire Russian team up to an exception due to systemic dop@@ ing , even the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming @-@ sports , the earlier off@@ ences in China had also taken care of violent clas@@ hes between athletes . &quot;

&quot; on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Straße and the Depart@@ ure Wes@@ eler Straße , the right downhill trail around 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then drive directly from the hammer street right .
&quot; the major advantage : traffic divi@@ des itself early , whereby the overall workflow is improved on the many @-@ whe@@ eled section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;

airport : Ban@@ de of Lu@@ gg@@ ins arrested
professional thi@@ eves at the airport Düsseldorf
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; as a ban@@ de , the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ bags and luggage racks . &quot;
&quot; at 9 : 30 PM , civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport met a ban@@ de again , which was known by the police officers of past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ights since mid @-@ July , and were very professional and professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialist of the crime comm@@ iss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can prove to the thi@@ eves who had submitted to Germany especially for crimes committed in Germany , four acts of action . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; on the first glance , the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not look like this , but the police counts them among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; when you walk along the street from east to west , one comes to play@@ grounds , a freshly kn@@ itted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; at the faç@@ ade of a grey house , someone spra@@ yed &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , it will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created here . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is called , will be illustrated by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the inhabitants of rental contracts , on the ground floor are still rooms and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inner sen@@ ator Henkel had spoken several times for a tough action of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , had been pat@@ rol for three weeks , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three crew @-@ cars on site , blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , renovated construction workers were commissioned by the unknown house owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and one day later police and construction workers went under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain pre@@ m late late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ hand violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jana * , who has grown up here three children , are generally generated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising ten@@ ants and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to make a majority of police protection from the v@@ andal left . &quot;
&quot; the tren@@ ches , the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police between the occup@@ ants and their neighbours , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working area , which today compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in the last few years has become increasingly mag@@ nets for tourists and suff@@ er@@ ers from all over the world : with them , residents of G@@ DR @-@ era and former occup@@ ants share their Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development .
no other road was mentioned this year as often with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most important part of the off@@ ences make tangible damages , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94 , uncertainty cannot be answered by uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is wei@@ ght@@ less : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , who are not supposed to be . &quot;
&quot; the famous burning cars , too , give it no longer in Riga . &quot;
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal background , on the contrary : &quot; here it helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer moved to Riga &apos;s street - and stayed .
&quot; this is why it was also so important that the residents of the local population had to return to their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : through fac@@ eless re@@ constructions in former buildings that are forced to impose the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; that is , in the end , con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not be thei@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if someone h@@ ears someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides of fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub district , compla@@ ining about noise . &quot;

a serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for connecting flights that have been recognized .
municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must under@@ mine the refugees in their own or rented homes .
&quot; the costs for building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the council office to municipality and Job@@ centre .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; in fact , the administration does not find private homes . &quot;
&quot; so far , it does not work so far as to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
