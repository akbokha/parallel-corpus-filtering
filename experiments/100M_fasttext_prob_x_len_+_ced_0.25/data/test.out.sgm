<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means me very much," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sports successes but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away."</seg>

<seg id="14">"she is an executive director of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid in Bavaria, and deals with women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">"they live in the Munich North, one of the few decentralised accommodations for all-immigrated women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe."</seg>

<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say," "Every woman who counts here has made experiences with sexual violence," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because they are persecuted because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as a hope for Europe," she tells. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons for the escape:" many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"Russia and Turkey: an" "Alliance of outsiders" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight months of the war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in the reception, I cannot be denied the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed to be silly, and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even to improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have been so benign than would never have happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was waved.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it was even bigger, since it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"it is difficult to rebuild the Vetroen again, if not impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the serious side, accusations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family would benefit from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemence.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan, first of all, needs all the friends he can get after he has been in a failed coup d'état in a failed coup d'état."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry at the West, since its reaction to the tried power takeover is considered a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the ongoing resentment on the tick-empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike on it is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian state of State gained a bonus that he called for the attempted coup d'état support for the elected state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regimitation."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an" "Alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that face the West and feel badly treated and now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both President Obama said on the press conference that they would not even have stripped the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey avoided a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state are talking to each other again."</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was a part of Putin's closest friend of trust.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a statement of the Kremlin, it is that Putin has ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who was deputy for 2012 Ivanovs, was appointed to his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 1972, in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is called (in Russian) that he later became protocol Chief and Chief of Staff of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on his appointment, he said to Putin:" thank you for your confidence. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow a mysterious city.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was one of the closest trusts Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff retires."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">That doesn't know anybody.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that a man who once had been praised as a potential president once had to lead the Russian environmental policy - met on great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," It is true that I asked you in a conversation with me at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say - you could almost say - complained for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB state security service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">"by May 2017, the £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017"</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "deck blower", "which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 chilled cables."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"today, Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown took a visit to the site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with over 30.000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fitting."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a beta for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge at its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the closure of future-oriented high-end and civil engineering presents."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last street covering and its connection with the north tower deck, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern tip bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very hot.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up at an incline of about 3%."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's olympiamship in the Turnen and that from more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second: this team has three turner, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, which inspires many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly raisman, the Jewish is and Madison Kocian, the Catholic is, turns out, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has consolidated the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one was one of the female leaders of an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">"last year Simone and Gabby # 1, # 2."</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the last Olympic games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiagewinnerin and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they were unexpected but masterful gymasticroutines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-competition event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we are experiencing the peak of this sport, but we do not see turnaround in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympics will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that Turnen is a more expensive sport and gymnasts primarily in private gym clubs, which are maintained by parents, who are responsible for training, training, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gyms are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their whole training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started with the turf."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to aun the communities out of countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, enable a more affordable and easy-to-access gym training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers (mainly black and hispanic) and training national and international winner."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer young high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">"this combination offers life-long benefits for health, as well as for school and professional success."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is the inspiration of this team, who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the game and that's great."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "by the Holes of Olympic Team golds and thank you, you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to begin their journey, healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is wisely ignored as a non-ending government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles acts verbally the police, election observers and Rathenhouses to have ignored evidence of voter abuse due to" hypersensitivities in relation to ethno and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Communal Government, which is now a Antarctic King, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off off-off tapes out of ballot boxes to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should take a proof of their identity in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the time, a voter must only name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report suggests that non-removable ink can be applied to the finger of a person, if they release their constituents to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only for election fraud, but also the municipal government in front of the wider Corruption and Financial Fraud Culture, which is associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet Wahlskandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special election court decided that the official mayor Luton Rahman was supposed to become corrupted and illegal practices of his office."</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way and that he would have brought his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to be" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation, when someone chooses someone else."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed particularly alarming to the fraudulent correspondence between the older members of Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leadership of evidence to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report, it is stated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people, in accordance with the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or Muslim background."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "there were concerns that... State institutions such as" politically correct "have been ignoring such behaviour because of" political correctness "of ethics and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban that political activists may process letters of letters to stop" "electoral". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is drawn by Theresa May, demands tougher registration tests to prevent the electoral register of immigration and social security purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Options in consideration to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">"do not use removable ink on the finger of a person, as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic review of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications to an automatic stamp.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition of political activists to process full letteries and envelopes of letters.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to establish shut-off for election stations.</seg>

<seg id="31">Photo-ban in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Request that only English can be used in the election stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters go alone into the election cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet case no criminal complaint was put.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a Litanei to corrupt and illegal practices," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, it was found guilty of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal procedure."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "defense controls" "of the election registration divisions of the Rathenhouses."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country, as the mother of parliaments a proud heritage, but the worrying and widespread spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">The buyers did not know where to see when a woman moved her clothes in the midst of a Primark to try underpants.</seg>
<seg id="3">"in order to make the situation worse, she muted as she saw it, she pulled out and laid her back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="4">"she continued and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, on."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Primark Business in the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone where the woman tried the underpants before she put her back into the shelf</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in the store, said that after the mysterious woman had tasted the underwear, she returned and left the shop without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">"she said," "The people could not believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the middle of the sales floor, they took a pair of underpants, pulled out their own tights and pants and tried them."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she did not even try to find a more discrete place to do it - she was simply there, frech like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"everyone stared when she pulled back the underpants, which you obviously didn't like, as she put them back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">"she repeated the same with three further underpants, before she finally decided that she had nothing to go up and out."</seg>
<seg id="12">She didn't seem to disturb her that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who would buy the underpants she had tried.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said:" "as opposed to thinking that someone would take underpants down home that had a different person and that were not washed."</seg>

<seg id="15">"Ms. Davidson added:" "as I have received, the employees have tried to draw clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good as it was."</seg>
<seg id="16">I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants to go home and find out that another woman had her and went out and didn't get washed.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit more secure.</seg>
<seg id="3">"we spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to walk along with armed robbers."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind, this video will show you how you rotate the spear for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approaching from behind, then you should turn off as first so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the line, "Mizrachi says."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then beat him with the knee in the womb and turn, while the attacker bowed down from pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while she aligns the weapon."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line, grab the weapon and turn it so that the attacker can't shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, store the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip, before moving backwards and set the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi prefers.</seg>

<seg id="2">"a British traveler underwent his immune system and throats of serious scrutiny, taking some of the dirtiest and most disgusted places of Europe."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shabed his course on a euro note, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a purge of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of the ticks of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and show us what he is going to be."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the idea of removing the purge button of a lift-toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen rinse."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he rejected, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by traveling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railroads to railway stations, to dishwashers of toilets, the task placed its immune system definitively under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the movie, he told:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test cut showed a Luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared with this, the luminescence number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to cut off after their luminescence count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom"</seg>

<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found ownership in an irreparable state."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer needed."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people do not have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider because this property is presumably considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is too.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fighting with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, disputes and floods."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received an order for antisocial behaviour in June."</seg>

<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner this week forcibly by the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the delogation was cheered by lightened neighbors, saying that their lives were made to hell."</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They don't care about anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police are incredible.</seg>

<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family would have to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police were called in regular intervals, 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown page of the church, rubbish and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenants tend to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family as a delogation is always the last step, the Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be awful with their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have been courageous to us and have provided us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will be donated to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="37">"after they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>

<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall shared that the delogation is a clear warning to the other tenants that don't stick to the house rules.</seg>

<seg id="9">"it is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men in mid-ages love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before joining the comment section, to oversow him under the pseudonym non-Allegra male mediator, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the diverse re-emergence of sound boards is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="8">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit before I stand, hold my hands and say something better than:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho stands slowly in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were resident - there's still a handful of fantastic record specialist stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data of data: two young women, three men of middle age) into Reckless Records (data of data: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I wonder?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have approx. 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy and buy items he sold when he was young and plundered."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70 who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I probably was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy boards, rather introverted and willing to spend time alone, adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media, people who have heard about the comeback, and prompted to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people usually have to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to bail of the record label of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world, and would like to draw back to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that call for happy youth memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is as a collector so I think it is so in many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee flutes a stack of sheet piles."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month, have not yet listened to."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at that time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I pee through a pile of Bossa Nova Comppilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men of middle age) has noticed a" "trophy aspect" "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came just recently and said:" "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead soundboard so that I can put them into the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-less, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, which are only slowly being reinstated."</seg>
<seg id="44">"after all, there is a blower audience than I'm going to do."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and women of middle age."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the pre-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizers and sexually-packed pop instead of experimental jazz, it's good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"no one of them looks strange, but nagging psychological traumas are hard to imagine when you stand beside someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She makes a window shopping rather than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she does not deserve much, therefore collecting plates does not make any real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It cost much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." she drives with a dearest sighs. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how I should explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression to mutate the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"the left is a staircase, a wall filled with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some as far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but in view that every attraction for these items might mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury goods such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the boomerang through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the staring view of an insidious, 30-year false presenter, who stands on the shoulders of nothing."</seg>

<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature."</seg>

<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government heads under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their prescriptions, an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>

<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats gave no indication of an intervention of the White House in the Centcom analysts with regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported from investigations by the Pentagon's chief inspector, who were recorded by Centcom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press spokesperson on the Pentagon, gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the Congress, while the investigations were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is meanwhile made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the allegations of the past year have raised the question how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State is remembering interdependencies of more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, dealt with the recommendations of many analysts, just a small occupation force in Iraq and took little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker, according to government officials, that contrary to the statements of the government, the government of the government had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group because these provisional refineries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, the Olympic Games are."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistent and inevitable, a rapid relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is handed down from the wristwatch to the gymnasts for the triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't switch to TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the coffeshop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who was for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's Black w with dimples, would certainly have been among these well-known names that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even a flaw."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame doesn't illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the sports which are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breastfeeding swimming and may rule it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make modest arguments for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney for the last 16 years, it was so sparsely noticed that many of whom I had interviewed did not know that it was an Olympic Port."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping until 2012, and until 2012, an athlete had managed to reach the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outdoor character, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear to be suitable for a clowjob school than those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonous quotes of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of the gym and diving, the two sports that are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"the winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to take a number of falling moves (turning, real and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic program, you will be evaluated according to the official Olympic program, degree of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists in their pursuit of gold have to go further, faster, upward and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and back, upwards and downwards on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only chase the finish line or the starting wall, but also in the television transmission also another highlight: the World or the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir up a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel at watching these games as a little tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an Atempause.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prallates, seemingly heavenly as an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly up again."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's so Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the ends as part of an afternoon on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of Olympia's manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably be overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the object identification of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts, according to The Wall Street Journal recently proposed - then Mr. Dooley awaits its air channel, new fan community."</seg>

<seg id="7">"but during the last few months, protests against the government were shaken by the country and expanded into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people crashed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>

<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN authority for human rights is calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorism across the region, particularly in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded its considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"gb2312 (Chinese, simplified) gb18030 (Chinese, simplified)"</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and these don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all of the land use up to the extinction of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this delicate, controversial line called hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts feared that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were more or less forced in the last years, were able to exploit the turbulence and could be armed."</seg>
<seg id="29">"several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of bitterness, under the surface, explode."</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?"</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide wherever they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Validateerrorpages VerboseOutput Clean up Markup with HTML-Tidy Help on the options is available. congratulations</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly come to Christian lands, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and live in flat landscape areas."</seg>

<seg id="40">Validateerrorpages VerboseOutput Clean up Markup with HTML-Tidy Help on the options is available. congratulations</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was sentenced to death on an unpublished illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that it was particularly enslaved in using early signs of dissatisfaction and use special officers to handle opponents, and make them harmless."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unpredictable reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time, Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections protested by the government, which were reported by analysts by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if less than in the last months, and that time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">"but obviously, this does not prevent the intensification of the internal demise of the Ethiopian government."</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, a Muslim city, attacked by Tigray, and hatred towards the tigray is becoming increasingly more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests in the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights across the neighboring Somalia, even if it was recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin crest hike."</seg>

<seg id="3">"this clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensible with the American public."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July, he drew up strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack to Mrs. Clinton's Emails, but he later said," "Of course I thought the sarcastically." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>

<seg id="17">"but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an etext of its tone, as his demand has gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday showed a leading lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or understand his humour wrong."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is intensified in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal comrades into the inconvenient situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent intercessors, gave himself great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was interviewed about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled out the troops out of Iraq."</seg>

<seg id="21">"it was the American who sent food to starving Europeans during the first World War." "A Square Meal" "draws the way that the country was going to change to be no longer the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when the food for the Americans was a central, tense topic," Coe committed, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as tense was the new budget diver: mysterious dishes such as breads and casserole were too staple, the casserole as a" "wonderful way to rethink food leftovers", "noted Ziegelman as quiche could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Seldom have I been so pleased with a software purchase.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hay usually only occur in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an investigation on the ship of the Sanna research ship, this Hai was able to return to the sea after an investigation."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is swimming with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland hay has only got up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the Greenland-shark swims along the Nordatlantiks, in an hour he is on average just 1.220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-metre long animal accelerates on Satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, this loneliness of loneliness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science, "at least from a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion, wishes and suggestions. we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey. online Survey Information for survey participants"</seg>
<seg id="12">"in fact, the evolutionary biologist probably assumed that Greenland hay became a stone age."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland hay is hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers correspondingly little about the lifestyle of the Greenland hay.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time-pentempo to them, when they presented six animals with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cadaver, which torpedoes from higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the biggest 502 cm measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens core of shark with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons search for large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"with 220 centimeters length of the third tier, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland hay had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the Kohlenstoff-14-o showed a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimetres might even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign the length of age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold for the sexual maturity and its age was determined for 156 years, Greenland hay has obviously been at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"it is not a coincidence that such methuseles live primarily in icy waters, but it is not a coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, an 211-year old Grönlandwal, was trapped in his bacon at the neck of a 120-year old harpoon tip, was captured before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals live on savings of flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly big."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal slows heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of the mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should rather invest his resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabited."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have once created similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erased atmosphere and still turned away slowly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminates the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet presumably pointed out more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected against faster evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its daily side of the sun almost two months," "said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which is like an umbrella to shield the surface of much of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result is average temperatures, some degree cooler than the Earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model brought forth a history of Venus, which resembles evolution that has previously been suspected of planet explorers."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the course of several billion years, Venus was exposed too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen escaped, there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="24">"one reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the most important part of the offences make tangible damages, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94, uncertainty cannot be answered by uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is weightless: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who are not supposed to be."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the famous burning cars, too, give it no longer in Riga."</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal background, on the contrary:" here it helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer moved to Riga's street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"this is why it was also so important that the residents of the local population had to return to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: through faceless reconstructions in former buildings that are forced to impose the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"that is, in the end, condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction can I absolutely not be theirs." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone hears someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides of frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">"who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub district, complaining about noise."</seg>
