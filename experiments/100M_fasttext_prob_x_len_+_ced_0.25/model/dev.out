Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just a friendly way .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as on Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , but a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , who shot his girlfriend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told a somewhat angry voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officers found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was confirmed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lam@@ b . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who lived in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already submitted 300 miles to the school site where he shot and killed a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tk@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lam@@ b has made the fatal emergency call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ b took the life when the police interven@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , students and lect@@ urers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what lamb motiv@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the details of the investig@@ ators published on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy with their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; he himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in one of his written book , in which he shared the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both subordin@@ ated in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members comprised 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problem@@ ati@@ cal behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lam@@ b praised , said , &quot; &quot; he seemed too excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that Lam@@ m had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; at first , Lam@@ b had asked the Delta State University to have an assessment of health reasons and said that he had any health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lam@@ b had worked so hard for him , would no guarantee for an automatic route to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said , he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
these are questions that can no longer answer the Lam@@ b .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs &apos;s trace when he entered into Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as again . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the rear yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was running in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said she knew that he knew people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lam@@ b began his work at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and taught geography and education . &quot;
he was a doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the many years of Friend@@ ship Lam@@ b called him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 , when she met with common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried to teach her guitar playing . &quot;
he was the wom@@ b at that time .
&quot; all girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lam@@ b &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which borders on a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lam@@ b , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail presented both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or another gig together .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes , sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the rooms and j@@ oked each other .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of sh@@ ear . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his brother and student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening , including lect@@ urers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;

&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lam@@ b had shot the emergency call after he was shot , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss called his wife , but there is no indication that the two were ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us is planning to hire fewer workers for Christmas time

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ Moon says his answer to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will make violence and misery for millions of people just worse . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief calls again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and implement inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ tt@@ ed that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in order to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity that they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .

some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have done it as a joke .
and some waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys conducted Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claimed that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given leadership to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , of which no one has won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing tr@@ umps of stam@@ ina and begin to drop their dollars to overthrow him . &quot;
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump started his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
some three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week noted that 60 per cent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in a survey by CNN / ORC last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would either be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he would be the candidate .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
the next in stuff enthusiasm ?
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be candidate . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bomb@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of the Irish voters , that the real estate Mog@@ ul have the right tem@@ per for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality of a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively conduct his office , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament does not pas@@ se in the White House , as ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; if they set up their dish@@ on@@ est hats , republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; this is the first time I &apos;ve ever seen , but I think it &apos;s a good thing to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a change since the time when four from ten end of July have put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump beats almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ ump leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally Paul , John Ka@@ uns and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have for@@ given their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the opinion . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; was the immigration revol@@ ving and fishing point in the public discourse about 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bomb@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump critical His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republican Party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration will remain in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s up new heights .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the support of Republican voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ strated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens believe , &quot; &quot; said the Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ str√∂m in the presentation . &quot;
the Swe@@ din is propos@@ ing to introduce the proposal as a European negotiation position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; through TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is expected to grow by 800 million people . &quot;
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are specifically indicated that the EU states and the US will select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to the same parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ g@@ ments .

&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tribun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , to ride damage to the tax pay@@ ers , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first opinions , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act as well as the proposals of the European Commission are inadequate . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it has been critic@@ ised for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; the German economic state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a big step . &quot;
&quot; the Commission included key points , the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tribun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Mal@@ m@@ str√∂m .
the European business association business Europe warned that the possibilities of the economy can be limited by too many new rules .

&quot; when discussions on TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) have been concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s frac@@ tures
&quot; since its election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected to anticip@@ ate the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings with excitement . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ ings and put himself on the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up to ask the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , and his performance from the media is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony at a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several titles @-@ pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention . &quot;
&quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ns , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party was originally supported as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the political correspondent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour , &quot; and to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements to the European Union and the limiting in profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 ¬£ to 23@@ ,000 ¬£ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory Chief , over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has given &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 ideas . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings has become a fron@@ tier , and that he will focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow of Economic Minister , will represent him if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is on the road abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into a conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesman of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s fac@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; since they first broadcast on television first in 1990 , the question@@ naire was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important barometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came through the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the arbit@@ rators , whereby Har@@ rison shou@@ ted , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Cy@@ ren@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a Kra@@ mp@@ f , a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; a matter of which I &apos;m quite wis@@ er , is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn up a little in the dispute , He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a var@@ ic@@ ose in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he really beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I believe he was a little too severe . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os in the important decision , which begins on Friday and describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . &quot;

&quot; Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and ri@@ ps the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted with indig@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and settled down there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter over them , the migrants &apos; andi@@ zed migrants &apos; open the border ! &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian deploy@@ ments police . &quot;
some pointed out foods and water from protest foods and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc with a str@@ it@@ ous meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; but Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a bal@@ ing action from Brussels or from his neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency rose in two southern regions on Tuesday was given more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is also planning to build a barb@@ ed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison ins@@ ults in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees that have the right to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 metre ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ uns , who built the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es the emergency state , &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ tern in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains ground . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is about what candidate will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more stable in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a great lead in women and temper@@ ate , but these origins have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a great lead with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit lead in Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; for example , half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections would say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party . &quot;

Clinton &apos;s supporters will also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .

&quot; since the vice @-@ president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the Wa@@ ag@@ mire , 57 per cent of the democratic voters will see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to fight for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton won a lead ahead of S@@ anders , 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the constitu@@ tion@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; similarly , in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er vote as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results with some important characteristics in choosing the election of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider things to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best from hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the democratic voters of the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; there are questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as a foreign minister , most of the Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it does not affect their opinions . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .

&quot; the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;

five members of Brotherhood with the death of Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police reported . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
¬© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 when Den@@ g was power@@ less , and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gling his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Brotherhood to take advice , said Poli@@ tk@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the U@@ ten@@ sils began to hide and created the well @-@ being of Bru@@ der@@ schaft by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ tk@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; according to an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly added strength injuries to head , hull and th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the ic@@ anen of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the Sch@@ ik@@ anen since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; fr@@ at@@ ernity and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury from Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the third gra@@ der for the first five members .
&quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of illegal attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - we will also draw them into account , &quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a net increase is coming , and the house @-@ se will get into the wa@@ vering , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance for the business . &quot;
a recession occurred within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor of how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed that investors should not concentrate when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could see that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a net interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; contrary to this , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to be afraid . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , interest increases can be vol@@ atile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets will be boo@@ sted 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may be reflected again in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study on what happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ded later in the recovery cycle , and the return starts to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases they often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not have been before and who could accelerate the recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in a net interest rate of the F@@ ed .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .

&quot; interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of whether this time is different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have taken the whole year to a net interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all the eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the cy@@ c@@ lical cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ arks very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;

&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; in case of bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the recovery cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer together between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a fl@@ atter of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed income analyst at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;

BBC Director General rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to public music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , that I will learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;

&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 Bet@@ ty , who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central Bank of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , was under@@ lining the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Great Mos@@ que with his parents before the beginning of the annual meeting in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ man to Mec@@ ca with thousands , which will continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden group would not have to steal the arm of the sick as he was not used . &quot;
&quot; a Arab version of decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is forbidden . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man led to reveal what caused the fall of the sick , which crashed into an inner courtyard of the Grand @-@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place in this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has no statements about the collapse of the cranes , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bapti@@ zed the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
&quot; dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project , which is run by the bin Laden group . &quot;
&quot; for decades , the Bin Laden family has been connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and takes over larger construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was dischar@@ ged from the family in 1990 . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the sick came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom of pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of a every healthy Muslim . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .

&quot; at the regional court Kl@@ agen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball team A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and issu@@ ing training . &quot;
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of minist@@ erial bre@@ wing .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel &apos;s Attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants had been cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation , that the def@@ endants were allowed to disp@@ ose of club accounts by which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;

the sports facilities are also indic@@ ted because of financial obligations .
&quot; this fact divided the chair of the Sch@@ √∂ff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; for the failure of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence felt that the association was not an asset in any time . &quot;

&quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the accused , in the bread profession , was a large @-@ scale audi@@ tor of the financial centre . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have proposed money to put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed upon : you can manage the money , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of financial success , the down@@ payment of allow@@ ances had been retro@@ active until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the allow@@ ances is only years later , namely , since 2003 when a plus has been paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the two accused , one of the two accused , said the second accused . &quot;

&quot; the association has not been interested in the details of financial matters , it is important to have been the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;

&quot; the def@@ endants were arrested , the def@@ endants declared . &quot;
&quot; on the name of the second accused , this securities account was not known according to the association &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happened , nobody would have known anything about this money , put the prosec@@ utor in the room . &quot;
the co @-@ accused was informed of the function@@ ary .
&quot; this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; &quot; claims &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the first def@@ endant declared that he had not been agreed with this form@@ ulation , because the association never had any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;

the Hungarian police were deployed at the Serbian border with R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as and Hydro@@ power against several hundred imposed refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspondent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k experienced the break of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; there was a police line behind it and behind the police , a water @-@ designer was prepared . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
&quot; at first , the officials initially used pepper spray . &quot;
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
&quot; in this way , the group was dissolved . &quot;
the refugees have now been waiting for a wait .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had breath@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot;

the press room of the Serbian police also suffered injuries caused by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; the world is watching when the US bank@@ notes on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade , interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a bit longer and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since F@@ ed interest paid to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank is likely to leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ dder , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ cking outlook of global relations . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision shall be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday .

&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleague and killed , Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; make it un@@ condi@@ tionally &quot; &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lam@@ b , lect@@ urer for geography and social sciences at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , he shot on someone and killed someone . &quot;
&quot; according to the staff of the emergency call centre , Lam@@ b said that police officers must send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but &quot; no one will distur@@ b anyone , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the attack@@ er to his name , but he didn &apos;t have him . &quot;
there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police took the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lam@@ b , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note Lam@@ b travelled 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing him before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said , he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in spite of reports on Monday , the Lam@@ b said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt said authorities on Tuesday to give &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss processed online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lam@@ b for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; Lam@@ b sent relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he did not go to jail . &quot;
&quot; as a polic@@ eman on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lam@@ b drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play monthly for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this led to the left @-@ wing def@@ enders to we@@ ep and exclu@@ de him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H√©@@ ctor Mor@@ eno during the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field of playing and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very hard and then fantastic plays and then it happens . &quot;

&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;

you can judge yourself if I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack on both legs .

&quot; if a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very bad violation , it is not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;

&quot; it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost out . &quot;
it is because you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; as he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 , the eco @-@ label of Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , as it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed before . &quot;
&quot; all beautiful and well , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is alleged the action of the book , instead of giving an overview of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the pretty short origin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the Moor@@ ish city of Th@@ itz @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , is hoping to see the girl of his dreams by reading her desire to see a real tree . &quot;
&quot; a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is there to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the story of the book so little . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment with the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fied , Th@@ ought stri@@ ck@@ ling Once @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the well @-@ known Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , schn@@ ur@@ r@@ ushed essence , &quot; which is called &quot; the name of the trees &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has read The Lor@@ ax not 20 times in a row of a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Cameron &apos;s employees was delivered , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the Ka@@ der , England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks &apos;s page is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as Spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in this case , Adam Ly@@ th is divor@@ ced from the England test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ te , of course , is for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this - players are their best performers . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one had extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully suggests further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will be . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not get so good performances , and that didn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can elev@@ ate was that England first set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - but this lost opportunity lies in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a drummer , whom I am highly valued . &quot;
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends on course of the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , bringing an extra spin bow@@ ler and four Qui@@ cks would get , and I don &apos;t have anything against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious player of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire has perhaps not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire but he is a number 3 for her and there is no big difference .
my previous team mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred laps right away and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him , he was very impressed with him as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his stats - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders that lift their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and how Mah@@ ela has insights from which we can profit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind to the changing cabin , even if the news is in line with the previously spoken . &quot;
&quot; the team colleague at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team manufacturers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
&quot; and you must remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results . &quot;
such decisions are not made easy .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ riv@@ alled new strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper into difficulties with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was severely beaten by Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ a friend said that some member states , so deeply dist@@ ressed in various crises , like the EU it is now and not always of its own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disturbing contrac@@ tual changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , TU@@ C decided on its annual general meeting , that it may not like to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot;
we could also name Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wants an outside Great Britain inside the EU @-@ tent - &quot; L@@ ass not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her as it looks bad for her as it seems to be bad for her as it seems to be bad for her like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s Fran√ßois Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or its implementation in 2017 .
it is also an end @-@ to @-@ end force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nationalist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they are going to pull out a leg to help the Sel@@ fie British , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scottish exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally plan un@@ inten@@ tional comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ trial was a &quot; &quot; P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain did not win anything from the re @-@ plot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as did it during the refer@@ end@@ ums in 1975 , but were not supported by our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who have made a name as a &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Straight Ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; correspondent in the early 90 years . &quot;
&quot; in all his dec@@ eit@@ fulness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone exchanges foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ in@@ countries , most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair thought about them , but realized that if you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you can get better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , as Blair had set the principle about the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened him a back@@ door . &quot;

&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly Kl@@ aps on Monday in West@@ minster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time for me - seems at risk , Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck Bo@@ yk@@ ott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s years , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I think it is friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ylene tendency and the wild plu@@ mage of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism , everyone can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs in him were fighting not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provoc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be on television because his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without losing too far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties to all reports on the assembly evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bot@@ tom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and before all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity to EU membership - in accordance with its Benn@@ ite siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - will be obliged to find foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mis@@ sive voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if it can be anything useless ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I named British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze the report of Public Health UK via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; the claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E cigarettes were less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded by critici@@ zing the evidence of public health UK ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e cigarettes used by public health UK ( PH@@ E ) .
PH@@ E published the &quot; Fundam@@ entals Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have asked the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; in the last month , a editorial published in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month handles the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily intense basis &quot; on which PH@@ E started its most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; on stone or sand &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to create a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) to create their opinions on the damage caused by various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also wrote the BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champions , of which some also provide sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line of PH@@ E also took part . &quot;

&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that the BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear evidence of current evidence that E cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs , which are not broadcast by other UK channels . &quot;
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC that they will be seen publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and by transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried to contact the BBC for six years with channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly presented by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the senior management committee in his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think about a good idea in a medium term or long term , it should at least apply to programs that others do not do or on behalf . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a broad support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programme is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm to it . &quot;
I have to see how this is to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would l@@ essen the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that BBC blame on the hunt for reviews &quot; because the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show that the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they do not meet their tasks , and they can argue if they have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody saw . &quot;
they put them into a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; on the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , remember all that you get a great value for 150 ¬£ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 ¬£ a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s true because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission , to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should be an example of the public television broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;

HZ@@ I researchers discover control centres in Y@@ ers@@ inia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction at the moment when they have sound impul@@ ses , which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard . &quot;
impul@@ ses work by switching to Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically altered to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : read researchers and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found it out , rein@@ force the ultrasound waves that penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the increased ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels , and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when it uses ultr@@ asonic to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bub@@ bles and transfer into the worms , where they are switched to the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be revealed in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound @-@ waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student resi@@ dences

most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry in student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly annoying up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to smile : people tell where you come from where you come to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you don &apos;t hate Mar@@ m@@ ite , because in the seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;

and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it &apos;s the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were fired and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in this case , do not think of catching up with a relationship with a relationship . &quot;
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you have to go away so that I receive the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead .

what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the massive accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms does not have any sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need sufficient space for the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey ter@@ raced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs the least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different when people are under@@ min@@ ed in residential blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for each four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it is peace , I go back . &quot;

&quot; one of the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed according to the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to be waiting for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
&quot; on the premises of the gas station , there were also three people . &quot;
&quot; one of these men cried now to the young people , and struck them with the fist . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also high on our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel with this .
&quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum application will also be &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we don &apos;t accept bound@@ less migration flows , not over the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and under circumstances also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the Minister of Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Stav@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an external limit in the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to avoid its borders for refugees but not to be abri@@ dged . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill his obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik ever met police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including many women and children . &quot;
the Red Cross has also been used for rescue services and the Red Cross .

&quot; in addition , buses from the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , had been re@@ directed towards Croatia , and reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it is the way people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Ser@@ b border town Si@@ d arrived , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were the whole night from the Maced@@ onian border around the Maced@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made it , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it could indeed come to a slightly further west @-@ western part of the previous Balkan route to Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary . &quot;

&quot; on her most expected meeting in the years Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spending two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ og@@ any table , to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the Leit@@ z for the first time . &quot;
&quot; im@@ pending on them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey sitting hall is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here .
&quot; but since the great recession , F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ even third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that they grow solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could be fri@@ ghtened to rein@@ force this vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is also only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market had enough justification to continue , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led by itself the financial market . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently interviewed by Bloom@@ berg have predicted this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets are waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this suggests a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ist wins the blow by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Dow Jones Industrial Average weigh@@ ed 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;

&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do , &quot; &quot; they would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they wouldn &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would be the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed is acting .
&quot; before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints of Liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , improvement was solid in the labour market this year . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ ald , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world were sent to the end of the last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell in May by more than 16 % below its top level , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would increase global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat in this month , the Dow is now around 10 % below the Ho@@ ch of May . &quot;

&quot; if the events on financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the past few weeks would not occur , &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot;
now he pre@@ suppos@@ es that they will wait for at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere suggestion of the former Lei@@ derer Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; close their monetary expansion &quot; , &quot; confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements , apparently not associated with the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
&quot; in 1998 / 1999 , Lack@@ er , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is a member of the Federal Open Market Committee for interest in interest in the years 1998 / 1999 . &quot;

&quot; the most recent turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of interest in interest because markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should pre@@ ach the time . &quot;

Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation Spr@@ S tries to clarify how important good diet is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of babies born on breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by around 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adjustment of the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system neg@@ atively . &quot;

&quot; at the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ bearing first and roof over@@ stand &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof pitch , which for energetic reasons - unlike in the building plan - is supposed to lie below 10 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan of the roof pitch does not permit &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ ri@@ eder Municip@@ ality generally more restri@@ ctive for exemp@@ tion contracts . &quot;
&quot; this is not a recur@@ ring project , but it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym hall construction at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the expense of EUR 2.3 million , approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;

&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable apartments , up to 2020 each year would have to be built around 400@@ ,000 new units . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the country has reinforced its border controls . &quot;
&quot; according to government information , the 20,000 migrants were still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the command of German authorities in the morning .

&quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday , when ten people were at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for Germany on Sunday , but because of the influ@@ x of refugees in Austria , it was surprising to them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help , and with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we left the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels , the str@@ anded train passengers had climbed into a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au , after the short notice that railway traffic was stopped after Germany , but still on the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was put off at the Inn at the border of W@@ ern@@ stein on the Inn . &quot;

&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n sends other tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than in the camp R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke immediately to help the establishment of structures that guarantee Human@@ ity , our Federal Chancellor has officially adopted the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
Lei@@ d@@ bearing of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions now in the border regions .
&quot; the refugees will also find that the &quot; &quot; gel@@ ob@@ ed country &quot; &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , faced with the ongoing refugee influ@@ x and the approaching winter , in order to establish decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pf@@ √§l@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came out of a place , whose inhabitants are called don@@ ors . &quot;
this property connects people with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; if he expresses himself hostile , journalists are concerned or knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office will boost the election campaign . &quot;
and cuts well .
&quot; this will also be registered in the P@@ √§l@@ z@@ an K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
&quot; the New Yorker , with the fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter , is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf near the wine road . &quot;
some of the 1200 inhabitants of the 1200 inhabitants are related to him .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous jumps , to which alongside Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for hum@@ ility , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; to the King of the Heart , he did not have it there . &quot;
&quot; as a result , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there is no doubt that the &quot; &quot; Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - too high German - the en@@ coder , says she . &quot;
¬© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold gra@@ ves in the United States .

&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home , failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pfalz had belonged . &quot;
&quot; he did not receive Tr@@ ump because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute of P@@ √§l@@ z@@ ische Geschichte and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes prominent statements of the desc@@ endant .
it was repeated repeatedly over Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ arized , it is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so angry . &quot;
do you believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sions@@ wir@@ tin Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family ended with a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine the Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it is better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the seeds at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like he would , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously wasn &apos;t just a game - I &apos;m going to stop him , &quot; she said . &quot;

but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .

&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers sports reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game . &quot;

4 people killed when polic@@ emen are shooting rubber bul@@ bs on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police attacked rubber bul@@ lying in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief District Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of you threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police were used tear gas and then fired into the air before they hit the rubber compound . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ bs , of which it is known to kill , but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal as southern pla@@ ins , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ acc@@ i say that new provinces , which would be formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
&quot; there were protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want to have their own state . &quot;
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clas@@ hes since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature acceler@@ ates the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature voted for certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly obes@@ e people live longer with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial about the new study in J@@ AMA surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have been proven effective for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out for people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers used from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital , who have been gathered in a study for 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach swal@@ lowing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dissolved in 28 % in some cases . &quot;

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish the mort@@ ality in five years , so the conduc@@ tive researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.4 to 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study showed no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is located between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have accumulated their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders urged to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; despite the Dal@@ ai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; in order to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the problem of violence , and commented George B@@ ush@@ s &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know , his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low strong alcoholic and inf@@ ectious dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 are reported to report the poison control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children come more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency recording , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children deliberately drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , while some do do to im@@ press their friends or because of a sample of social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant only because of a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing oral water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are perf@@ ected .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es that are very appealing to children . &quot;
drop dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t have a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold given by an adult in law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who was treated outside Atlanta in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ung@@ ed her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency reception .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by alcohol and hit the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store suspended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; in addition , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death cases . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women following the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three pup@@ il of the fourth class in the state New York planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and burned them out of their room .
&quot; the police looked at the interrog@@ ated plan as a &quot; &quot; turn@@ out &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot;

it &apos;s almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .

why I &apos;ll be witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison gas . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day closer , I began to fear me . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may be able to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available as places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites of 12 to five .
those who will be selected will be watching it emotion@@ ally .
I cannot do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compla@@ ined about her .
&quot; they said that &quot; &quot; it would have been better form@@ ulating &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
&quot; and from this perspective , I will see him die . &quot;
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying of unnecessary death .

&quot; an attempt to impose a man of Per@@ th , the police , was un@@ successful when he was in sei@@ z@@ ure and sum@@ p@@ pling water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to go back to the shore . &quot;

Peter Moody claims that Ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
&quot; Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a Spy in his st@@ ables last year , and threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he focused on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt test in Li@@ dar@@ is he could not explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held himself back 18 months for es@@ pion@@ age allegations , and did not want it to be &quot; &quot; see as too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing to say , and I have been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything is coming out , &quot; &quot; Moody . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well tonight .
&quot; I would like to embrace raised head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more train@@ ers . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before , Moody announced the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stall . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moody to Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a fraud .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Cra@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ y , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should I think that it is personal ?
&quot; if the R@@ V@@ L has beha@@ ved , and perhaps people outside of coaches are responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation of Li@@ dar@@ i and the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching , he said he was able to throw his license through the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody , the best known by his preparation of the un@@ disputed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse &apos;s debates , which was carried out against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my associates has wander@@ ed mud on the leg . &quot;
it would have been so late last night .

it &apos;s a joke .

America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the review of two leading train@@ ers at his team will be confident , as it will be wor@@ rying that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ fights when they were 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our def@@ ective system or the techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and that has provided us the turn@@ around . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team .
it &apos;s funny how this season is coming up again at this time .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has the idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne talking about exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening , and how exciting her game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a shit . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and do not have any points of ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;
the storm team is free since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next morning .

&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) was divided into Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful T@@ ief was the runner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic in the last days of the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
fierce storms and thunder@@ storms are expected above all in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , even until Thursday morning , in the Black Forest , at the Schw√§@@ bische Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ march with B√∂@@ en from 60 to 90 hour kilometres . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , there will be no longer time to look at the sun . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the buses at the IAA show their new innovations .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals fell to this segment according to the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) in August . &quot;
this is also reflected in the IAA ( Public Days 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concepts and new top @-@ class and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented in this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra , which will be in the fall of the dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel manager Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; this means that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the biggest competitor of VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra offers a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hesse also offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , to which the first three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are also among them . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra will initially offer the Opel Astra only as a fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is also shown at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be next next to the Astra at the International Motor Show on new compact cars ?
Rall@@ y@@ cross 2015 : Peugeot Hansen tri@@ on@@ f@@ ano in Canada
&quot; at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as a fifth in a conventional and a acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade , he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan King wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model . &quot;
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti adap@@ ts to the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; the Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services . it employs roughly 36@@ 0,000 associates worldwide ( as per April 1 , 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
&quot; according to the manufacturer &apos;s specifications , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .

&quot; otherwise , a violation of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional complaints have often strengthened the rights of pen@@ al prisoners . &quot;
&quot; so they said only in April a prisoner of damage , because he was locked naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision from 2011 , the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a decent accommodation in a parallel incident in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the former wast@@ ewater treatment plant was located between 15 @-@ 21 hours in a similar cell as well as in the Karlsruhe case . &quot;
&quot; in the last few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the headlines in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; therefore , prisoners will always be included in 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising , even to pun@@ ish@@ ments it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justice Pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young people , 19 should fall away from 2016 . &quot;

what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior in Germany , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated resolution in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create that , and we can create that . &quot;
&quot; what is coming to Germany , the following overview gives you the following overview . &quot;
&quot; this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothetical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by ‚Ç¨ 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015 &quot;
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all in affordable homes : 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing are out of the rental cost , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;

&quot; both assumptions seem unrealistic : for example , the impact of a global shock is likely to vary from one region to another . in this issue on regional labour markets , Norbert Schanne employs novel methods in spatial econometrics to describe and forecast their development . &quot;
&quot; however , refugees in Germany did not systematically ask for their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the education company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Migration Resear@@ chers Dietrich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there has been a political shift according to the Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt : from the work ban for refugees to the recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers for up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the commercial duty of asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;

&quot; until now , there is no adequate supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fle@@ dged parents give their children into the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the root parents , it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate . &quot;
&quot; however , in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management manual is distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for example by providing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared without knowledge of German knowledge in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , as well as teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s case of the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state does not prohi@@ bit asylum seek@@ ers or commem@@ or@@ ates the study - the only exception was Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) . &quot;
enter multiple addresses separated by commas and / or different lines .
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or dul@@ c@@ imer , do not receive any benefits after the asylum seek@@ er law more if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter is not a b@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ici@@ ans . &quot;

&quot; this funding gap also needs to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get to B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ um@@ b the same rights as they have the churches , and continue to develop the existing state churches right to a new state religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is important to be the foundation of an Islamic welfare association , who care professional about the newcom@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand , duties are also duties . &quot;
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to clean up certain control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take preced@@ ence over religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern , religious conflicts could also be included in Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to escape such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here at times , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bavarian Broad@@ casting Corporation . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today as a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is urgent . &quot;
&quot; as a result of European decisions , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination organisation and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it is very slow , as the NSU murder series showed , in the police and authorities , the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what Mig@@ rant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long demanded , and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ist convention , must become reality in the next few years , if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says the President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ acities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls for all incoming orders at the registration of health tickets . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to play as many people with the limited catalog of services that the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , doctors will be able to create the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are worse than other patients than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ters need to be taken over , demands them . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be helped with more general medical start @-@ ups in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; under refugee camps , there is much more uncomfortable disability , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ education . &quot;
&quot; with some other cases of disease German doctors from their training , however , it is clear that Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attack or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and put them in the same way as possible . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Federal psych@@ otherap@@ ist chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; in particular , refugee children are particularly vulnerable to refugee children , declar@@ es Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study conducted by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among others , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breathing difficulties , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration , strong sho@@ el@@ iness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms chronic if early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psychological sick asylum seek@@ ers can present a request for a psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the processing usually lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , doctors who are not trained in the social offices or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ concep@@ tions , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening of the Parliament was ass@@ aul@@ ted by the claims of members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had put him off and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech that he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokesman of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones , which warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and if his rehabilitation continues to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his story , his participation in the next summer of the European Championship is certainly uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the big dis@@ grace in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then returned to his old momentum during the season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his ank@@ le , or with the injuries he had previously . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the danger of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 lig@@ ator games in the last five playing times .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injuries ratio during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come from injury , you have a prone period of time , a time when you strengthen your body and win fighting force , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will get a career from the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H√©@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will launch . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to treat a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; despite Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites , the F @-@ M Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ating effects in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has pulled the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and continues to lead the association with his first European cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked with Arsen@@ al yet .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;

Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Comedy Show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar portra@@ ys in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year stool . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably announced the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressive symptoms confirmed that when the suffering had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were double . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media , communication with its focus on substance is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but defined by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the football match in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of knowing that men can relate to any situation , even if they are often reluct@@ ant to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a member of the telephone pastoral care , I explained : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ confident , has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us , often don &apos;t feel able to speak with friends . &quot;
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one speaks about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so , my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone can also help people in moments of desper@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with a completely re@@ designed backdrop to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; if you look at Starbucks someone alone , give him a smile and tell him Hello . &quot;
you never know what kind of friendship could do .
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
&quot; di Maria arrives to help PS@@ G , mal@@ m@@ √∂ &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Mal@@ m@@ √∂ .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the track , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before she finally achieved her lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ ball@@ tor in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Masters , as it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O. rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or exit in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to create our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things we need to perfect throughout the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on its own place against Bor@@ deaux in the First League , but he was killed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine wing door was designated as the man who was taken over to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he was in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ √∂ defense , he concluded that he joined Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ √∂ , the Celtic in a play @-@ off in order to reach this stage , came up with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave itself up , with some mis@@ prints and bad connections , not least of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five attempts on the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; however , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who transformed the Di Maria into a shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pi@@ ste ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth seasonal factor after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flank of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ √∂ could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to low the end result before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognised at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Mal@@ m@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the Quali@@ fication games are not enough .
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety of film@@ making
Matt Dam@@ on faced the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with ins@@ ulting un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . &quot; okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian were captiv@@ ated . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown join Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to invite people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said at first . &quot;

&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Matter achieved nationwide action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against farmers . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince played a play on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; ( Albums still have their meaning ) . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Matter have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , if the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
&quot; professional sport climbing and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which closed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Kamer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last part , climbing at a 75 foot long climbing rope was included in 30 seconds . &quot;
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full of three seconds faster than the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of the winning of the Great prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 dollars or had to live , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first at the course , won &apos;t get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; when there is more than a fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changing life , he receives the great degree of gra@@ tification . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ears about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received numerous awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had lost the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended to an a@@ waited season which will start shooting in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak at Minnesota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; earlier , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
the Tw@@ ins spent a chance to climb up within a game half of Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return to the three letters F @-@ word which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , once again in the sixth and then again in ninth place . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three races .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to quit this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw every game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I will concentrate entirely on the game . &quot;
&quot; the design@@ ate Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits , and was in two races , his first lap since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has well s@@ lash@@ ed the wood , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , saw clearly better off the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back to the game again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who designed the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the final run , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
it was this season in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play

&quot; however , the right @-@ wing stand , however , is S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for its fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game from a not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ ans , who had been painted in front of the game from the injury list , after he was ste@@ aling more than one month due to a back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;ve wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I put off and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;

hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with glorious pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his very personal interpretations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year @-@ old - which is by no means equal to &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective themes are adapted , it may seem quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many themes of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles , which have emerged as cru@@ el@@ ty , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments , or fa@@ ther@@ less . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective bi@@ blical passages . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bi@@ blical passages from Ot@@ mar Alt , and so today , translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ ally mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible biography of Martin Luther , and each one of the artist , who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts to the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant mist@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; then the up@@ bringing happened with the pipe , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt recalls . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work this , in order to be able to forgive me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to restore art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked today by advertising , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is being pushed out .
artists have another desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer go into the images , and let them discover , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for itself . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like how he works with his pictures life . &quot;
&quot; I have not taken care of recording the Bible completely , but chosen for him important , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains merely . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler from the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;

&quot; as the theme is safe to play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can help and wants to help .
&quot; the decisive turn@@ out , however , must place policy . &quot;
&quot; the German football federation therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continued until 2019 , &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ sbach at the edge of the UE@@ FA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal lists support this program .
&quot; this weekend , the 36 professionals start a clear sign , if they are on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said Bayer CEO Rudi V√∂l@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football federal lists , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;

that all 36 license agreements have started in their own projects is great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent will live in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for a duck
&quot; it is a mixture of very big fashion shows and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich . &quot;
&quot; the highlights : display mannequins , which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts . &quot;
I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past , it was light , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th September to the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; For me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you get into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the scar@@ ce work of the man who has written a fashion story , without ever having an apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork for which a lot of effort was carried out : to recre@@ ate the dolls , an example was dedicated to a sty@@ list . &quot;

&quot; he stands for the first , tender @-@ fashioned way of designing the designer . &quot;

jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Plau@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ ders in and around Plau@@ en to make a meter . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , such as blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; today , this alone does no longer work , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ dest@@ it@@ ze Plau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , the fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Plau@@ ener tip , fashion played a greater role , then was pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewellery , with accessories such as bags and in regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , is an increasing order potential . &quot;

&quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories , which have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly variable to keep a customer base . &quot;

XI urges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy needs to open wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday to a group that was commissioned by the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should be able to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; new start @-@ ups to promote and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of policies , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the local tax system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created , sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments . &quot;
the system is tested and tested by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because the market has a major role in the allocation of resources , which guarantees a legal state of law and designed the market open , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the government will also make controls on the powers transferred to companies , and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer , open @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas for private investments will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;

EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and consumers have a significantly higher dose of neur@@ al@@ gia .
&quot; the consumer organization Food@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharply : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed with full force on pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system are to be raised for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dator @-@ fish are so heavily loaded with mer@@ cury , that , on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be dis@@ inf@@ ring@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU will want to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
