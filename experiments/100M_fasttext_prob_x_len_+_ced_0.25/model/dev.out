Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ sing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuing settlement construction of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of peace in the peace process .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress , which was classified as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken to Obama , but a meeting had rejected this with reference to the time im@@ pending election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , who shot his girlfriend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lam@@ b . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already had 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tk@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lam@@ b did the fatal emergency call at some point afterwards .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m accepted life when the police interven@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; one day after shooting in the university , students and lect@@ urers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lam@@ b motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the State , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both supported in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members comprised 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lam@@ b , seemed too excited and nervous , as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; at first , Lam@@ b had asked the Delta State University to ask for reasons for health reasons and said that he had any health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doctor@@ ate , for which Lam@@ b had worked so hard , would no guarantee for an automatic route to create an assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that can no longer be answered .
&quot; after fle@@ eing from the campus , police later found Lam@@ b &apos;s trail when he entered into Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; house on outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lam@@ b began his work at the University , with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and taught geography and education . &quot;
he has a doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the many long @-@ standing girl@@ friends called it as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 , when she met by common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy , who tried several years to teach her guitar play . &quot;
he was the saus@@ age at that time .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lam@@ b said , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that borders on a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lam@@ b , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail recorded both at a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or other gig together .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes , sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of September 5th for the last time , after Lam@@ b finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic aspi@@ ration . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were standing up and j@@ oked each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Fr . Allan Mitchell , a English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his brother and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lect@@ urers , staff , students and members of the church on a candle light commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ awake , while the university or &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be taken on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .

&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lam@@ b had shot the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lam@@ m called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;

&quot; UN chief says , there is no military solution in Syria &quot;
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief urges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to uni@@ fy and support integ@@ rative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the meeting of the Council of Ministers to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ tt@@ ed that the events in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ uble . &quot;
ban called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .

&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull out Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , of whom none of them won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ umps through@@ put , and begin to drop their dollars to drop it . &quot;

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
&quot; for example , three of ten say they have a negative opinion . &quot;
and these figures are in the early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week determined that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CNN / ORC last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would either be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; happy &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;

&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ ump Temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bomb@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul had the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ law , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively conduct his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters get acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; if they set up their dish@@ on@@ our@@ mets , republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if you are asked who is winning the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee , after a poll of CNN / ORC coming from last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of the ten end of July have put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were gathered for another candidate , Tr@@ ump proposes almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the scattered field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ ump &apos;s leadership , while the anti @-@ dr@@ ump support is spread to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ ap@@ ing the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .

six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump called in his election campaign two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; was the immigration of shooting and fishing in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bomb@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s crucial His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the republi@@ can party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post poll from Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration will remain in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s up new high@@ es .
&quot; in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son are eliminated about half of the support of Republican voters , above all by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;

and they are angry at Washington .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; stated the Commissioner of Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; through TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone will be created by 800 million people . &quot;
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are specifically targeting the EU states and the US together with independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come from the EU , the United States and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned for the first time . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ g@@ ments .

&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ral tribun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice which allows companies to pay damages to the tax@@ pay@@ ers , bro@@ aden national laws or cut down consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it was critic@@ ised that they are not to apply for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the premiere of the prime minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings has been anticip@@ ating for his election
the new Labour chair@@ person Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings and put himself on the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six issues addressed shortly after lunch , with the media likely to be insp@@ ected by the media and the Labour MPs . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Labour leader &apos;s decision to har@@ den on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony at a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the center of several Tit@@ ular pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention . &quot;
&quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow cab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by &apos;s top team , and they called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party supported it as leaders . &quot;
the political correspondent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within Labour &apos;s &quot; st@@ akes &quot; and to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limiting in profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes were made to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the question of the prime minister &apos;s fac@@ tions is to be counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ed , and that he has both &quot; &quot; pot@@ ency &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ kers with resistance and instead committed to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Merkel , the shadow of economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also expressed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ s@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; since it was broadcast on television first in 1990 , the question@@ naire was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism of his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight by the not@@ orious debate of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon thereafter Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rators , and Har@@ rison shou@@ ted : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp@@ f was defeated by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ aul@@ ted by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; a matter of which I am quite ast@@ ute , is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a var@@ ic@@ ose in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a b@@ rac@@ er of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I believe he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os in the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him . &quot;
Macedonia : democracy in crisis or &quot; democracy in blo@@ om &quot; ? !
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency situation and imposed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all parties who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed on the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
&quot; the people who fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a land stre@@ ak on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian Command Police . &quot;
some made food and water from protest food and water .
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ en &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc in Brussels not to reconc@@ ile common immigration policies .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU countries would take more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; but Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a bal@@ eful action from Brussels or his neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency stand in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a barb@@ ed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison ins@@ ults in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;

&quot; the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence , which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; because of the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es emergency state , &quot; said spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ tern in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ orters from Associated Press have already seen in the border with heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Land Security Advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also joined two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia after a draw@@ back with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and put a crowd in order to press down there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
&quot; another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary . &quot;
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national poll
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground . &quot;

&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ er elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than the other candidates .

&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has been fu@@ elled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Hillary Clinton was a second @-@ digit lead in Liber@@ al , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; for example , half of the democratic voters of the election country@@ wide say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party . &quot;

perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially thri@@ lled .
the views are more mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 per cent of the voters of the election campaign say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say about their top candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;

&quot; as the vice @-@ president has a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the voters of the election will see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters of the election would be asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;

&quot; five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters will see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has declined by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voters . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the election is unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results with some important features when choosing the election of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;

&quot; democratic voters of prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters did not think of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; according to Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as an external minister , most of the Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it does not affect their opinions . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public overall .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion still wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;

five members of Brotherhood with the death of Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , when a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pounds back@@ pack full of sand , and was repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call 911 , when Den@@ g was fa@@ inted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , to goo@@ gling his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to take advice , said Poli@@ tk@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , U@@ ten@@ sils , began to hide and set the well @-@ being of Brotherhood basically about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; Poli@@ tk@@ ef Wagner said . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in his injuries next morning . &quot;
&quot; according to an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly inf@@ lic@@ ted with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , hull and th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the ic@@ anen of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury from Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the first five members .
&quot; thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of illegal attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do not want to only be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that officially or officially has sanc@@ tioned it , we will also draw them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;

this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an increase in interest is coming , and the house @-@ se will get into the w@@ elling , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding . &quot;
&quot; therefore representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed that investors should not concentrate when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; contrary to this , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal high@@ s , but still at low levels to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic sho@@ cks that many seem to be afraid . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the removal of interest increases things can make things more vol@@ atile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency of asset yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened to interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ ded later in the Er@@ a cycle , and the return begins to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases they often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that were not before and which could accelerate the recession . &quot;
it is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the fall of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest increases since 1950 had only twice nominal GDP below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the cycle cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing heights very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what is the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months . &quot;

the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs . &quot;

the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a rise in rates between longer and shorter loans and lead to a fl@@ atter of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest loans often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analyst at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;

&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit spread has increased and vol@@ atility has risen - all features of the market , when the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large companies that wrap the larger part of their business activities in the US , benefit from rising interest rates and become more attractive to local products . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as an increasing number of dollars will make their products more expensive on the global market , and also financing their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; said Goldman Sach@@ s analysts in a report on the customer . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , the payment of the re@@ mun@@ eration damage has been approved retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the allow@@ ance compensation was paid only years later , from 2003 when a plus was paid to the account . &quot;

&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleague and killed , Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that &quot; &quot; sorry , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he can &apos;t undo it , &quot; &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lam@@ b , lect@@ urer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; He has shot a man , and someone is killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the staff of the emergency department , Lam@@ b said that police officers must send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but nobody will distur@@ b anyone , but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lam@@ b had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lam@@ b , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lam@@ b went 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing him before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen emb@@ raced him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that the Lam@@ b believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was named by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter that is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss processed online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lam@@ b for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lam@@ b called relatives at a certain time on Monday to say , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to prison . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left external def@@ ender to we@@ ep and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said , &quot; &quot; He has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
&quot; in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , the six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the suspension of a penalty .
&quot; Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian Arb@@ it@@ rator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a Elf@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until the next June . &quot;
&quot; Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball coming into a different direction so that it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

&quot; it is a thing that will soon learn to all parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
it is because you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , the published environmental label of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the site of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children as it always seems to have a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the action of the book , instead re @-@ giving an overview of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the Moor@@ ish city of Th@@ eses @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to see the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; a young man named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; even though he admit to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is not familiar with the action of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has read The Lor@@ ax not 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was likely to come from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ te was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der who has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks &apos;s site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as Spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ te , of course , is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aligned with results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this - players are their own best performers . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the course of Ly@@ te , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; when he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - but this lost opportunity lies in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer I guess .
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends on course of the position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to leave Mo@@ een in addition to cook what an extra spin bow@@ ler and four Qui@@ cks would get , appeared , and I did nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious player of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may have not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous te@@ amm@@ ate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has managed three hundred R@@ uns immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup cra@@ ps that raise their hands and the coaches have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use to the setup .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ equ@@ itable re @-@ action strategy to hold Britain in the EU will go deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ ats fre@@ und said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contract changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not be the case if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbed on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , making a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wants to look outside the UK inside the EU @-@ tent - &quot; L@@ ass not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande sees his re @-@ election or reduction in 2017 .
he is also a burned force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nationalist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ fie British , whose energy should be used to prevent Scottish exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally not plan useful comments , in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ trial was a &quot; &quot; P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as it was during the referendum in 1975 , which supported our admission in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who have made a name as a &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Straight Ban@@ ana &quot; &quot; correspondent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; in all his dec@@ eit@@ fulness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners that most of our large newspapers have . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair thought about it , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ zing than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Blair had rejected the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back@@ door . &quot;

&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back on Monday in West@@ minster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems at risk , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ he years , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just press it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ ep@@ rint and wil@@ der plu@@ mage of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can certainly say Yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs were fighting in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by &apos;s appointment of the provoc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his associates and dep@@ u@@ ties on their exam day on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and before all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , allowing him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to NATO - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in particular , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if everything can be meaning@@ less ?

&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , launched in their report on e cigarettes used by Public Health UK ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e cigarettes . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E published the &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the load capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a leading article in the medical professional journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis , &quot; which was based on PH@@ E &apos;s most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of the evidence and the modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) to create their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette maker , but not the financing that he should have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champions , some of which are also a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .

&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at PH@@ E said that BM@@ J has already responded to the claims of BM@@ J . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smokers die in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term implications . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die every year in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking is the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clari@@ fying current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking causes us to fulfil our national responsibility . &quot;

&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would &quot; &quot; give their right arm &quot; &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs sent , which are not sent by other UK channels . &quot;
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in harsh conten@@ tious time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from Sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 .
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to contact the BBC for six years in Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would be clearly presented by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; said Johnson to the senior communications committee on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I think medium or long term is not for a good idea , one should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I refuse to see how this is to be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t think this would l@@ essen the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , a business@@ man for series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that BBC blame for the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C4 where one can &apos;t measure the public , but they meet their tasks , and they can argue they have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody saw . &quot;
they put them into a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; on the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , we all think that one gets a great value for $ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in the public broadcasting corporations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to question the partnerships El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful were shown on television , and enter Alliances with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
&quot; scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves . &quot;
the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they have a sound impul@@ ses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
impul@@ ses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
topics : economic policy ; Energy policy ; Energy sector ; Environmental policy ; Environmental protection ; Key issues ; Natural resources ; Sectors / commodities ; Sustainability ; Transport ; Transport policy
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that causes electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found it out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves that penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells .
&quot; the sound waves produce the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , so a report of Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when he uses ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmit them into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be extracted from an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bly sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student dor@@ mit@@ ories
&quot; 11 years ago I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ et and Moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy dis@@ comfort over others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the move in student residence halls is from easily nerve @-@ wra@@ pping to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to shame : people tell wh@@ ence you come from where you come , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ore , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverage recipes , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and b@@ ump their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in this context , do not think of catching up with a relationship at the university . &quot;
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back I have used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead .

a guy in my student dor@@ mit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; as you start the Uni on the cli@@ max of Back Man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of brow@@ nies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to bake . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to close friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a permanent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poorly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to be sleeping when you drop . &quot;
to steal food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of mil@@ let for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced deal than my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added a pur@@ se to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hall@@ mark asked her neighbors , if they would make something quiet , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted with even more lu@@ cra@@ tive music .
&quot; when she finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep for two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would coinci@@ de with the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be fundamentally embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future marriage partner , who will be able to go back and see them every day , and maybe you may experience how to pull up all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate definitely is not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his keys in his not closed room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good start is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give you a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but don &apos;t miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and put your keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but grab your pos@@ sessions at the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;

&quot; on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were walking on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ ane , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
&quot; on the premises of the gas station , there were also three people . &quot;
&quot; one of these men now cried out to the young people , and struck the face with the fist . &quot;
&quot; the victim suffered a nose break , and bleeding strongly from the nose . &quot;
&quot; when his two friends r@@ ushed and weigh@@ ed on the ra@@ ckets , he first dismissed from his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the last young man was now brought home . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rator followed the group with a passenger car to their apartment , and drove there demon@@ stra@@ tively multiple times . &quot;
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle anymore , the injured was in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was once again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; under the aid of a stroke , the victim &apos;s face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim were determined . &quot;
the last one had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
&quot; so far , only a v@@ ague case report is present . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters large .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .

&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cros@@ sings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees want to go on to the Croatian border , it is unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to re@@ assure on Wednesday morning at a local ophthalm@@ ologist in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates about alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be for very high refugee numbers . &quot;
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;

&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps where alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still no more spacious min@@ ef@@ ields in parts of the border area . &quot;

&quot; on its most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ og@@ any table to decide whether it is time to raise the grid for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; threatening over them at an end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ story sitting sa@@ ver is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that F@@ ed president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here .
&quot; but since the great recession , F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ even third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data in the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the most cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives afraid to rein@@ force this vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which makes itself uns@@ ett@@ led to itself the financial market . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were interviewed recently by Bloom@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the pro@@ position , unless the strateg@@ ists re@@ lie@@ ve the blow by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift up the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if it does , it would have to go very far in its explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm down the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; yet another month ago the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints of Liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .

wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the strain on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world were bound together by the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would increase global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , the Dow is now around 10 % lower than in May . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; if events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the past few weeks would not have occurred , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot;
now he pre@@ suppos@@ es that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically in their decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the final effect , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years .

&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ er , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for a increase in interest , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;

&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of a increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mand@@ ate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should rush time . &quot;

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian Pan@@ di@@ at@@ rian Organisation of Spr@@ S is trying to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition is during bre@@ ast@@ feeding times . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck on breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by around 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should take . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;

&quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday , when ten people were at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany was surprisingly set on Sunday because of the flood of flood the railway traffic with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein conclusion , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and crossed the border together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we left the un@@ trusted guests only once , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring it to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course , &quot; said Stad@@ ler at the O@@ Ö@@ N meeting . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au in order to make it possible after the short notice that railway traffic was stopped after Germany , but still on the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was shut down at the border at W@@ ern@@ stein on the Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;

that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending more Z@@ ig@@ s to us is a logical result of hypo@@ critical politics :
&quot; instead of helping to build structures that ensure Human@@ ity , our Federal Chancellor has officially opened the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis des National Socialism . &quot;
Lei@@ d@@ bearing of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced with cha@@ otic states .
&quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; gel@@ ob@@ ed country &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter , to establish decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good .
&quot; if he expressed himself foreign @-@ hostile , journalists or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy , the applicant for the US presidential office will boost the election campaign . &quot;

&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous children , to which besides Tr@@ ump the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for hum@@ ility , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;

&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , senior district officials said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside of a police station , while some of you threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police were used tear gas and then fired into the air before they pulled back on rubber feet .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber feet used , of which it is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , evi@@ dently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last few weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ al@@ ese southern pla@@ ins , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ acc@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed as part of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
&quot; there were protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want to have their own state . &quot;
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal which has been governed for centuries . &quot;

&quot; for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is too early to say if slightly obes@@ e people live longer with diabetes after weight loss surgery than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a guide to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity treatments have proven to be effective in type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted with people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data they have collected in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ ction - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I under which this operation under@@ went , from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease triggered a total of 28 % . &quot;

&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the conduc@@ tive researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching higher levels in BM@@ I ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study showed no survival benefit in surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , obes@@ e people were subjected to obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have joined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the UK during his speech at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response from Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; in order to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the problem of violence , and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and revealed that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;

four @-@ fold increase of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ lows heavy alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants reported in children under 12 years , the poison control centers reported , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children deliberately drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation among social media . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
teenagers have mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mouth water to get a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange fragrance , which are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 % alcohol .
&quot; especially with small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the toxic emergency centre at the University of Kansas , the transm@@ itter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in range of children , and when children come from it , it is a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four spray @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants in school , was brought to treatment in an emergency . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was legal in an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who was treated outside Atlanta in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te their words and was unable to go when they arrived at the emergency reception .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and thr@@ ust their head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; it was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand san@@ iti@@ zer outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; in addition to alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 two women died in Ontario after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol contained a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ ylene alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three pupils of the fourth class in the state New York planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teachers by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police considered the ver@@ itable plan as &quot; &quot; ul@@ sten@@ ed &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot;

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison injection . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is chosen . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media locations from 12 to five .
those who will be selected will be able to observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .

&quot; she said that it could have been better form@@ ulating , but she still thinks that it is wrong to do what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Hello , I enjoy reading a@@ all of your article post . I wanted to write a little comment to support you . &#124; &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts series that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying of unnecessary death .

Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the race sport
Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he was quoted on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they had a personal campaign against him with Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media , that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cob@@ alt probe at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held himself 18 months for es@@ pion@@ age allegations , and did not want it to look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have long been eating , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything is coming out , &quot; Moody said . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk up@@ stairs , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before , Moody announced the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had attempted to spy on its stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; Moody said on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to capture me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Ken@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , reig@@ ning President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and still are still today . &quot;
should I think that it is personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L stand to be co@@ war@@ dly and perhaps people outside of Train@@ ers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
I &apos;m so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ strations levels of the train@@ ers have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching led to the fact that he was able to throw his license through the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known by its preparation of the un@@ beaten master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has mistakenly carried the mud on the leg . &quot;
it would have been so late last night .
it could have been the whole day that was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moody could face a three month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one is too far , &quot; Moody said . &quot;

&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team , and said they were only focused on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it was the first time that the team had the chance to win the medal race . &quot;
&quot; I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring events when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and that has provided us the turn@@ sti@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he obviously has a great team . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this is always coming up to this season .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a shit . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot;
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games . &quot;
&quot; also , Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys . &quot;
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
do you want to report this message ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that in a phase we will meet them . &quot;

&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals fell to this segment according to the German Kraft@@ fahrt Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) in August . &quot;
this is reflected in the IAA ( audience days from the 17th to 27th September ) .

&quot; in order to make the volume model well @-@ sold , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf in prospect , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .

&quot; both assumptions seem unrealistic : for example , the impact of a global shock is likely to vary from one region to another . in this issue on regional labour markets , Norbert Schanne employs novel methods in spatial econometrics to describe and forecast their development . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them in the beginning , critici@@ zes Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find out whether they are working in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turning point : from the ban on employment for refugees to the recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to restri@@ ct asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;
&quot; this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothetical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015 &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .

the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management is distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the education capacities - for example by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared without knowledge of German knowledge in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also of teachers who have only one qualification in German as second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s case from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state does not say asylum seek@@ ers or commem@@ orative studies - the only exception was Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than half of the population &apos;s population has been affected by the lack of access to the higher education institution . &quot;

&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ um@@ b to Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state church law will develop into a new state religion . &quot;
&quot; it is important for the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers . &quot;
the rights are also duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to clean up certain control possibilities . &quot;
&quot; this also includes the willingness to go ahead against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern , religious conflicts could also be submitted to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to get rid of such conflicts in Germany , &quot; now have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bavarian Broad@@ casting Corporation . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be a topic of the whole society more than today . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; as a result of European decisions , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination institution for a decade and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NSU trial series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the previously expected refugees , says Doc@@ tor@@ al President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;

&quot; in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to save as many people with the restricted performance catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er performance law prev@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , doctors worry about creating language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has shown that migrants are worse than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in doctor pra@@ ises , interpre@@ ters need to be taken over , demands them . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would be helped with more general medical start @-@ ups in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugee children there are much more untreated disabilities , and among young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with some other diseases of the disease German doctors come from their training , however , Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in order to prac@@ tise , however , they have to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; in particular , refugee children are particularly vulnerable to refugee children , declar@@ ing Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study conducted by TU Munich prove that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .

&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong sho@@ el@@ iness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms chron@@ ically , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ically sick asylum seek@@ ers can pose a request for a psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , however , the processing takes place several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , doctors or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

Poroshenko to speak at UN General Assembly meeting dedicated to large movements of refugees
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats , and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had re@@ sted it and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the Speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians receive SMS messages on their phones they warned against Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; she warns the members of Parliament that immun@@ ity is in the Parliament , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief spokesman said Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers of politicians .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as a stand @-@ alone company we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers throughout the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than € 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement . &quot;
it split a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in order to manufacture electro @-@ systems and the Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring to handle the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .

&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation is proce@@ eding according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer of the European Championship is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal properly .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd. records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since his debut six years ago .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 which have recorded most of the injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil rider but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a prone period of time , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win fighting force , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team . &quot;
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia ; what means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to indul@@ ge a little break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al is clear favour@@ ites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ating effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale 3.@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and continues to lead the association with its first European cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al yet .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;

Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Comedy @-@ Show which gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open themselves now even more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year ho@@ ch prove . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 , as the year of the man , aims to ask the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication related to social media , with its focus on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , vibrant and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the football look in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can relate to each case even if they are often reluct@@ ant to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the telephone pastoral care , it explained to me : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ confident , really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so , my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone can help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ celebration with the completely re@@ designed backdrop to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting around you alone , give him a smile and say Hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
&quot; di Maria meets , to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush mal@@ m@@ ö &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , and helps PS@@ G to pass on Mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ son Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League Season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ parking Stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion to the way , but after that they missed a number of opportunities before reaching their advantage when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master , as they do not only aim to qualify for the K.@@ D. rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a clas@@ ses@@ of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ stream in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to get our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected over the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ k was called the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he was in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis &apos;s pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defense , he ended up beautiful in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone thought that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off hit the stage , came up with nine national players in the field , and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field , a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but except a shot from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ ste in the 3@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ passes and bad connections , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was only scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his te@@ amm@@ ers to the game , and it was a pass by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , whom Di Maria was turned into a shot shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth win after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had left a left flank of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result down before the waiting list Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized by the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ding , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league that did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays host variety in film making
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ American film maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night von H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives on a black protagon@@ ist on the project &apos;s chosen screen@@ play . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with ins@@ ulting un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian were soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te , beaten by her white sugar . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the film direction ; Dam@@ on replies that their direction &quot; at the end of us could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;

&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 sa@@ w@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the precise racial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Matter posted a country @-@ wide effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against farming . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a play on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leader of the movement Black Li@@ ves Matter has published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , if the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Matter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said . &quot;
&quot; recently , Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport climbing and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prize of $ 1 Million with home .
&quot; the competition show , which finished her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the finals . &quot;
the last task was the climbing at a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior , but Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster what made him vic@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prize of 1 Million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned or live more than 10,000 dollars or to live , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. like I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter , to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changing life , it receives the great degree of gra@@ tification . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minnesota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
the Tw@@ ins spent a chance for as@@ cen@@ sion within a single half of Houston astro@@ s for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return to the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon stopped his early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then in the sixth and then again in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three races .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to quit this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to concentrate completely on the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits , and was in two laps , his first runs since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has well v@@ owed the wood , &quot; &quot; said Eli@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( punch training ) , saw clearly better off the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , Tw@@ ins had their best chance to get back into the game again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to the stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted with front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who took a two @-@ run from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end run , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was this season in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe defeated a Double Play

&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , stops S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for its fifth save . &quot;
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three races against the right @-@ handed veteran , who had been painted in front of the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having been missing for a month due to a back bond . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runners in the scoring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , made another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;

&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; he did not particularly well beaten , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came three races with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .

&quot; so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protest@@ ant mist@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; then the up@@ bringing happened with the cane stock , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work that , in order to be able to forgive me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to make art more important in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked today by advertising , and it is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is being pushed out .
artists have another desire and pleasure to show things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall into the pictures , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the picture looks for itself . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ tes &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not pay attention to completely compreh@@ end the Bible , but chosen for him important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ tes images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and the responsibility .

&quot; the theme will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football is able to help and wants to help .

some federal lists support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals have a clear indication if they are on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; We will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; said the manager Rudi Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to use soccer @-@ federal lists , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : display mannequins , which are terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , including Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men into skirts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the En@@ f@@ ant , the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past , it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he was on the other hand , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the barely over@@ looked work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork for which a lot of effort was done : to revit@@ alize the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;

&quot; in the past , it went on the long needle @-@ machines in and around Plau@@ en to make a meter . &quot;

&quot; this is no longer working today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the fashion industry Plau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Plau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewellery , with accessories such as bags and in regional costumes . &quot;

&quot; Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the &quot; &quot; Schne@@ eber@@ ger &quot; &quot; branch of the Z@@ wick@@ au University - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot;
&quot; to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that have to think economically , &quot; Schmidt says . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly variable to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter is new to the historic snow@@ ball tip . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sti@@ cks small kitchens at some places . &quot;
&quot; the Plau@@ ener Gold@@ smith in Bi@@ anca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Krau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; before , I could not start with a traditional chat . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it pre@@ suppos@@ es the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plau@@ en and the surrounding area and who would like to have a piece of souven@@ irs . &quot;
so I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plau@@ ener Spitze .

&quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and drive reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state establishments ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the resident mel@@ ee system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that do not come into question for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , since it has a major role in providing resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ state business environment and open the market more open , the statement said . &quot;
&quot; the government will also temp@@ t controls over the powers transferred to companies , and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot;
