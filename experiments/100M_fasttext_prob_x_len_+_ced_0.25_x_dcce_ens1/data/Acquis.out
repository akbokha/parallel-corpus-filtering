&quot; II ) Information about plants will be limited to minimum , which is necessary for the use of security measures in relation to core material that is subject to the securing measures in accordance with the Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) On request of the community , the organization is prepared to consider investment data that the community considers to be particularly vulnerable in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not need to be materi@@ ally transferred to the organization , provided they remain accessible for further testing by the organization in the premises of the Community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization takes the approval of the community and states to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) With@@ draw the community either against a proposed denom@@ ination or at any time against a different designation , the organization of the Community and the States suggests one or more alternatives . &quot;
&quot; if due to the repeated refusal of the community to consent to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors of the organization , the Council shall discuss the refusal , after it has been addressed by the General Director of the Organization - in the following as &quot; &quot; General Director &quot; &quot; - in doing so , with the aim of meeting the appropriate measure . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the concerned states undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , in fact , can actually fu@@ elling them according to their agreement . &quot;
( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are set up in such a way that i ) are the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information is ensured by inspec@@ tors of the organization .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and funds , as well as its inspec@@ tors and other officials , to perform tasks according to the Convention , the relevant provisions of the agreement on the Privil@@ eg@@ es and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this Convention are termin@@ ated with regard to core material , when the community and the organization realise that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable or practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the community not@@ ices the organization according to this Convention , the transfer of core material from the States , which is subject to the security measures in accordance with the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with the Convention shall be termin@@ ated with regard to core material , as soon as the receiver state , as fores@@ een in this Convention , has taken responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries out documents from which each passing on , and possibly , the re @-@ application of the security measures to the given core material . &quot;

II ) that the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons during the duration of non @-@ application of the securing measures after this Convention .
B ) The organization and community meet a provision that the safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention will not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; in the provision , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these safegu@@ ards should not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any event , the safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention will be re @-@ applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear action . &quot;
&quot; the organization will be kept up to date on the total quantity and composition of this material , in the state or in the states concerned , and on any passing on such material from this state or states . &quot;
&quot; this explains their consent as swi@@ f@@ tly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include an endor@@ sement or conce@@ aled knowledge of the military activity , and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , community and states bear the costs incurred by each of them in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , states or individuals who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special request for the organization , the organization ref@@ uses these costs as long as it has agreed beforehand . &quot;

&quot; the community and states ensure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be applied to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as on the nation@@ als of the States . &quot;
any claim that the Community or State vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization in relation to the organization or a state due to damage - except for damages from a nuclear incident - is determined in accordance with international law .
&quot; after examining the relevant fac@@ tual information submitted by the General Director , the Council is unable to verify that no core material that must be subject to security measures for nuclear weapons or other nuclear weapons must be reimbur@@ sed for nuclear weapons or other nuclear weapons . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which weight has been obtained by the security measures applied , provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two contrac@@ ting parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to provide the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state , consult@@ ations are held on questions arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention , are examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to take part in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; any disputes resulting from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be resolved , except for disputes resulting from the interpretation or application of this Convention , which shall not be made in the negotiation process or by another by the organization , the community and the States , to submit to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and states design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four so named arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth , who leads the chair@@ manship . &quot;
&quot; if the community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days after the application for an arbit@@ ration claim , the community or organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure is to apply if within thirty days after the nam@@ ing or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the arbit@@ ration tri@@ bunal shall be competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding upon the organisation , the community and the countries concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contrac@@ ting party of the contract , and members of the community ( in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures for entry into force of this Convention are concluded and &quot;
&quot; ( II ) if the organization of the organization not@@ ices , that it is able to apply its security measures to this state for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , community and states consult each other on request of one of the contrac@@ ting parties for a change of this Convention . &quot;

B ) This Convention remains in force as long as the states are contrac@@ ting party of the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol .
&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I , as required by securing measures . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the safegu@@ ards defined in this Convention is the timely discovery of the jun@@ ctions of significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes , as well as det@@ err@@ ence from such an exit due to the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; to obtain the target set in article 28 , material accounting is used as a backup measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
the technical conclusion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity for each material balance sheet is specified for a certain period of time with indication of the accuracy limit for the specified amounts .
&quot; in carrying out their investigations , the organization after article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their security measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following manner and shall , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined in the supplementary agreements and are practical : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for the determination of the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost , or in other ways out of the stock of distant core material and the stock of stock ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of the measurements and the estim@@ ation of the measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determining , checking and evalu@@ ating differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recipients ; &quot;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essing appropri@@ ations of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and report system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes in this inventory , including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
&quot; ( g ) provisions , ensuring that accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ; &quot;
h ) Proced@@ ure of reporting reports to the organization in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) the amount and composition of the material , which is described by the letter c ) , is incorporated into the states , if it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) the core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ opic enrich@@ ment , or the process phase in which it is manufactured or will be introduced into the states in a later phase of the core fuel cycle , so it is subject to the security measures listed in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the conditions stipul@@ ated in Article 11 are not possible or desired , the organization and community consult one another about the use of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The security measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated in accordance with Article 13 conditions stipul@@ ated in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are im@@ percep@@ tible that this core material is practically non @-@ profit . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ opic concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 which is above 80 % .
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization releases core material that would otherwise be subject to security measures following this Convention , provided that the total material quantity released in the states is at no point at any time &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
( III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium counts by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ;
&quot; a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot;
&quot; if the core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization complementary distances , which are necessary for the successful and effective fulfil@@ lment of the tasks of the organization in accordance with this Convention , in detail how the procedures defined in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or am@@ ended without alter@@ ing this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the organization , community and states undertake all efforts to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial report referred to in article 62 , the organization presents a summari@@ zed inventory of the main material in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory on the basis of the following reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is imp@@ eded by universal reset @-@ cent@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ encing problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and the Member States , that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound to enter into force within six months and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
d ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the centre bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; &quot; special transaction account &quot; &quot; which is made up of the funds that the Member States can contribute to the special transaction account ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; ste@@ wards &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is separately and separately managed by all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment takes place in the form of cash or in@@ solven@@ cy deb@@ its of the Member State , which must be paid upon request in the currency of the State concerned at the Order of the Organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited at the administrative office of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two rates ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrative appointed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the contribution of the contribution to 1 January 1979 , or at any other time agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Any Member State may wish to make payments before the a@@ forementioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional traction on the cash or the school d@@ ashes to cover expenses for the special transaction loans and compensate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; when gran@@ ting this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by following factors in accordance with the terms of the E@@ EC : &quot;
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit absorption capacity on loan terms without compensation ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly re@@ cover@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral process ) , which is considered , approved , and administered according to the procedures and practices of the organization financed by the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the non @-@ transaction account must not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the day of entry into force . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization ; they are thus rep@@ ay@@ able in ten years of free time in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; temporary loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts for payment of this fee must be paid directly to the organization which it reserves .
&quot; any special transaction loan can be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the benef@@ ici@@ ary or for goods or services that are manufactured or provided in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries which have set the car@@ et@@ aker at the time of loan granted , benef@@ ici@@ aries of a special transaction tax . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ considered as soon as possible from the administrator to the member state . &quot;
&quot; until the completion of all special transactions loans , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the inspection by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the period of withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses incurred for this . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the Administrator transm@@ its an extensive billing of the special transaction account with a statement by the external Audi@@ tor of the Organization for this statement . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the E@@ EC &apos;s car@@ et@@ aker will soon receive a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special financial account . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs appropriate records and accounts recei@@ vable from which the contributions to the financial account , the amounts paid to the account and the funds paid out of the account and the payments to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ ward to the full edition of the assets of the special transaction account , lead to an exchange of ideas on the state of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed through special transactions , and on any other questions that concern the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; is this agreement not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date which the E@@ EC and the organization may not enter into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties are due with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement , the entire amount of capital returned to the recei@@ vers and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties have ended with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States listed the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Secretary @-@ General conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
&quot; this agreement is effective and entered into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the stated noti@@ fications in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is translated into two sentences in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with every wording equally authentic . &quot;
considering that the agreement in the form of a correspondence to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE VER@@ OR@@ CU@@ LA@@ TION :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called Eur@@ atom , represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; is represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; Federal Council . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large trial facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are referred to as &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET &quot; below . &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still carrying out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contrac@@ ting parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research , which have gained a higher priority on the basis of the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable any contrac@@ ting party to get the greatest possible benefit by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for the research work , i.e. the cost @-@ effective competitive power generation by utili@@ zing the controlled core fusion response , faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contractual parties associate their respective research programmes in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over long @-@ term goals and the forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; every time the contrac@@ ting parties adopt a new program , this occurs at the place of the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the association appointed in paragraph 1 shall be realized by : - appropriate participation of each of the contrac@@ ting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that collaborate on Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; within the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this agreement , the contractual parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of human resources exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , below &quot; agreement on personnel exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the present agreement to the Common company J@@ ET , whose constitution it accepts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the organs commissioned by carrying out the association en@@ vis@@ aged in Article 2 of 1 of the present agreement are described in articles 5 to 10 of this agreement and the association agreement .
&quot; the association agreement shall in particular include the suspension of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Council of the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of research work , and to guide the best possible results in line with the goals of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group , which is used as part of the Eur@@ atom program , in the following &quot; VG . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the VG , who has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities within the Eur@@ atom program , is undertaking this task with regard to all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and establishes their T * ity in the interests of the two contractual parties to the common objective specified in the Eur@@ atom program and in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are due . &quot;
&quot; pursuant to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives to the advice groups created within the Eur@@ atom program , whenever the responsible Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the groups of consultants who provide the best possible scientific results with regard to the Eur@@ atom program , take this task with regard to all research and development work , which is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the Committee of directors to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and which is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the programme , lead to this task in terms of all research and development work , which fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , he ensures the best possible use of the staff and the exchange of the same between the laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all the coordin@@ ating committees applied within the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the coordin@@ ating committees , which provide appropriate suggestions for the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , have the task in the respective field with regard to all research and development works , which fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is a member of each member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any affiliated third country responsible for the core and energy research . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission regarding the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in the preparation of future programs and the definition of their overall size , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Gover@@ ning Board , the Consult@@ ants and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have an advisory character . &quot;
the VG &apos;s position on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of the directors in the field of human resources exchange .
the representatives of the two parties work on the work of all technical advisory bodies or of all administrative bodies created for the purpose of the present agreement .
&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland to the Eur@@ atom program according to this agreement is set to an amount each year , as the gross domestic product of Switzerland is the total gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Market as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland assign@@ s an amount to the common company J@@ ET , which is determined according to the financial provisions of the Stat@@ ute of this Joint Company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , the Eur@@ atom to finance the work in the context of the association agreement and the agreement on human resources exchange , is calculated on the same basis that is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to the financing of the work based on the relevant tre@@ aties . &quot;
&quot; the Commission agrees to the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which is intended to cover expenses within the Eur@@ atom program for the year concerned . &quot;
the Federal Council pays the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 . January and 5 / 12 before 15 .
July . the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are set in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland is taking all necessary measures to exemp@@ t Eur@@ atom of tari@@ ffs or other charges , as well as import restrictions and restrictions on the part of the items which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the items acquired or bought there may not be sold separately in this country , unless in terms of conditions approved by the Federal Council . &quot;
these exemp@@ tions are not applicable to ro@@ ckets and loans that are paid to these persons .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge provided in Article 2 of 1 of the present agreement shall be governed by Article 14 and 15 of this agreement , in the association agreement and in the agreement on the exchange of personnel . &quot;
the provisions on access to the knowledge applicable to Switzerland &apos;s involvement in the common company J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this agreement and in the Stat@@ ute of the Joint Company .

I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the following .
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the demands of the Member States as part of the medium @-@ term financial crisis
the BI@@ S could close the stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries when banks provide a corresponding application .
&quot; the agreement could be closed down to the total amount of the contribution paid by credi@@ tor land to the mechanism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; already , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; in any stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would first take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als continu@@ ances without being exceeded for a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as for the extension of the extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first draw would not be made prior to the exp@@ ir@@ ation of a month after conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the draw would occur in the currencies available at the BI@@ S , probably in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time considering the funds of the Bank , presum@@ ably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those used by the BI@@ S at the respective time on similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate applicable to the application could achieve a maximum which is equivalent to a corresponding margin of Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would send me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on the trade with a mut@@ ton and lamb
&quot; I honor myself to take on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat in relation to the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for mut@@ ton , lamb and goat meat from Argentina will be set to the following annual quantity : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ asses weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure fla@@ w@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to the usual offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties agree to each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under the number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community makes use of the protective clause , it oblig@@ ates itself to ensure that the access of Argentina to the joint market is not affected in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the comm@@ union comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products recorded by this agreement to a tes@@ tic@@ ular sentence of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the community changes in consultation with Argentina to the extent of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States shall be set in compliance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , which is taken into account under the number 5 named &quot; &quot; Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ment of Ex@@ haus@@ tion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the total number mentioned under number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 23 000 tons of car@@ c@@ asses weight .
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an Hamm@@ el and lam@@ b@@ ums on the joint market within agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community makes precau@@ tions so that the sales of intervention stocks of frozen meat are not under@@ min@@ ed due to the regulation of the regulation of the Argent@@ ine@@ an hammer and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for the export of Hamm@@ el and lamb , as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will only take place at prices and conditions which comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms shall be interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular , that the quantities stipul@@ ated in this agreement shall be issued for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; in its part , the comm@@ union comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions to make the gran@@ ting of import licenses to the a@@ forementioned products with origin in Argentina on the submission of a export licence , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a bond for the gran@@ ting of the import license for the products of question cannot be wai@@ ved .
&quot; it is also stipul@@ ated that the responsible Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals has been issued in regular intervals , for which export licenses have been issued ; this information may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country . &quot;
the committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the tendency on the mut@@ ton , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions which are of importance for the purpose mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will not be carried out according to the agreement mentioned in the agreement . &quot;
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising from the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount determined by number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 January .
&quot; the amount paid by the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual quantity , contributing to the seasonal character of trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a deadline of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any event , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties prior to 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary to be deemed necessary . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to share your government &apos;s approval .

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honor myself to take on the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions on imports of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand into the Community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for mut@@ ton , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; acknowled@@ ging the fact that the sheep economy and the export of Hamm@@ el and lamb after the world market , and especially after the community for New Zealand &apos;s economy , must be ensured , and that the normal he@@ el of New Zealand Hamm@@ el and lamb is not affected in these markets , I ad@@ ore the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of access to the market of the Community is ensured in the amount determined at the agreement . &quot;

a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human whol@@ eness from which the largest part of plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been won ; other blood cells can be present or may have been partially removed .
&quot; the fluid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial irrig@@ ation solution , which was added after removal of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; the volume of red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approxim@@ ate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for manufacture must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the filling must be carried out under the use of a ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;

&quot; the human dry plasma is extracted through drying of the liquid , which de@@ compos@@ es in the case of cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gi@@ zation or sedi@@ mentation of human blood . &quot;
the human hydr@@ o plasma is produced by cold ro@@ cking or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the quantity of liquids , from which one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
the protein concentration of the obtained solution must not be less than 45 g per litre and the solution must not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products .
donations in which ( using a fresh sample ) a hazardous content of in@@ dem@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune hem@@ o@@ glut@@ in@@ ins have been determined are excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after blood withdrawal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood sample of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in the plasma , blood donations are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be proven in a blood sample of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the risk of the transfer of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation hepatitis , bl@@ ends are to be taken to reduce the plasma treatment that does not contain more than 12 donations , or other methods that are known to reduce this danger in a comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; one of the fluid levels , from which one went out in the production of the plasma , is to be added ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the quantity of water , which corresponds to the quantity of fluid from which it was produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;

&quot; the World Health Organisation has defined Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ Stress and In@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group determination of international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , norms are currently being elabor@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to determine blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation . &quot;
&quot; the title indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series , in which a microsc@@ opic , visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which the International standard prepar@@ ates exist ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in comparison to the International standard prepar@@ atory or state standard prepar@@ atory in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) . &quot;

the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ ffy form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the fe@@ asi@@ bility trials ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of infected gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container where they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penet@@ rate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying on phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance remains the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml flu@@ kes or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ ums .
&quot; re@@ agents , regardless of whether in fluid form or after re@@ activation , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the quantity contained in a container must be so great that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents to determine the blood @-@ group determination in written records .
&quot; adequate rehear@@ s@@ als of all re@@ agents have to be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it is prob@@ able that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used in the blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and preservation of the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups following the origin of their active part . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; every single box is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

these ser@@ a are therefore specific for C an@@ tigen only when the tested blood cells are heated in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent bo@@ iling solution .
&quot; the ti@@ er of the anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 against c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells . &quot;

anti @-@ E Ser@@ um is extracted from the blood of one or more individuals who are imm@@ uni@@ zed by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and in no form Anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of imm@@ uni@@ zed persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D using Anti @-@ C or Anti @-@ E Ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies must be effective at the same time , among the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction should not be less than the proportion@@ ate antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A ser@@ um is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it does not contain any human red blood cells containing no A @-@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;

&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5 to 10 percent in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2 and A@@ 2B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur at any in@@ undation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a standard prepar@@ atory of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it does not contain any human red blood cells containing no B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding pres@@ elec@@ tor , with an in@@ undation of blood cells from group B to Tit@@ aments ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the Anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a similar amount of a 5@@ - to 10 percent in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time that is required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin ser@@ um for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals that are imm@@ uni@@ zed by injection of human ser@@ um proteins .
&quot; it is used as prescribed by the manufacturer , so ag@@ glut@@ inated there are no un@@ laden human red blood cells , regardless of which blood group they belong . &quot;

&quot; each contrac@@ ting party is taking appropriate measures to ensure an effective and balanced implementation of this agreement , whereby the need to be taken into account is to reduce the transport bur@@ dens that are subjected to goods traffic as far as possible and to provide satisfactory solutions to all sides arising from the conditions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the areas in which the treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand , as well as for the regions of the EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;
( 2 ) This Convention applies also to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein as long as the Princip@@ ality with the Swiss Con@@ federation is bound by a customs union treaty .

CHANGE to the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System to design@@ ate and codi@@ fy the goods ( Brussels events on 24 June 1986 )
&quot; the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a council for cooperation in the field of customs , &quot;
&quot; in DER A@@ wak@@ ening , it is desirable that the International Convention entered into force on 14 June 1983 in Brussels on the designation and enco@@ ding of the goods on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in DER Re@@ assignment , that without a change in Article 13 of the Convention on the date of entry into force , this Convention would continue to remain in@@ secure - &quot;
&quot; article 13 of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the Desig@@ nation and codi@@ fication of the Goods , which is referred to in Brussels on 14 June 1983 in Brussels , receives the following version : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention shall take effect on January 1 , which follows after the exp@@ iry of at least three months immediately , to which at least sev@@ ent@@ een of the countries or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ists have signed the Convention with no reservation of rati@@ fication or have depos@@ ited its rati@@ fication or affili@@ ation documents , but not before 1 January 1988 . &quot;
A. This protocol shall come into force at the same time with the Convention in force if at least sev@@ ent@@ een of the states or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ists have depos@@ ited their document on the receipt of the protocol at the Council &apos;s Sec@@ retariat for cooperation in the field of customs .
&quot; however , only countries or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ists may submit the certificate of acceptance of this protocol , which have previously signed the Convention without pre@@ ju@@ dice to rati@@ fication or at the same time sub@@ mitting their document of rati@@ fication or accession to the Convention or at the same time . &quot;
&quot; B . every state and any customs or economic union , the contrac@@ ting party of the Convention pursuant to the entry into force of this Protocol in accordance with paragraph A , is the contrac@@ ting party of the Convention in the version modified by the protocol . &quot;
&quot; a plant which is indispensable not only for the maintenance and maintenance of so@@ ils , but also allows the exploitation of land that does not allow any other plant@@ ing , and which , even in extensive management , which constitutes the main part of today &apos;s production , has responded favor@@ ably to any improvement in cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DAR@@ AU@@ F , that its cultivation depends on the existence and living standards of millions of families that are , in turn , completely dependent on the measures required to maintain and expand the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in the non @-@ producing consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DAR@@ AU@@ F , olive oil and table olive oil are essential ingredients in the areas in which the olive growing is common ; &quot;
&quot; in consideration of the importance of olive production , the essential feature of olive production is the in@@ regul@@ arity of crops and market supply , and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues , as well as to very different gro@@ wers ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DAR@@ AU@@ F , this creates all particular difficulties which seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the general policy of economic growth in the countries that are in zones where olive growing is common ; &quot;

protocol to the Convention of 1979 over large @-@ scale gr@@ en@@ sible air pollution concerning the fight against emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or its gr@@ en@@ ched flow
&quot; concerned that the current emissions of air @-@ poll@@ uting substances in exposed parts of Europe and North America cause damage to natural value for the environment and the economy , &quot;
&quot; remember that the Executive Committee has acknowledged the need to effectively reduce the annual general emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des from stationary and mobile sources or their gr@@ en@@ sible flow by 1995 , as well as the need for states that have already made progress in reducing emissions to nitrogen oxide emissions and verify , &quot;
&quot; taking into account existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and effects of nitrogen oxi@@ des and their follow @-@ up products to the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions , &quot;
&quot; determined to take effective measures to combat and reduce annual national emissions from nitrogen oxi@@ des or its gr@@ en@@ ched flow , particularly by applying appropriate national emission limits for new mobile larger site sources , as well as by retro@@ fitting existing major sources of location , &quot;
&quot; recognis@@ ing that the scientific and technical knowledge about these issues is further developed and that this development is to be taken into account in the review of the application of this protocol and in deciding on further measures , &quot;
&quot; recognis@@ ing that the dra@@ fting of a solution approach based on critical loads is the creation of an effective scientific basis for the purpose of taking into account the application of this protocol and in deciding on other internationally agreed measures , &quot;
recognis@@ ing that the initial examination of procedures for the creation of more favorable conditions for a technology exchange will contribute to effective reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions in the Commission region ;
&quot; taking note of satisfaction that several states have mut@@ ually agreed to reduce their annual national emissions from nitrogen oxi@@ des , and to considerable extent , &quot;
