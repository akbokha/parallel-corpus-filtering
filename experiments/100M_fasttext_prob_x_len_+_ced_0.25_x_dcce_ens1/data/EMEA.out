this document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations about the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) as a solution for inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder where patients can alternate man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal mood ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent chronic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral in@@ gest@@ ing of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used to absorb or melt tablets in patients , which causes the swal@@ lowing of tablets trouble . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , as well as bili@@ fy , the dose of bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this does not affect the transmission of brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other . &quot;
aria is probably primarily known as &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for recep@@ tors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain whereby psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms are reduced and their recur@@ rence is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , or similar disorders that suffered severe un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased rest@@ lessness , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
all studies examined the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to intake .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received am@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than those who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; when applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies decreased man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
abili@@ fy also prevented more efficacy than plac@@ ebo for recur@@ rence of chronic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of bili@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyram@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controlled Zu@@ cken ) , Ac@@ ath@@ ens ( constant movement ) , hyper@@ tension , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , when oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of bili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhal@@ er is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after altern@@ ation of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiac disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including accum@@ ulative and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; if there are signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia with abili@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol had an increased risk of mort@@ ality compared to the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with a fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow immediate compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect , and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with over@@ l@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ ig@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically non @-@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites may result in the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
&quot; considering the joint administration of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ es with abili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy . &quot;
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 m@@ g. Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; this drug may not be used during pregnancy due to the insufficient data situation for people and due to the concerns produced in reproductive studies at the animal , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol does not have a negative impact on it . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ens , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study , over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ rup@@ tions - in a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 22.@@ 5 % was reported in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under operi@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks with a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clinical significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; cavi@@ ties of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events related to antibiotic therapy include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has high plasma cutting . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine absorption and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recep@@ tors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ A receptor as well as an even aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 receptor , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks on healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ c @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ file . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who contributed a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary destinations , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , aria was significantly higher for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for more than 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior effectiveness against plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy effect compared to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partly did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed itself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , primarily in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ isation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ ening is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the average Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol with extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers on CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ability toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ero@@ genous potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans so they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the g@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole are no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ times of the mean Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine absorption and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recep@@ tors .
&quot; 22 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed itself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , primarily in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing abili@@ fy tablets may be able to take the melt tablets as an alternative to abili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders were reported in some cases after the beginning or after altern@@ ation of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing states of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect , and may lead to serious complications . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to prevent recur@@ rence of some episodes in patients receiving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the therapy should continue with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow immediate compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy subjects a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 22.@@ 5 % was reported in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine absorption and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recep@@ tors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for more than 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with a single or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior effectiveness against plac@@ ebo .
the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) was found in a relative Bi@@ over@@ feed Study .
&quot; 99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the g@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ times of the mean Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control as@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under casing of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is indicated , see the summary of the features of the drug to abili@@ fy tablets , abili@@ fy sm@@ elt tabl@@ etten or abili@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution in patients with a@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution , patients should be observed regarding extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure lowering ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injec@@ tions are not available to patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( prescribed by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiac disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including accum@@ ulative and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , sti@@ ff@@ ness , change of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect , and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of Sed@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly used as single @-@ use intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly , and who simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ ig@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically non @-@ relevant . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites may result in the common use with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were intr@@ amus@@ cular , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified in clinical trials with or@@ ally applied Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of eps 19 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was reported in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks with a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clinical significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; cavi@@ ties of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3,5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events related to antibiotic therapy include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant major improvements of as@@ certain@@ ties / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as angi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution associated with plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the observed mean improvement from bas@@ eline on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe at@@ tainment , a similar effectiveness has been observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical signature could be determined based on a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who contributed a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary destinations , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for more than 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially failed to reflect lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed itself superior to plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , primarily in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after in@@ tra @-@ amus@@ cular injection than tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time for achieving the maximum plasma level is 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys , resulting in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application during systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - or 5 times higher than the maximum human@@ otherapeu@@ tic exposure of 30@@ mg intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ mal ( rab@@ bit ) over the maximum human@@ otherapeu@@ tic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ality , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and the can@@ ero@@ genous potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the medium steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites ranging from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the middle steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mid @-@ average steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane &apos;s efficacy was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had received anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine about three quarters . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 treated patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; if one considers only those patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drug efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who are breast @-@ feeding , nursing or prior to the treatment of low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel was and that it must not be given with other medicines in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ axel in order to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued its approval to the company Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union from Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast car@@ cin@@ oma in patients , in whom the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not displayed ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
&quot; in sens@@ oric neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 the treatment is to inter@@ rupt , until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ aired liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with reduced ren@@ al function were carried out and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to insufficient data on un@@ question@@ ability and effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ artic@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could exhibit significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again . &quot;
patients should not be re @-@ treated after treatment cycles until the sperm count increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ anes .
&quot; while a specific cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has been clearly identified with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not un@@ common , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if in patients after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ eal and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable method of contra@@ ction during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are recommended , during and up to six months after the treatment no child can testify . &quot;
male patients should be advised before treatment via a sperm @-@ preser@@ v@@ ative because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the traffic and the ability to serve machines . &quot;
listed below are the most common and most important events of side effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast car@@ cin@@ oma who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy appeared in each dose and indication ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;

&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules agent that fo@@ sters the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tube @-@ inde@@ xes and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their land@@ poly@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ it@@ oc@@ y@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dot@@ hel@@ i@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ inal recep@@ tors and due to the alb@@ um@@ inal protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast car@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two one @-@ armed non @-@ verbal studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received pac@@ lit@@ axel within 3 weeks with pac@@ lit@@ axel in the form of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion with no pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metasta@@ sis and 19 % because of metasta@@ sis and for adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 Results for general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients , who experienced a periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during the therapy . &quot;
the natural progression of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy for sub@@ stitution to bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
drug exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased in linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast car@@ cin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentrations decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ v@@ ascular distribution and / or soft band@@ aging of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel resulted in an IV 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of abra@@ sive pac@@ lit@@ axel with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after Abra@@ x@@ ane administration , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is first and foremost met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast car@@ cin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative secre@@ tion of the un@@ altered drug was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few dates are available to patients at the age of more than 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;

&quot; if using Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines Please inform the doctor if you apply other medicines or have been recently used , even if it is not prescription medicine , since these may potentially cause an interaction with abra@@ x@@ anes . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable method of contra@@ ction during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; in addition , they should be advised against the treatment of a sperm conservation , as the treatment of abrasion is the possibility of permanent in@@ fertility . &quot;
&quot; abrasion resistance and abrasion of machines Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the traffic and the ability to serve machines . &quot;

member states must ensure that the holder of permission to market the medical specialist in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials is provided for :
&quot; • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packing inserts . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference drug remedies &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron levels , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood circulation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases that the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or its super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
patients with chronic kidney failure or patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter at adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be monitored before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients , which suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they either were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also presented the results of a study , in which the effects of being spra@@ yed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were sustained in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , the patients who continued to obtain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally cause symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine @-@ like head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection among the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not cause allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Ab@@ se@@ amed has demonstrated evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union to the company Medi@@ ce Arzneimittel &amp; Co KG . &quot;

&quot; the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned major surgical interventions ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;

&quot; HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which can not take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program . &quot;
&quot; the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients in which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall illness ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ a exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the persistent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ a exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for the check of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially low H@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially low H@@ b ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with an increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall illness ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for controlling an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ a desc@@ ended &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te figure &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , and the response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood cann@@ ed is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( Day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , injec@@ tions can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking salt solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medication in the circulation . &quot;
patients suffering from a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etic retin@@ opathy ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia ( PR@@ CA ) should not receive any Ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in patients suffering from an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , v@@ ascular disease of carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti@@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a decrease in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be investigated and the common causes of non@@ response ( iron , fol@@ dy or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) should be investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value is low , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the &quot; &quot; Re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason of a loss of action is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies are determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be weigh@@ ed for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 . &quot;
in clinical trials an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits derived from epo@@ et@@ ins if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required for controlling the an@@ emia symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in intake should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically safe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
tumour patients under chemotherapy should consider a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etic response ( patients who need to be trans@@ coded ) .
&quot; if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 in order to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a value @-@ risk assessment , taking into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; for patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should have adequate th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic pro@@ phyla@@ xis as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and v@@ ascular diseases especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output bas@@ eline of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / v@@ ascular events can pers@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival for tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; if Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose is adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF on hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
&quot; about th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al ir@@ is , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal ar@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , retinal ar@@ thro@@ po@@ genic treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , were reported . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it is possible for surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and v@@ ascular complications . &quot;
the gene@@ tically derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ eri@@ zed and is identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ st@@ ants ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin lymph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 mam@@ mal car@@ cin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 22 prostate car@@ cin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal car@@ cin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;

survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and progression . progression
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin were consistent with an@@ a@@ emia due to several more common mal@@ ign@@ om@@ ous patients , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than in controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and with controls satisfactory .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s ser@@ um levels are much lower than the ser@@ um levels , which are reached after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well known comp@@ lication of chronic kidney failure in humans and may be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 . in animal experimental studies with approximately the 20@@ times of the recommended daily dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has led to reduced fat body weight , a delay in the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in f@@ ö@@ t@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; prior to market launch and agreement with the relevant authorities of the member states , the holder of approval for the market has to provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • A summary of the characteristics of the product ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 has been set up and functioning in the 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the marketing application , before the drug is applied to traffic and as long as it is used in the traffic . &quot;

&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for human use , an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the harm@@ fulness of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SUR ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • With the receipt of new information , the impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or measures for risk reduction could have occurred • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • following a call by the E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; • If you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , the risk of hem@@ or@@ rho@@ sis in veins ( deep ven@@ ous flowers ) occurs - if you have already performed such a blood type of blood in the veins ( for the first time ) . &quot;
&quot; they suffer from severe circulation distur@@ ban@@ ces of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( periph@@ eral arter@@ ial degeneration ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( v@@ ascular disease of the carot@@ id ) or brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , have recently had a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it may result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which is reflected in further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will conduct regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; lack of iron , dis@@ solution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before the treatment begins . &quot;
very rarely has been reported on the appearance of an anti @-@ body Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia according to months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( sub@@ cut@@ aneous ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or bar@@ ges by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic ren@@ al failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust the prescribed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of hem@@ or@@ rho@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ anical occurrence ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully over the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past there have been th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic v@@ ascular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis or lung em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; in case you are cancer patient , bear in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and , under certain circumstances , can adver@@ sely affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have been recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means for supp@@ ression of the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory investigations have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means for building the immune system , such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor may regularly arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , spread on two equal major injec@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg may be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor holds this appropriate for you , you can also learn how to spray Ab@@ se@@ amed herself under the skin . &quot;

ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y means that no more red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Speci@@ fic caution when applying Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
&quot; after repeated blood donations , it can come - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - a hem@@ or@@ rho@@ sis formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic v@@ ascular events ) . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of blood sample preparation after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic v@@ ascular events ) if your output level is too high

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause as well as in men .
&quot; it is used in patients suffering from a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a low traum@@ atic hip frac@@ tures ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first inf@@ usion , or through injection into one muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days following inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; in order to treat the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , A@@ cl@@ asta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ tures ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
&quot; in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta has been tested in two trials involving 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate for six months ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme , the bone substance ab@@ rup@@ ts ) in the blood re @-@ norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to those in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatments ) with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients suffering from A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ tures ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients with plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after the inf@@ usion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta must not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to cy@@ ani@@ onic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of ren@@ al complaints , reactions to the inf@@ usion point and oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta prepar@@ es recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

&quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The package insert • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and nursing women • Re@@ quired indication and symptoms for serious side effects • When looking back to medical or nursing help , &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ tures , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ tures ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after a treatment by the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ tures , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
patients with kidney impair@@ ment ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is available .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elderly patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and young people A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 , as data is missing for un@@ objec@@ tivity and effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta by sufficient calcium and vitamin D intake ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of cy@@ ani@@ onic acid on bone structure , temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia occurs , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; for patients who need dental interventions , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of any patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of severe side effect reported cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased in patients receiving A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with kidney function disorders associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted ren@@ al function were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis more than three years comparable to the asta@@ sia and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after application was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip fra@@ cture and in the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ tures , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of cy@@ ani@@ onic acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area has been reported especially in cancer patients , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the oral area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including cy@@ ani@@ onic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports refers to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental sur@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 7 study involving 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area with one with A@@ cl@@ asta and with a plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patient . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by using oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years , with either a bone dens@@ ity@@ - ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ dog ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ rate fra@@ cture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric spinal frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the incidence of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduction in verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with plac@@ ebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the donation neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis in 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients , treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , were taken from the pel@@ vis a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies . &quot;
a micro@@ computer @-@ tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone structure .
bone turnover marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) - the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um .
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ asta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the inf@@ usion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
the effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study increased A@@ cl@@ asta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D at total sc@@ ents and but@@ ler neck at all times .
&quot; in comparison with plac@@ ebo , A@@ cl@@ asta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total assets and 4.3 % of the don@@ key . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON RA@@ FT study 508 men were random@@ ized , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once yearly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline value .
&quot; clinical efficacy of treatment in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ asta has been studied in patients and patients aged more than 30 years with radi@@ ology ( mean ser@@ um levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase , corresponding to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.2 times age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg centr@@ onic acid compared with the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence was observed in comparison to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ e@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as respon@@ ders at the end of the six month main study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate participated in the follow @-@ up study , compared to 71 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , compared to 71 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , during a mean period of follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; 5 and 15 minute inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg cy@@ ani@@ onic acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be a dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that the plasma levels rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long continuous phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ ic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a termin@@ ale elimination of elim@@ inations t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early partial phases ( α and β with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in urine , while the remain@@ der is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; total body clearance is 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
&quot; a decreased clearance from cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely , because cy@@ to@@ chrome acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by humans and because they are a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an even kidney function error down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the an@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
&quot; as for severe kidney impair@@ ment ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements can be made for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest rated intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C were the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; in dogs became a 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals , 6 times a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds ) , well tolerated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that sufficiently exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common infection in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hy@@ sis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
at rats one observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced ser@@ um calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , supple@@ mented on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is in force and works before and during the product . &quot;
&quot; the risk management plan The owner of approval for the vehicle is obliged to carry out the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , which are presented in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the adopted version 004 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all the following by the CH@@ MP approved versions of the R@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ del@@ ine for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is disclosed that could affect the current information on safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the Pa@@ get , the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta counter@@ acts by restor@@ ing the bone structure again , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you have taken / apply other medicines or have recently been taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , of which it is known to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ asta along with food and drink , you are worried that you take sufficient liquid before your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is administered by your doctor or the nursing staff as inf@@ usion to a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fraction . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion to a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ cl@@ asta works for a long time , you may need to take another dose after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after inf@@ usion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can work more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before ending treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , if you consider stopping the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please contact your next doctor &apos;s min and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent following the subsequent inf@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is not clear whether A@@ cl@@ asta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you got A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired you or you may notice side effects that are not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ tures are recommended to perform the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ tures .
before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of cy@@ ani@@ onic acid on bone structure , temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ tures , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which are obes@@ e ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and additionally one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted to more than 7 000 patients , in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent to hi@@ ring the smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , studies on the setting of smoking showed no consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia reported during the trials ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and among other things can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , or iso@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that A@@ comp@@ lia &apos;s effectiveness with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight sever@@ ity
&quot; medicines used in patients that require health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which exhibit one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ de@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the use of treatment is out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who - besides obesity - do not exhibit disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble risks , de@@ pressed reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other closest persons ) must point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice when these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been adequately shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke ) less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

patients with over@@ weight patients as well as patients with obesity have been studied and in addition to 38@@ 00 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the unwanted effects in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and due to metabolic disorders .
if the incidence of statisti@@ cally significant was significantly higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for unwanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse events &lt; 1 % ) . NG In the evaluation of side effects the following common frequencies are found :
&quot; common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; common ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
only slight symptoms have been observed in a toler@@ able study in which a limited number of people were dispos@@ able of up to 300 mg .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ de@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.4 ; -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight loss was between A@@ comp@@ lia and plac@@ ebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,4 , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
9 weight reduction and further risk factors in the studies in patients with no diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average waste of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des of 6.@@ 9 % was seen ( tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.8 % . &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in plac@@ ebo &quot;
the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant Group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; the difference between the average weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . LN &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients taking Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . &quot;
the Ste@@ ady State plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ max = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ t@@ rough = 9@@ 1.6 ± 14.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) .

patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ max and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis ( age spectrum 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary data on the safety of the following adverse events which were not observed in clinical trials , which occurred in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic field , were considered possibly relevant for the clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress seems to be related to the handling of animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or men@@ stru@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and using lac@@ tation had no changes in learning behavior or memory .

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR to the public This document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations about the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sulph@@ onic acid or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin , in addition , they received either ac@@ or or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels in doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy trial , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional intraven@@ ous plac@@ ebo was reduced to 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 289 patients , patients who took acet@@ ate in addition to insulin showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with ac@@ tos were vision disorders , upper respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ vi@@ an@@ esia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who are sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ ones - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the inscription &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; no data is available for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , so the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study conducted with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ v@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output liver disease values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes are re @-@ controlled as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ ch complaints , fatigue , loss of appetite , and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued until the laboratory parameters are prec@@ eded by the clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be ag@@ itated by fatty deposits and in some cases related to fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction in the medium hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral dual or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin or as two @-@ phase combination therapy with insulin , is the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch was reported under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , if patients are reporting disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; an appropriate ophthal@@ m@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 fra@@ cture for 100 patients years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the interactions of interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the sensitivity of hyper@@ insulin and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic rate for the fo@@ al growth .
&quot; very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estim@@ able from present data ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens as they are observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege on three times the upper limit of the normal range also frequently appeared as plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ v@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one respectively . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch has rarely been reported about heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , however more frequently if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of messages of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies conducted over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occ@@ ured . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to have activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) activated by activation of specific core recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ ic@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscles . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ aging in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued for two years to investigate the time to post the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ de@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient , despite three months of optim@@ ising insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients receiving only insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
in clinical studies over a year under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent showed in comparison with the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small examination of type 2 diabetes .
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slight but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma levels and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d decreased values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ v@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness is equivalent to the triple of the efficacy of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , it has been proven that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lo@@ wers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period of imm@@ utable pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clear@@ ances of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys occurred after repeated administration of plasma volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and re@@ versi@@ bly ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the sensitivity of hyper@@ insulin and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic rate for the fo@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of the famili@@ al aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a led to an increased incidence of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 fra@@ cture for 100 patients years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
in another study more than two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pic@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were investigated .
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent was observed in comparison with the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study missed the target with regard to their primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation of the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation and vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with the intake of pic@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summari@@ zing analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative medi@@ ation showed an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is usually applied once or twice a day when a quick initial action together with a longer lasting effect is desired .

&quot; ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to utilize insulin effectively . &quot;
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks .
&quot; Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced similarly to another human insulin . &quot;
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be removed from the packing inserts ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes are out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the implementation of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day when a quick initial action together with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injec@@ tions needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy can change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi @-@ phase , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;

this document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations about the application of the drug .
&quot; the active ingredient in ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced with the method of so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; : &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu © E@@ MEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged How was Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id studied ?
ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
October 2002 the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
&quot; when two kinds of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin that is rapidly occurring must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin that has been acting . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before traveling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician since such journeys may lead to that insulin and meals have to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General diseases and dis@@ comfort at the place of delivery - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ om at the injection point ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason di@@ abe@@ tics should always have grape skins , sweets , bis@@ cu@@ its or sug@@ ary fruit juice . &quot;

&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum of action is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire operation duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
&quot; the data are limited , but suggest that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults . &quot;
&quot; inf@@ usion systems with ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0,@@ 05 I.@@ E. / ml - 1,0 I.@@ E. / ml insulin chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D- glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l of potassium chlori@@ de are stable for 24 hours when using inf@@ usion @-@ bags made of poly@@ propylene . &quot;
&quot; 11 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before traveling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician since such journeys may lead to that insulin and meals have to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; during insulin therapy local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ om can occur at the injection point ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason di@@ abe@@ tics should always have grape skins , sweets , bis@@ cu@@ its or sug@@ ary fruit juice . &quot;

&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared one year to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in one dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in one dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients , who once daily took 120 mg , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients in the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diarr@@ hea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with heart complaints in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or current g@@ out node and / or a g@@ out arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences with children and young people , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or un@@ compens@@ ated heart failure treatment is not recommended with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other res@@ inous medicinal products , it can come to an acute g@@ out attack during the treatment , because the reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ dening furnace first can mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ on syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during the phase 3 clinical trials , minor ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in the patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function test prior to the start of the first @-@ month treatment and in further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was no interaction studies conducted on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a inhibit@@ ing of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line metabol@@ isation was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous addition of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily associated with an increase of Feb@@ ux@@ o exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dosage adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient at the same time .
&quot; in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C of D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous capture of an ant@@ acid , magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed termin@@ ations do not let on side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to close pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not let direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when dealing with a vehicle , serving machinery , or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably safe that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by Prü@@ fer was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors found in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensation con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that were reported in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once were listed below . &quot;
diarr@@ hea , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ chic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events related to long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ot@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once , and occurred in patients who received the Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patients years ) , according to the statements occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or at a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ li@@ pi@@ de@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , show@@ y EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness , skin disc@@ ol@@ oration , skin irrit@@ ation , skin disc@@ ol@@ oration , skin irrit@@ ation , inflammation of the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
the effect mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises in the context of the reaction cas@@ cade of Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is an effective non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro inhi@@ bit below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
&quot; the efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients , in which the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels were &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer value at the start of the study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the A@@ PE@@ X study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol / # p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 versus 80 mg
the lowering of the ser@@ um sa@@ w@@ mill on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and kept permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The A@@ PE@@ X study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( D. h .
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline of the ser@@ um res@@ ins in subjects regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data from phase 3 collected in two years showed that the permanent reduction of ser@@ um acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. , more than 97 % of patients do not require any treatment against a stroke ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the number of g@@ out no@@ des , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out no@@ des to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ l / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at by administration of simple and multi@@ pler cans of 10 mg to 120 mg dose . &quot;
doses between 120 mg and 300 mg are observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.1 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentration was observed , if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma cutting of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary bin@@ dings to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ sta glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is created mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in urine as un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the mean total AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe ni@@ b@@ tial function .
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication A ) altered the C@@ max and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes observed regarding AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transi@@ tional cell pap@@ ill@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with x@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of specific pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
&quot; in high doses , which were about 4,@@ 3 times of human@@ otherapeu@@ tic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which was accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a development delay in the offspring of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions involving about 4,@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times of human therapeutic exposure , did not result in ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;
Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dosage adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient at the same time .
diarr@@ hea , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ chic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients , in which the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels were &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the data from phase 3 collected in two years showed that the permanent reduction of ser@@ um acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. , more than 97 % of patients do not require any treatment against a stroke ) . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , the well known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) liver function restriction changed the C@@ max and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .

some people accum@@ ulate the ur@@ ic acid in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble .
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC low , the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way with time a reduction of dis@@ comfort is achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid an irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 may already be used separately in drugs approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data that show that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose , which is required to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pains of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( intestinal disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( hi@@ cc@@ ups ) , de@@ fer@@ ous abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) , as well as acid re@@ cl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union for the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can only be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of recur@@ rent irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • Dur@@ ing the day , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only with special care ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms referring to possible mal@@ oc@@ cl@@ usal reactions , and patients should be advised to consult the medicine during symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worse feeling of heart@@ burn ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was found , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a were rarely reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ on@@ sis of the jaw , commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy is predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the risk of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients , which require a s@@ late surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take the tablet in the next morning after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the intended day of the week . &quot;
other diseases that affect mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other drugs ( see Section 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without having clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not have any indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy that can detect embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
&quot; the jaw &apos;s oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports are from cancer patients , but it has also been reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis research . &quot;
&quot; however , the ser@@ um calcium levels increased to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;

&quot; the main action of 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine vitamin D3 is the increase in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al az@@ ie may lead to an increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate The therapeutic equality of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the fra@@ cture @-@ intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in the phase III studies , the average growth of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is 10 mg / day in relation to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients suffering one or more verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of verteb@@ ral and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained . &quot;
&quot; it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , with which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least one new verteb@@ rate fra@@ cture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
&quot; absorption refers to an intraven@@ ous reference dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate for women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg following ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before receiving a standardis@@ ed breakfast . &quot;
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) resulted in no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats revealed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found again . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 m@@ l. / min and the systemic clear@@ ances exceeded 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is affected by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the com@@ partments after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics of patients Pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is ex@@ cre@@ ted quickly via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although there are no clinical data on this , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
therefore in patients with reduced ren@@ al function a slightly elevated cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is to be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

&quot; message : Hello , I was looking at rock @-@ gear.de today and found something that might be interesting for you . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or super@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; following a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adap@@ tations need to be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of the article should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; ) .
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to the article , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels should be checked before switching and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a tal@@ low level , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under the law to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ cycle phase .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with a low clearance , an adjustment of the S@@ agra@@ f can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
if the condition of the patient in the first post @-@ operative phase does not permit oral consumption of drugs the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca .
&quot; for the duration of the application to supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy may not be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advoc@@ acy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily donation in the morning .
further dose adap@@ tations can later be necessary as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics may change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advoc@@ acy should start with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily donation in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - change from Pro@@ gra@@ f to a daily intake of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to be converted from twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to one once daily intake of the article , so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , in relation to the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to the article once a day the treatment with the recommended oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection is necessary .
transplan@@ tation of adult patients who are converted to the article is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily .
&quot; other transplan@@ ts , although there is no clinical experience with the exception of lung , pancre@@ atic and intestinal transplan@@ t patients , in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal gra@@ ft recipients , patients in an oral initi@@ ating dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day were used . &quot;
&quot; dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders . &quot;
&quot; since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , patients with reduced kidney function can assume that dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ulin levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to the transition from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case , using full bl@@ ut tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level control controls . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; the blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to the article , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time using substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorou@@ gh@@ ness concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since adv@@ ent is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State interven@@ ed . &quot;
the data in clinical trials can be concluded that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the water level in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirrors in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under or over exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation of the article . &quot;
&quot; for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recep@@ tors in the child age , there are no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation of the article . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscle levels in the blood and weak@@ ening the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing car@@ ob ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided during treatment with the article ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , ocular or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under the article . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered states of consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; as adv@@ ent hard capsules , retar@@ ded , lac@@ tose are contained in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption particularly caution . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , thus increasing or lowering the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
therefore it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels at the same time gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dosage accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with anti @-@ fung@@ i such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the mac@@ ro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal inflammation .
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s metabolism on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tives and thereby increase hormone exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious in decisions about contra@@ cep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend its half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that in comparison with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ calibration of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the sub@@ strate profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How well known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is common in patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
&quot; cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with the article . &quot;
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors combined with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us cannot be di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction due to the T @-@ cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain range of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on the T cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ inter@@ fer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 receptor . &quot;
12 confirmed cases within the first 24 weeks were 32.@@ 6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 234 ) 29.@@ 3 % within the first 24 weeks .

&quot; the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( article C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Adv@@ ant@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; there were 3 ( men ) , in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) deaths . &quot;
&quot; published results of the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules two times a day after other primary organ transplan@@ tations , Pro@@ gra@@ f has become a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; 175 patients transplan@@ ted patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who had under@@ gone a pancre@@ as transplan@@ tation and in 630 cases were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 630 cases . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies revealed the observations in the large trials in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported to over 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us came in 21.@@ 7 % of cases to develop a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were killed by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the treatment of transplan@@ t patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a multic@@ enter study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients , who simultaneously treated a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized procedure tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and afterwards became the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centr@@ ic study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ts showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to a mirror between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently gra@@ ft ir@@ radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ ation and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of the metabolism of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that before ex@@ cre@@ tion , tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place mainly via the bil@@ e . &quot;
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was nearly 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients who were killed by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( once daily ) at a rate of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation of the article . &quot;

&quot; adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a deficiency of Factor VIII , con@@ genital blood cl@@ utter disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application is based on whether advoc@@ ates are used to treat ble@@ edings or prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; hem@@ ophi@@ lia A patients suffer from a Factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from a human plasma but produced according to a method known as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which em@@ powers it to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
&quot; adv@@ ate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but it is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the drug application was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ ti@@ des was awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the transfer of lawyers into the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment depend on the sever@@ ity of the Factor VIII deficiency , the place and the extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following ha@@ em@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII &apos;s activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the course of the treatment , the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions to control the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions is recommended . &quot;
&quot; in their response to factor VIII , individual patients can differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the Factor VIII is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the rate of administration should follow after receiving the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well known comp@@ lication in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VIII , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , recur@@ rence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , no experiences have been made on the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data not estim@@ able ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) .
the co@@ ag@@ ulation was maintained during all the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ rors in plasma and the clearing rate showed again enough values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE an 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
&quot; in addition , in any of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was observed after exposure to factor VIII ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients of a current clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms occ@@ ured to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes were reported in several repeated product tex@@ tures as part of the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reported over hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VIII is a factor factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .

&quot; based on the data available since initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a request of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , has decided that the authorisation holder should request another extension procedure in five years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the Committee on Human Use for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company res@@ um@@ ed its application for the application of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the tissue ( tissue that links other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) are affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that there can be no copies of themselves and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed by the not broken in the human body , is normally responsible for the recovery of damaged DNA and killing cells if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company submitted data from a study to a patient with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the lower abdom@@ en , bone and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company to the questions asked , some questions were still un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the submission of submitted documents , the CH@@ MP on day 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i could bring benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company is not aware of whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed active ingredient &quot; means that the tablets are set in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other is slowly released over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and older , the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ ol is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are eliminated . &quot;
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be tra@@ ced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main function dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms recorded by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all ha@@ y fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported a decrease in symptoms of 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a 37.@@ 4 % relief of the symptoms of 26.@@ 7 % compared to the patients who took L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are tach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardiac ch@@ ase ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( absence of appetite ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for treating allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should also not be used in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ angle glaucoma ( elevated ocular pressure ) , cardiac or v@@ ascular disease including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ( hyper@@ tension caused by cereb@@ ral stroke ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe initiative in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without sh@@ ear@@ ing , cr@@ ush or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the lack of data , aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age due to the lack of data for un@@ objec@@ tivity and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , since the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with time during long @-@ term applications . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can continue with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ li@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patients &apos; collective and the data are insufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data are not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that the treatment must be de@@ posed when a hyper@@ tension or a tach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a strengthening of the head@@ ache ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck reduction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to conducting der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines prevent otherwise positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions and can reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alter@@ ations of the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded . &quot;
in vitro studies have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , but experiences gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies could not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; as reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impair@@ ment of transport and ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible Latvian courses . &quot;
&quot; ache , anxiety , difficult mus@@ cular tension , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory heart failure , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , aspir@@ ation , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary soli@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
in a single dose study with adults des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further lik@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a tach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 were involved with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aero@@ bic tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine during the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aero@@ bic tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n during the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; according to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city , the efficacy of aero@@ bic tablets did not show any significant differences . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze for healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n badly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to intraven@@ ous aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ability toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its single components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in Modul 1.@@ 8.1 of the application of approval , pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and during the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of allergic symptoms , preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and dro@@ oping eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous drug of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot;

&quot; inform your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses with you under the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze : • blood pressure • heart ch@@ ase , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • nau@@ sea and head@@ ache , or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently been taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
transportation and handling of machines When applying in the recommended dosage is not to be reck@@ oned that aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or de@@ compos@@ es the attention .
&quot; if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze , you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ ze than you should . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot to take a dose of aer@@ os@@ ol If you have forgotten to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the designated time . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , severe allergic reactions ( breath , breathing , it@@ ching , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin r@@ ashes were reported . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach pains , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , depression , depression , depression , anxiety with increased physical activity , through cases of liver inflammation and about cases of eye @-@ catching liver disease , has also been very rarely reported . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies involving about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by examining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom highlights after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit for the establishment of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to rel@@ ieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is limited experience in clinical trials for the efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can be termin@@ ated after the symptoms of the symptoms and res@@ um@@ ed again .
in the per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy time .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not reinforced while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which may lead to impair@@ ment of transport and ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us per day than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 juven@@ ile patients aged 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
&quot; this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular activity was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
in a single dose study with adults des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and itch@@ iness of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated on the basis of the overall survival of the questionna@@ ire for life of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms , and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; as the history of hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all age @-@ related diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is also leading to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s were comparable , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ clinical studies carried out with L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ability toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; colour@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ aller@@ genic titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ ellose , mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to rel@@ ieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis . &quot;
&quot; approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabol@@ ising des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , experiencing a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metabol@@ ised , is identical to that of children , which met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ cro@@ se is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency may not use this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents who were administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years of age who had a question of anti@@ hist@@ amine were given a daily dose of 1.25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular activity was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; during an individual daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young people in clinical trials led to no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or system . &quot;
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults it was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced power loss nor an increase in dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol .
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and itch@@ iness of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionna@@ ire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish those caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; the spread of this fully metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are fully metabol@@ ised .
the load ( AU@@ C ) through des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max approx . 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant substance accumulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 in various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients with the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a 5 mg dosage .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III bra@@ zing bottles with child @-@ sure poly@@ propylene inter@@ locking cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ ystyrene measuring spo@@ on , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application injection for taking with scales of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
&quot; take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at once a day , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dosage of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated and documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular activity was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed . &quot;
in a 17 single dose study with adults des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and itch@@ iness of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;

&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the Sir@@ up@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile established by adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be bi@@ valent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at to form@@ ulate a des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n formulation . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clinical study was observed . &quot;
in a single dose study with adults des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
&quot; the dis@@ sem@@ ination of this poor@@ ly metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , however , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for inser@@ tion the form@@ ulations were bi@@ valent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets have not been studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose studies in children , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;
&quot; food has no significant influence on AU@@ C and C@@ max of A@@ eri@@ us A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at , while food T@@ max is extended from 2.5 to 4 hours and T@@ max from 3 @-@ OH@@ - des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n from 4 to 6 hours . &quot;
the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting tablets revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical applications .

an A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg melt tablet once daily put in your mouth to rel@@ ieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg dose tablet proved to be bi@@ valent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at to form@@ ulate a des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n formulation . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular activity was described . &quot;
in a 30 single dose study with adults des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and itch@@ iness of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for inser@@ tion the form@@ ulations were bi@@ valent .
the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting tablets revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical applications .
&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metabol@@ ised , is identical to that of children , which met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ cro@@ se is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n Group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; for children between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more often than plac@@ ebo were diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 at a single dose of 2.5 mg . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended dos@@ ages , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may vary depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s as measured by the overall results of the questionna@@ ire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis .
&quot; the spread of this fully metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ eri@@ us contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio @-@ equi@@ val@@ ence study was required and it is expected that it comp@@ lies with the sy@@ rup and tablets . &quot;
&quot; in various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company res@@ um@@ ed its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a trunk of the flu virus which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic occurs when a new tribe of the flu virus occurs , which can easily spread from man to man because people have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; following administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is later able to form antibodies in a contact with a flu virus virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that det@@ ects the human body as a foreign body ) was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the extent of the clinical data base for the assessment of the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are participating in a clinical examination and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) that causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generic is available as a solution for induc@@ ing , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination was not studied . &quot;
&quot; it should be prescribed only if the doctor has checked , which anti @-@ viral drug the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood that the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines are taken . &quot;
&quot; in children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of am@@ per@@ ase is directed to the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gen@@ ase reduces the HIV virus in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS cannot cure , however , can delay damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; am@@ per@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ generic ase was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 206 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after the treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load among 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo after 48 weeks , but A@@ was@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ was@@ ase also decreased the viral load , but with the children who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults , who previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the vir@@ us@@ load enhanced by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r after 16 @-@ week treatment was just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came to a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ val@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase should not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal preparation for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are broken down just like a@@ gen@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , in patients who are taking am@@ ass@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ phy ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the restor@@ ative immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of am@@ per@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years were out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks .
&quot; am@@ per@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of am@@ per@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; only limited information was required at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for the transport of am@@ ass@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , as@@ gener@@ ase is indicated for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; generally , A@@ generic capsules are intended to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than the capsule ; hence , A@@ generic capsules and solution for induc@@ ing on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic capsules are used without the addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of am@@ per@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ un@@ ase combined with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; am@@ per@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of am@@ per@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
am@@ per@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ idal 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing car@@ ob ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a decreased therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tioned that am@@ per@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with am@@ per@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for general , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver re@@ percus@@ sions with potentially fatal course .
&quot; in case of an un@@ timely anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre@@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the metabol@@ isation of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ entu@@ ated R@@ atio ) , are available methods for determining the concentrations of active substance . &quot;
patients who take this medicine at the same time may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ental symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity because of the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ generic solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; am@@ per@@ ase should be removed in the duration of 5 , when a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the presence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many patients had other illnesses related to their therapy which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; at h@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) , who were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ o@@ thro@@ sis occur . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is accepted ( including using cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width can not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ idal 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width as@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines which are mainly metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in trying to compensate for the reduced plasma levels by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects were observed on the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um mirror of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already occup@@ ies St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ ar mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s Wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ max , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , demonstrating the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
52 % reduced when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached twice a day with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a tight monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and un@@ objec@@ tivity of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study to use as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the anta@@ ci@@ zed component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , the in@@ comes of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and a@@ gen@@ ase should be at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dose adjustment is required . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would er@@ ase .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as exact predic@@ tions of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase of side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ un@@ ase it is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of con@@ current administration .
simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients should be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with a@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as am@@ per@@ ase , as it may come to res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme c@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@
&quot; simultaneous intake of am@@ per@@ ase can increase its plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous addition of as@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ides , unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time . &quot;
&quot; since plasma cutting increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; there is recommended a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of mirrors , as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while at the same time it is advisable with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible rise in the plasma levels from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ental symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the slight neg@@ ligence of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation as to how the am@@ pren@@ ose dose is to be adjusted when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous injection of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ entu@@ ated R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous use of am@@ per@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exceeds the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ pple in the uter@@ us to the end of the still time Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase in 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the further development of the offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most adverse events associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment demo@@ lition . &quot;
&quot; many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the intake of am@@ per@@ ase or any other medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of am@@ per@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were assessed by the investig@@ ators as related to study medication and recorded in more than 1 % of patients , as well as in the treatment of any laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fet@@ al fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral antibodies that were treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din for a mean period of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ckers ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study there were 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for a mean period of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or lean @-@ pap@@ il@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontane@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment being canc@@ eled with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ nec@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of initi@@ ation of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of am@@ ass@@ ase twice a day with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients who received am@@ per@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral and ga@@ g pol@@ - poly@@ protein@@ ases with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ am concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were observed - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r sta@@ ined regim@@ en with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .
&quot; with six@@ teen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not treated patients who received 700@@ mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be studied gen@@ otyp@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 entr@@ en@@ ched patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M &quot;
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : N = 107 ) patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks with the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests can be applied to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ zing the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not treated patients , in which a F@@ os@@ amp@@ er avi@@ r ( one of these isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , to invo@@ ke sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the maintenance of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; early canc@@ elation of a so@@ othing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can affect the subsequent treatment . &quot;
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study involving PI pre @-@ treated adults according to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( virus load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) either with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; sto@@ cked &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub@@ ority of AP@@ V / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ sub@@ li@@ ves@@ haft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged between 2 and 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generic solution was used twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline value . &quot;
19 Based on these data should be considered during therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; immort@@ al &quot; as@@ un@@ ction .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ MAX ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ max , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of absorption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active constitu@@ ent fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines which in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or present a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be given with caution when given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ ar exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available from the solution than from capsules ; hence , A@@ generic solution and am@@ per@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the impact of kidney impair@@ ment on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may be small . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy subjects according to a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous delivery of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on can@@ di@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats observed in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas with dos@@ ages , which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , there were little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and verified in everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of am@@ per@@ ase after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of juven@@ iles treated as of an age of 4 days showed high mort@@ ality , both in the control animals and with the animals being treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in systemic plastic exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic capsules are used without the addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of am@@ per@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use should be performed in patients with weak or mild liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ entu@@ ated R@@ atio ) , are available methods for determining the concentrations of active substance . &quot;
&quot; am@@ per@@ ase should be stopped in the duration of 27 when a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ max , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached twice a day with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a tight monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and un@@ objec@@ tivity of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would er@@ ase .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as exact predic@@ tions of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ un@@ ase it is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 although there are no clinical data available .

&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous injection of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ entu@@ ated R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ pple in the uter@@ us to the end of the still time Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the maintenance of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , therapy optimisation should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; immort@@ al &quot; &quot; a@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active constitu@@ ent fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines which in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or present a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be given with caution when given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of kidney impair@@ ment should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on can@@ di@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ytes of aden@@ o@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in dos@@ ages , which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele Aden@@ omas and Car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , there were little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of juven@@ iles treated as of an age of 4 days showed high mort@@ ality , both in the control animals and with the animals being treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in k@@ itt@@ ens the met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation paths are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . ) &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic drugs can be used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; B@@ oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; &quot; A@@ generic solution for intake was neither covered with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than the capsule ; hence , A@@ generic capsules and solution for induc@@ ing on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a maximum daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; additionally , as no dosage recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of A@@ generic solution for low dose and low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination with these patient groups can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ generic solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ co@@ carbon content , A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of metabolism of this medicine and potentially provo@@ ke severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as arr@@ hyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be cau@@ tioned that am@@ per@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with am@@ per@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ entu@@ ated R@@ atio ) , are available methods for determining the concentrations of active substance . &quot;
am@@ per@@ ase should be stopped for duration when a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; at h@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) , who were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ o@@ thro@@ sis occur . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ max , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake of am@@ per@@ ase can increase its plasma concentrations and lead with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ es , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ generic drugs may not be used during pregnancy because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exceeds the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ pple in the uter@@ us to the end of the still time Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase in 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the intake of am@@ per@@ ase or any other medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were observed - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r sta@@ ined regim@@ en with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .
early canc@@ elation of a sa@@ wing 60 treatment is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits which can affect the subsequent treatment .
62 Based on these data should be considered during therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; immort@@ al &quot; as@@ un@@ ction .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large v@@ eto@@ sis volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .

&quot; your doctor will normally advise you to apply am@@ per@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , to enhance the effect of am@@ per@@ ase . &quot;
the use of am@@ per@@ ase will be based on your individual viral resistance test and your treatment history .

&quot; other ingredients are Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col 400 ( Polye@@ th@@ ylene gly@@ col 400 ) , To@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( TP@@ GS ) , Ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am @-@ potassium , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of small cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream is up to a maximum of 16 weeks a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is th@@ inn@@ ed to apply to the affected skin areas so that it will remain sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before being washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the agent ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo had a daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks .
&quot; • In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phic ker@@ at@@ osis ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) apply before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible fl@@ are in the genital or per@@ ic@@ anal area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
&quot; an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammation @-@ reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) , or if an infection is observed in the treatment area . &quot;
&quot; if in the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should begin ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient was able to apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Creme is applied in a thin layer and puri@@ fied in the cleaned skin area , until the cream is fully drawn into . &quot;
it should take place among these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients weighing between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ yst@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe plague were observed and one case with one for circumc@@ ision is observed . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme , immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous use means for the treatment of external ti@@ lt in the genital and per@@ ic@@ ular area , no clinical experience has been observed so far . &quot;
&quot; although limited data indicate increased rate of ti@@ lt reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Creme has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group in relation to the removal of the ti@@ lt war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair approach has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be judged after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ sti@@ tial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experience is present , therefore the use of previously untreated tum@@ ours is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower lik@@ eli@@ hood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support effectiveness in this purpose , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally decrease in the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons reported a lower healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ o @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme should be applied with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not have direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , degeneration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ one or several top@@ ical application of quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) has been achieved , no recommendation can be given during lac@@ tation . &quot;
the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of ti@@ lt ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
the most commonly reported and reported as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme in related side effects include dis@@ comfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the BC@@ Cs treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; in these studies , the most common , as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme in the context were a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) . &quot;
side effects reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ c ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; according to the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan , these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Creme often came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) , ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the clinical evidence , according to the test plan , it shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe screening and c@@ abling ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dental one @-@ off or@@ ale absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 sach@@ ets , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg occurred , was in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 3 @-@ phase @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies , it was possible to demonstrate that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of the ti@@ lt during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment was clearly superior during 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; in 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients , the F@@ eig@@ a@@ ws were completely healed ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
a total healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 men treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s effectiveness in five @-@ colour use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fici@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s effectiveness at three times weekly application in one or two treatment intervals of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ tics , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phic AC@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the untreated scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the first @-@ year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications extern@@ ally war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ische ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ sti@@ tious bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks res@@ p . ) .
a minimal systemic intake of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed at three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s res@@ or@@ ption was low in patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ sti@@ tial cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study conducted for the der@@ mal application for four months showed no similar effects on the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ors at the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ated , a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UV@@ R . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people , even if these same symptoms do as you . − If one of the side effects you have significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect in the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , back pain , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion point . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , tach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who are hyper@@ sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) . &quot;
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and if necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will monitor patients who receive al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me with respect to the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ er@@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this every 15 minutes in single steps at a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect occurring during inf@@ usion or up to the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an adequate clinical environment , in which rein@@ forcement facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience exists concerning res@@ um@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , it must be cau@@ tious due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after the treatment has been interrupted . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before the beginning of the inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ py@@ c@@ ents ) to minimize the potential incidence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or medium @-@ severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
the inf@@ usion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate at which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the pre@@ determined reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to larv@@ ae about breast milk , it is recommended not to satisfy al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me during treatment . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants less than 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase III study and their extension with 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ s and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children adverse drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged less than 5 years , with mainly severe or@@ atory form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
most patients received a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the treatment was started ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days with patients at the age of 5 years and over ) .
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 trial ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , there were no antibodies in 13 / 45 patients ( RI@@ P ) as@@ say , including 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of G@@ AG levels in urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was to be determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 trial and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro that did not impact clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation sufficient restoration of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me were evaluated in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the central phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the FE@@ V expected to be expected and the absolute path@@ way in the 6 minute walking test .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated the plac@@ ebo group to improve the lung function and the sal@@ v@@ ability shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as from the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically non @-@ significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased expon@@ enti@@ ally to the height of adults .
&quot; from the 26 patients with h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease of the G@@ AG levels was observed in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of hetero@@ geneous disease manifest@@ ations between patients , which were taken into account by using a combined end point , clin@@ ically significant changes were observed across five efficacy variables ( an expected percentage of 10 patients ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase @-@ 2 study was carried out in which the primary safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were evaluated in 20 patients ( 16 patients with severe course and 4 with medium toler@@ ances ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg during the last 26 weeks due to increased g@@ ag@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , investigations were carried out on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schemes on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute ga@@ it test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to elderly and less affected patients .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant cancer ) is likely to spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta ( a vitamin ) and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids should be given before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed or the dose is reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slo@@ ws the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide .
&quot; the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer service life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a primary study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin out@@ lived average 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ axel .
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer had not attacked the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta , indicated longer survival times than with the comparative drug . &quot;
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each punch bottle needs to be dissolved with 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is extracted from the flow of water and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with chronic advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the incidence and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken during the seven days before the first dose , and the intake must continue during the whole therapy duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients must also receive an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage as well as after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ G@@ PT ) and Alan@@ in @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination must take place taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood bil@@ e or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria are based on the definition of the Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ti@@ o- a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or - on the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above compared to patients at the age of 65 years there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on un@@ question@@ ability and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adap@@ tations were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which exceed the dose adjustments recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with liver function reduction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row supp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bel may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutral number of cells returns a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has once again achieved a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neutr@@ ality , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as seen in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ghtly @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was administered when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
therefore all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bel must be used to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to the therapy to avoid treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients en@@ vis@@ aged for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; many patients , in which these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accum@@ ulations in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the results should be induced prior to the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed when this substance was commonly given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of the reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is , men should be advised before the treatment g@@ inn to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation . &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ances ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) lead to a reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed elimination with the result of an increased incidence of side effects .
caution is advisable when treating high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in a high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy - be avoided on the day of treatment and minimum 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; as there is no data in relation to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy also require increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ entu@@ ated R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with more anti @-@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary - and after careful weighing of the use for the mother and the risk of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised to consult with regard to the blocking of the sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed moves into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and the random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed were random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
&quot; side effects Frequ@@ encies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10000 ) and not known ( based on the available data of spontan@@ ei@@ ty not estim@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; for this table , a 5 % threshold was set regarding the recording of all events where the reporting doctor held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bel and cis@@ pl@@ atin for possible . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC Tox@@ ic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed were covered with arr@@ hyth@@ mia and mot@@ oric neu@@ rop@@ athy .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 265 patients who were random@@ ized P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as mon@@ otherapy with gifts of fol@@ dy re and vitamin B@@ 12 as well as 276 patients who were random@@ ized doc@@ et@@ axel as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC Tox@@ ic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ised p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed were included sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as .
&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the summari@@ zed results of three single p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy studies , except neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to lead back to differences in the patient population since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could potentially be related to study medication ; they were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 830 patients with NSC@@ LC were random@@ ized to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was determined for the inclusion of all events in which the reporting doctor held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bel and cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
clinical relevant toxic@@ ity reported to ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( often ) of patients were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed :
clinical relevant toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed were included :
&quot; cereb@@ rov@@ ascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular det@@ achment and trans@@ it@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks have been reported occasionally in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance , occasionally reported . &quot;
&quot; from clinical trials , cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal cor@@ ro@@ sis , and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) were reported in patients suffering from diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , cases of mis@@ leading inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in patients suffering from recur@@ rent inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis . &quot;
it has been reported cases of acute ren@@ al failure in case of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy regim@@ ens ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were be@@ amed before or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that exercises its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important , fol@@ ly @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed works as anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the thym@@ us dy@@ l@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis by Thy@@ mid@@ in- and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin for chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural othel@@ i@@ oma showed that with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin , patients treated with cis@@ pl@@ atin were treated only with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clinical @-@ relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural syndrome in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) was shown to the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms have resulted in an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study involving A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC had a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA @-@ treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 . &quot;
&quot; limited data from a random@@ ized , controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the IT@@ T population analyses and support the non @-@ sub@@ tl@@ ety of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination opposite gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

&quot; it is used for obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and no weight loss after 12 weeks should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , resulting in a quarter of the fats associated with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed into the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo in 39@@ 1 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg during the intake of plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily sta@@ ins at after , Fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ h@@ lab@@ y , chair @-@ urge , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish of a ful@@ ler secre@@ tion ( rot ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; furthermore , it may not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; July 2007 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction in adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ted , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients • simultaneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic checks , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a physician or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic needs to be adapted if necessary . &quot;
patients who are all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ contrac@@ ting measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contra@@ cep@@ tions in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in a study on drug interactions , as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed . &quot;
&quot; when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ alized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a supplement of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; following the application of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentrations . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological action of the drug , since absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal adverse events were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( frequency based on available data not estim@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain magnitude . &quot;
+ It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety with regard to possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered three times daily over a period of 15 days on normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings occurred .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , there were either no side effects or similar side effects reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid rep@@ lication of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect works in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bon@@ ding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic lip@@ ases .
&quot; from clinical trials it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , has blocked absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , changing the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , has been evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average total cholesterol in the Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; in the waist measurement , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3,5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after or@@ ally administered or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , which was administered minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ al dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed lac@@ t@@ ine group ) , could be identified , which displayed approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentrations . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ di@@ ogen@@ ous potential and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ability toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot be identified as a threat to humans . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects are related to the effect of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , since at this time you may not have consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minim@@ ise nutritional benefits : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a low @-@ fat diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ eli@@ hood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
• Ke@@ ep out of the medicine for children . • Do not use any more than 25 ° C after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date stated on the box . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • diabetes
&quot; sustained weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find on food packaging . &quot;
keep in mind the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; in the information below , which amount is appropriate for you , refer to the amount of calories that is suitable for you . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by resp@@ ecting the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nutritional benefits . &quot;
&quot; 34 This decreased cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0,5 kg per week without fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot;
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to them .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of additional information materials that can help you feed calories and fat duc@@ ts and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; in conjunction with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; al@@ oh@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are an even trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects of this age group .
&quot; this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied in 1 842 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are regular trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit for the establishment of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with severe nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , due to cancer . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting which is induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
&quot; as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable in the simultaneous addition of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhibit@@ ors the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic drugs ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ on and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , D@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; the experience of the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the doctor treating . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ gram ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , were head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions by the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequency of adverse events such as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose approaches to observe .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for Alo@@ xi@@ an over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients received a quantit@@ atively em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 150@@ mg / m2 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 mc@@ g. pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron receiving 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously per day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with compar@@ atively em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion@@ ization and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0,25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration , an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ -@@ 90 μ / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
&quot; following intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentrations was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations showed that at once daily intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75@@ mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable with the value measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however the C@@ max was higher after a one @-@ off of 0.75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g. / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable drug made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous stu@@ d injection was 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although patients with severe liver function disorders are the terminal elimination bracket and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified by this . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures that are considered adequate over the maximum human@@ otherapeu@@ tic exposition , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only very high concentrations of ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the duration of action .
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which have been given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , hyp@@ ophy@@ sis , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is used in humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this approval must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the medicine approved as part of this decision .

June 2006 the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the approval of the medicine for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by the Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ onic should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in a microsc@@ opic examination the liver tissue damage causes damage , and also the values of the liver enzymes al@@ anine am@@ ines ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates it for the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon protected data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference doctor . &quot;
the study measured how many patients after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment were treated as well as 6 months after treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int
&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed to the extent that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be mark@@ eted does not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease increased again with more patients than with the reference doctor ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test conducted in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated to investigate the question of how far the drug is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection accompanied by cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ s ( crack or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ching wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this type of infections may not be effective .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the area to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was gone after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin cells , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar responses : if the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation to the order .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go at short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections were out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ ins , scrat@@ ches or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or serious local irrit@@ ation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is me@@ ticul@@ ously bl@@ ur@@ red and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections , in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as patho@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in patients infected with secondary infections , the efficacy of retin@@ as in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or degra@@ dation of the infected place after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ as and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ing in vi@@ vo is not expected in vi@@ vo due to the low plasma concentrations that have been reached by humans following top@@ ical application ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral treatment of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on dic@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary when top@@ ical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ es . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate with regard to a statement on impact on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to admini@@ ster systemic antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated , the benefit of breast@@ feeding is to be considered for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go reported was the most common side effect of irrit@@ ation at the location , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; Re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance produced by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis due to interaction at a specific binding point of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site contains ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P bin@@ dings and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
&quot; by binding at this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interaction and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some forms of infection appear question@@ able , a consultation by experts should be sought . &quot;
&quot; no differences were found in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ as compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of failure to respond to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of stra@@ ins with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
absorption In a study involving healthy adults 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on and applied to sec@@ lu@@ ded skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients prior to medi@@ ation and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the retin@@ as IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism in vitro @-@ oxid@@ ative metabol@@ isms in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with a low participation of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in studies of oral toxic@@ ity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

&quot; there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) scrat@@ ched skin : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats were observed in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ three @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development capacity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed sati@@ ety ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as in the 1.@@ 8.1 module of the application , is present and works before the product is mark@@ eted and as long as the product is mark@@ eted . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the Agency is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP which is agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;

ambient is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years of age which are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; ambient is applied as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ ent can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immun@@ isation process , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan exists from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , ambient or other hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ ent contains the same constitu@@ ents as the vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 , and the vaccine Twin@@ rix Children has been approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same disease , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because ambient and Twin@@ rix adult ingredients contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 month distance between the two injec@@ tions . &quot;
ambient assisted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ ent &apos;s degree of protection was similar to six and a 12 @-@ month distance between injec@@ tions .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ aches , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ iness ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambient may not be used in patients who are hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als a.@@ a. a permit for the transportation of Ambi@@ ent in the whole
&quot; the initial dose for pri@@ mers with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses , whereby the first dose is given at the time of the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refresh@@ ment is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines . &quot;
anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and Anti @-@ Hepatitis A Virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to a Hepatitis A vacc@@ ination may require a tro@@ phy as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no more det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , in the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the treatment of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination of the combination of hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody can be achieved in these cases , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be necessary . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ mal injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ lication , these injec@@ tions should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or co@@ ag@@ ulation distur@@ ban@@ ces , ambient conditions may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous , as it can occur in these cases after intr@@ amus@@ cular administration of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if ambient assisted in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ in@@ iness , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations in the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , Ambi@@ ent &apos;s toler@@ ability was compared with the combination of the 3 @-@ dose combination . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ iness on a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after Ambi@@ ent &apos;s dose of 5@@ 0.7 % of subjects compared to 39.@@ 1 % in subjects according to a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
&quot; after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ teen reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ing was compar@@ ably high per pro@@ vol@@ ution ( i.e. via the total vaccine cycle of 39.@@ 6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ ent compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ in@@ iness was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combined vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose regim@@ en .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; at the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , is not reported per pro@@ vol@@ ution . &quot;
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with ambient or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not different statisti@@ cally .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.1 % a month after the second dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; with the 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with ambient matrix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were reached in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose regim@@ en with ambient or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambient immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vaccine .
the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to those that after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) , or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , was administered to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing on possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; in accordance with Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state of charge is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transferred through other ways , such as by bathing in poll@@ uted waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ ent cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections caused by the liver or causing symptoms similar to those after hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
&quot; • If your child has shown an allergic reaction to ambient matrix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can be utter@@ ed by it@@ ching r@@ ashes , breathing difficulties or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to a former vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . &quot;
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vaccine dose ) .
&quot; at a potential risk of hepatitis B infection between first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with ambient matrix . &quot;
instead it will recommend to you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined Hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and will give you a vacc@@ ination protection against the end of the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes ambient conditions in people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots are inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / your body &apos;s immune system , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambient may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Tell your doctor if you / your child may take other medicines / intake ( including those that you can get without prescription ) , or if you have received / or your child has recently vacc@@ inated / has received / has or has been planned in the near future . &quot;
but it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine needs to be given simultaneously with ambient matrix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if ambient matrix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , ambient swelling or lac@@ t@@ ating women is not administered unless it is urgently needed to vacc@@ inate against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; other side effects that have been reported for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 fall per 10,000 contaminated doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or extended sur@@ charges that can be it@@ chy or bli@@ stering , swelling of the eye and face , complicated breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like symptoms , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ants running &quot; , Multiple sclerosis , disorders of the visual nerve , severe head@@ ache and sti@@ ff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;

&quot; 23 . inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the side effects you have / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you may notice side effects that are not stated in this packing inserts . &quot;
ambient is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data that have been known for distribution since the first approval for the market , CH@@ MP rec@@ alled that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix has been positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since ambient has only been brought to traffic in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the safety data available for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with an in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ial enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high am@@ mon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps - divided into several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered by a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo @-@ medication , i.e. without an active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ aps can also result in loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ain@@ ting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ y in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high am@@ mon@@ ia levels .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval there were limited information on this drug . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ arious form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ial enc@@ ephal@@ opathy exists . &quot;
&quot; for babies , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated according to the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight above 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients who suffer from an early @-@ manifest@@ ed lack of carb@@ amide phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ sy@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the formation of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium and ede@@ ma formation .
&quot; as metabolic and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred . &quot;
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients were at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ec@@ top@@ enia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old baby with a single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms begin with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity at intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , which is administered through acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early mani@@ folds form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st and the disease led even when treating per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ ues within the first year of life .
&quot; it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated prior to the first occurrence of hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ial enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a delayed form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ote form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated to glut@@ amine in liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ c@@ lic disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day of up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the morning after no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys within 24 hours of about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no cl@@ adi@@ c effects in the case of toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , which are not yet able to swal@@ low tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight above 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of am@@ mon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients who suffer from an early @-@ manifest@@ ed lack of carb@@ amide phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the p@@ yr@@ ami@@ ds of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ec@@ top@@ enia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
py@@ gab@@ ri@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess .
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram the recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after the intake of measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were observed . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spo@@ on contains 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spo@@ on 2.9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot separate the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products , which accum@@ ulate in the body after the consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if carried out in your laboratory examinations , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently been taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during the breast@@ feeding period , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , sensation distur@@ ban@@ ces , ob@@ struction of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ ban@@ ces and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , feel free to contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital in order to initiate appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the dose of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; blood pattern changes ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , loss of fluids , weight gain , and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you significantly affect or you may notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the re@@ board and the container after the exp@@ iry date .
&quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the em@@ bos@@ sing &quot; &quot; U@@ CY 500 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory studies are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently been taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS to take or@@ ally or@@ ally or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c th@@ ist@@ le ( hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is guided through the nose into the stomach ) .

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for instance in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ c@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of AC@@ S was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or one year altogether just as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who were subjected to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in with regard to all indicators except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox should not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ or , other mil@@ ines , or other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as with people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and while one PCI is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission issued the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ) inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency or early intervention .
the recommended dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous ros@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose may be res@@ um@@ ed from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous c@@ ision of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of an exclusive Bol@@ us @-@ Gabe from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shor@@ tened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be performed . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before application and the intake dose is administered promptly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate ren@@ al function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ valent ir@@ ines against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt over@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and check the ACT 5 minutes after the second intake dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , which were included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT @-@ value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• frequent hyper@@ tension against the active ingredient or other ingredients or against mil@@ k@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased risk of blood due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ o@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or ir@@ reversible nerve damage .
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if most hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages occur in the arter@@ ial points under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ entu@@ ated R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is once again achieved prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ greg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , these drugs may increase the risk of blood . &quot;
in any case the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ greg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants can be checked regularly .
&quot; animal experimental investigations are inadequate in relation to effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , degeneration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone . 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated ha@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to suffer from adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for heavy bleeding like in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following occur@@ ren@@ ces : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl without apparent bleeding point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood flow , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
&quot; the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine in 6000 patients , who are subjected to a PCI . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group as well as in the compar@@ isons treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following side effects that are not listed above were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organs classified in table 6 .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ valent ir@@ is is immediately termin@@ ated and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed to monitor signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ocular inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as on the ani@@ on @-@ bond region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is bound in the liquid phase or on cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spreading the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there were no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) induced by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , not to in@@ duce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed following a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be added and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated ha@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ho@@ stage inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or either before starting the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or with the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were ev@@ enly distributed over the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - alter@@ ations or increased cardi@@ al biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ gone within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients treated with perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din acts as a pep@@ tide into its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent recovery of the amino acids in the body pool .
&quot; the primary Met@@ abo@@ lit , resulting from the split of the Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ Termin@@ ale sequence through th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or as a permanent inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or does not process insulin effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means it works faster and has a shorter active duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body does not produce insulin in two studies with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults in type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot work effectively .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study involving type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin l@@ is@@ pro . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration decreased 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.30 % in human normal insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ul@@ is@@ ins , or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the abdominal belt . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can change the insulin requirement . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or termination of treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in dosage .
the timing of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the bias of hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation can be weak@@ ened under the effect of sympath@@ etic agents such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity showed no difference between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin is hyper@@ sensitive to human breast milk , but in general insulin is neither absorbed into breast milk nor is it res@@ or@@ alized after oral application . &quot;
&quot; occur@@ ren@@ ces listed in clinical trials are listed according to system organs and ordered by decre@@ asing frequency of their occurrence ( very frequent : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rarely known ( frequency based on the available data not estim@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Number is missed to continuously switch the injection point within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point . &quot;
&quot; heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a trained person or treated by a doctor by a intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration . &quot;
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the pri@@ mor@@ dial cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lo@@ wers blood sugar levels by stimulating the periph@@ eral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous T @-@ be of insulin sensitivity occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with a normal insulin analog .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin pulse has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achiev@@ es the full glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; from the data it was apparent that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a similar post @-@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; in 2 minutes before the meal , insulin was achieved 2 minutes before the meal , was achieved a better post@@ pran@@ dial control than with a normal insulin analog , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is spent 15 minutes after the meal begins , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control such as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ des prior to the meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is reached . &quot;
insulin sensitivity in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of the meal when compared to human normal insulin that was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) prior to meal ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin dose during intraven@@ ous 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the meal begins in comparison to human Nor@@ mal @-@ insulin that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the meal begins ( figure 1@@ C ) .
