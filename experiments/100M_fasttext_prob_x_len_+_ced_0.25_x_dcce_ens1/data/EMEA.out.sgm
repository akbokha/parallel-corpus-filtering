<seg id="4">"it is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for insertion (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"• Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder where patients can alternate manic episodes (periods of abnormal mood) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent chronic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if the oral ingesting of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used to absorb or melt tablets in patients, which causes the swallowing of tablets trouble."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, as well as bilify, the dose of bilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this does not affect the transmission of brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aria is probably primarily known as "partial agonist" for receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol helps to normalize the activity of the brain whereby psychotic or manic symptoms are reduced and their recurrence is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent recurrence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia, or similar disorders that suffered severe unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, bilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of bilify and placebo, to prevent recurrence in 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with bilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased restlessness, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the patient's symptoms based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received ambilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness than those who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, bilify in four of the five short-term studies decreased manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented more efficacy than placebo for recurrence of chronic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of bilify for taking (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled Zucken), Acathens (constant movement), hypertension, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke with Aripiprazol, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, when oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of bilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes associated with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inhaler is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after alternation of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide using Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiac disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accumulative and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia arising during the treatment with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if there are signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia with abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol had an increased risk of mortality compared to the placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study with a fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to unwanted cerebrovascular events with aripiprazole treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to allow immediate comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyphagie, polyphagie and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in relation to deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of anti-psychotics, where weight gain is known as a side effect, and may lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famigdin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically non-relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study involving healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolites may result in the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol in comparison with CYP2D6 Extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the joint administration of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibites with abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of abilify should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or CYP2D6 together with abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg. Aripiprazol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethmorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C19 (omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethmorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be used during pregnancy due to the insufficient data situation for people and due to the concerns produced in reproductive studies at the animal, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk of the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol does not have a negative impact on it."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathens, Dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study, over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazol was 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disruptions - in a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 22.5% was reported in patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 53.3% in patients under operidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">"in the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks with a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinical significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not result in medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"cavities of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"adverse events related to antibiotic therapy include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and cerebrovascular events, adverse cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing, since Aripiprazole has high plasma cutting."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine absorption and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTA receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HTA receptor as well as an even affinity for dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7 receptor, for alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks on healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11c-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and at the putfile."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a half-operidol-controlled study, 52% of responder patients who contributed a response to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measuring scales defined as secondary destinations, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, aria was significantly higher for Aripiprazol, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia for more than 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior effectiveness against placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy effect compared to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in week 12, Aripiprazol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partly did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol showed superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved a remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazol showed itself superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, primarily in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyloisation of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkening is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The average Eliminationshal period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol with extensive metabolizers on CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= "poor") metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazol, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-up-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh-class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on liver function of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated application, reproductionability toxicity, genotoxicity and the canerogenous potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans so they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (the 10fold of the middle Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the galle of monkeys after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations of sulphate conjugates of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- aripiprazole are no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility."</seg>

<seg id="1654">"changed active ingredient" means that the tablets are set in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other is slowly released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">"aerosaze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents aged 12 and older, the recommended dose of aerosol is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main function dimensions were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms recorded by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"when considering all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients reported a decrease in symptoms of 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a 37.4% relief of the symptoms of 26.7% compared to the patients who took Lloratadin alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (cardiac chase), mouth dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (absence of appetite), somnolence (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness."</seg>

<seg id="2381">"after recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin."</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria are based on the definition of the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment"</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 dose-reducttio- a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs or - on the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above compared to patients at the age of 65 years there is an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on unquestionability and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">"in clinical trials, no dose adaptations were necessary in patients with a creatinine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which exceed the dose adjustments recommended for all patients."</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">"however, patients with liver function reduction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- Limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in the studies."</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marrow suppression and Pemetrebel may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutral number of cells returns a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has once again achieved a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.

<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients treated with Pemetrebel must be used to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for the reduction of treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non-steroidal antiphlogistika (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to the therapy to avoid treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients envisaged for treatment with Pemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life time for at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">"many patients, in which these events occurred, had appropriate risk factors for occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting hypertension or diabetes."</seg>

<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-clearances ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal antiphlogistika (such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) lead to a reduced pemetrexed elimination with the result of an increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is advisable when treating high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in patients with normal renal function (creatinin-clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in a high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy - be avoided on the day of treatment and minimum 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">"as there is no data in relation to the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-value such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetre- xed."</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy also require increased surveillance frequency of INR (International Regentuated Ratio) when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with more anti-timetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"pemetrexed should not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary - and after careful weighing of the use for the mother and the risk of the fetus (see section 4.4)."</seg>

<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease increased again with more patients than with the reference doctor; moreover, Alpheleon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test conducted in the study was not sufficiently validated to investigate the question of how far the drug is immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug)."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat impetigo (skin infection accompanied by crust formation) and small infected infirs (crack or cutting wounds), abrasions and stitching wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against this type of infections may not be effective.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the area to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was gone after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin cells, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar responses: if the results of both studies were taken together in Hautwunden, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, however, that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA, not effective enough."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation to the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo at short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were outweighed against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small lains, scratches or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission issued Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the case of sensitizing or serious local irritation due to the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is aborted, the ointment is meticulously blurred and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections, in which MRSA is known or suspected as pathogens (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials in patients infected with secondary infections, the efficacy of retinas in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2699">The mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis due to interaction at a specific binding point of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site contains ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P bindings and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding at this binding point, Pleuromutiline inhibits the Peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding interaction and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of Retapamulin in at least some forms of infection appear questionable, a consultation by experts should be sought."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"no differences were found in the in-vitro activity of retinas compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of failure to respond to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambient is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years of age which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"ambient is applied as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after the second dose is administered."</seg>

<seg id="2727">"vaccines work by" contributing to the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "as it can fight against a disease."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after receiving the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as" "foreign" "and creates antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ambient contains the same constituents as the vaccine, which has been approved since 1996, and the vaccine Twinrix Children has been approved since 1997."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same disease, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because ambient and Twinrix adult ingredients contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 month distance between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient assisted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambient's degree of protection was similar to six and a 12-month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headaches, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matiness (fatigue) and irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"ambient may not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic)."</seg>

<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means it works faster and has a shorter active duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body does not produce insulin in two studies with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Apidra has been studied in a study involving 878 adults in type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study involving type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lispro."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the HbA1c concentration decreased 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra must not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin ulisins, or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal belt."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can change the insulin requirement."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 A insufficient dosage or termination of treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of the occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the bias of hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, propoxyphene, salicylates, and sulfonamid antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, the symptoms of adrenergic counter-regulation can be weakened under the effect of sympathetic agents such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and reserpine."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive-toxicity showed no difference between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin is hypersensitive to human breast milk, but in general insulin is neither absorbed into breast milk nor is it resoralized after oral application."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"occurrences listed in clinical trials are listed according to system organs and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very frequent: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rarely known (frequency based on the available data not estimable)."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"Lipodystrophy Number is missed to continuously switch the injection point within the injection area, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"heavy hypoglycemics with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a trained person or treated by a doctor by a intravenous intravenous administration."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primordial cause of severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous T-be of insulin sensitivity occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with a normal insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisin showed a disproportionate glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin pulse has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosescing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"from the data it was apparent that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a similar post-prandial glycaemic control is achieved like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"in 2 minutes before the meal, insulin was achieved 2 minutes before the meal, was achieved a better postprandial control than with a normal insulin analog, which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"if insulin is spent 15 minutes after the meal begins, a similar glycaemic control such as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 Mi- nudes prior to the meal (see Figure 1), is reached."</seg>
