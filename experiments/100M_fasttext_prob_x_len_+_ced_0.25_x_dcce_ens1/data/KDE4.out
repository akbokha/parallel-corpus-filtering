&quot; to translate the module website , go to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras site . select the initial and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated in place of the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a crude translation , and in the worst case non@@ sense . &quot;
only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish page by yourself where you can insert translated text directly .
&quot; the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available . &quot;
further information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings extensions ... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard Settings modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that more modules may be installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or package ; before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click Tools Canc@@ el . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present , deleted . &quot;
the module An@@ umb@@ filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar below ex@@ tras filtering . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects using the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
&quot; each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; FS@@ View ; displays the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries therein . therefore , large files can easily be detected even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , it can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the description display represents a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color geb@@ anding and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view colour mode , can be either Dep@@ th for the easy recognition of the bl@@ ending depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder .
&quot; as a rule for tre@@ em@@ aps , it should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . &quot;
&quot; as divi@@ ding the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation remains up to the implementation . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimum adverti@@ sed area for one entry on the menu entry view pane at surface . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .

&quot; more than 1000 digital cameras can be downloaded via the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the handling capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works fully in the 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC colour management - workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens to be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement opportunities . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you are using these short@@ cuts , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all necessary information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you to answer questions from other users here . however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should be so powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ cam page ; visit homepage to find news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best way to start &amp; digi@@ play ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing up in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; first run , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . just enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data retri@@ eve is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam , you will additionally use as an old library . settings digi@@ K@@ am create collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a compilation of photos on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; look at each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you cannot exclude sub@@ folders , unless it is in hidden folder . you can do this by inser@@ ting one point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List will not have photos as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Favor@@ ites to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it may also deal with it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a specific camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help Desk support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h workflow sequences .
&quot; more than 1000 digital cameras can be downloaded via the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer .
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . as photos generally are large files and transfers via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably .
one of the most beautiful things to be &amp; digi@@ ous ; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; ti@@ pi modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view to develop . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the ki@@ pi modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is considerably easier , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even carry out . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or Ctr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag@@ ging and storing pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , over the horizontal divi@@ ding line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot put into keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . thus , filtering on the fil@@ ename functions only if this ind &apos;s symbol view is also displayed . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the al@@ ben@@ ign settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos , which are stored on the hard drive , are sorted by the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ a properties or after the date on which the album was first created , sorted . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; in order to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the destination album and drop it there . you can also move or copy several photos on the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , click the right mouse button on the album and select the album menu in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Colle@@ ctions : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
&quot; the buttons el@@ dest , average , New Year : these set the date to the oldest , newest image or the average of the album . &quot;
&quot; when you first select an album in &amp; digi@@ ur ; open , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&quot; the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos , of course . &quot;
&quot; the screen window provides you with the main screen of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe heads in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you need to wait briefly , while the thumb@@ nails are generated . &quot;
&quot; information about each picture is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can set about settings digi@@ kam ; set up . select the albums page and customize the area thumb@@ nails to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails feature help boxes that appear . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the chapter Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such an help window .
&quot; photos are all you have to do with &amp; digi@@ ous ; go . albums and Tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to make a number of improvements to this . you can choose between viewing images , slideshow , or editing the images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button , and Edit ... Select your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them . &quot;
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu by opening . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing other image processing programs can occur with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&amp; Edit ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the thumb@@ nail to view and rotate it . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the fil@@ ename of a picture , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo &amp; digital ; delete it , it will be moved to the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of &amp; k@@ de ; Del@@ ete . F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Del If you want to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organis@@ es your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . &quot;
&quot; tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a cue point has been assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree , which allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key list ; to collapse , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also import your keywords in other programs as soon as it was digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the pictures are noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking the right button of the button , either at &amp; quot ; My keywords , or select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword after clicking on an existing word , this will become the sub@@ sti@@ ch@@ word of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a stit@@ ch by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword may be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a stit@@ ch by clicking it with the right mouse button and select the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can click on the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select &quot; &quot; assign &quot; &quot; from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be viewed under the thumb@@ nail preview in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button . the menu only displays the keywords attached to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time@@ frame , you only have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which displays the time unit . this displays all the associated images in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; all elements of the database include names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; when searching for nothing , then the lamp is red . &quot;
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars .
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the header OK and the search is performed . &quot;
&quot; if you select search process , the form to enter the search appears again with the search information previously entered . if you select as advanced search , the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search . find more information in the section The tool for the Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select search in the context menu Search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ous ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the alarm database . all rules will be added , deleted by operators or deleted from it . each option can be added to this list with search group / search group . additionally , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; this allows images to compare by comparing these sign@@ atures . the smaller the difference between two sign@@ atures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . by drag@@ ging a picture from anywhere on the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand ink sket@@ ch : draw a fast sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; finds the right pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or zo@@ oming with the mouse wheel . move it while you press the left mouse button . all pictures within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this assumes your pictures ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&quot; it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctr@@ l ; L &apos;@@ em illuminated table from the pop @-@ up menu .
&quot; from the thumb@@ nail , you can drag the images you want to compare , drag in the left or right pane of the window and place there . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to sort out quickly from a picture series . if you use p@@ airing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images will automatically appear in the right pane . the right image will be displayed in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal fire fighting actions also directly work out directly from the light table such as F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can detect on the crossed arrows . in order to keep the visible area of the picture , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down in mode preview , then both images will display the same image area . &quot;
zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ controller under the images or Ctr@@ l ; mou@@ se@@ wheel to zoom into the image and zoom into the image . this happens in both pictures when you &apos;re in the preview mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers any part of the process following after the image has been taken , sc@@ ans or digital photos carries out a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;ll give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , use , protect , and use photos again . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management assumes , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , safegu@@ ards , conver@@ ts , trans@@ forms , trans@@ forms , and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is according to your definition data that provide information on or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you need no longer need to locate a certain photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use certainly not to use a specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use a very fast search and secure archiving which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files need to be somehow organized on your computer , or on a network drive &amp; etc . keep in mind that you have to switch to a larger drive some@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the photos will be organized by your date . if you take sufficient photos , then you will be able to use sub @-@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export is a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a web page . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers also have other requirements such as version@@ ing images , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different subjects and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % are working files and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes stac@@ king easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an deri@@ v@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend saving the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam the metadata settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the corresponding item from the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all images that need the same attribute and set the value . you can best start with the rating or ranking . this makes sense as you can focus on further work on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalog@@ u@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then it will be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically arrange the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the lower trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you &apos;re sure to be interested in how your photos will arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer to it , start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if an image is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) as cap@@ tion . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a te@@ di@@ ous planet in front of Google Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives already with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities to take advantage of ge@@ olo@@ cation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys by using images with Google Earth . you can also export the images to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ckr &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information was in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
&quot; the author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the photographer &apos;s name , then the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the photographer &apos;s work name . examples of this may be titles like : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is a stock photograph , then the group / agency that offers the image is provided here . &quot;
&quot; the solution to this problem is digital water@@ marks . for private persons , this protection is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; message : Hello , I was looking at rock @-@ gear.de today and found something that might be interesting for you . &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . this kind of loss is the same that can also happen in traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section , it concerns problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery firm , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these cau@@ tious issues must be treated and you can no longer trust you than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you are using good discs and good recording devices and keep them in the right way . so , the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age them by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you need to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers of manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , SM@@ ART may not detect these errors . &quot;
&quot; of course you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not matter much , this is different for devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these can cause serious damage . so , protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most common protection against black@@ heads is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is normally available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting the protection against lightning strikes and thus protecting the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that even all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers also provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors , which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . &quot;
&quot; this is only a small price difference if you consider how good your computer is protected . finally , you should remember how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always remember all the cables before you go on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data . &quot;
you are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . additionally you need to send the data over the compar@@ atively slow internet .
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ckr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transm@@ issions are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says to you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . it &apos;s pretty distur@@ bing that there is no protection in your computer until you have ever thought of it . no one seems to have ever thought about it . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle desktop failures on a low level . it is open source , available with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that use Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux , no longer has been si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : un@@ true , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ fs , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : un@@ true , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limitations . this means that while the technology further develops , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far from this limit . &quot;
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 megapixel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anyone else for data loss . so backup your data frequently following a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and ste@@ els are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , in your office or the like . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common cause of a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
&quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot;
&quot; differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup , generates a complete snap@@ shot at two times : that of the complete backup and the last differential backup . &quot;
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup .
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that really have been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h . &quot;
save important images right after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ TC information , associated XMP files , original retained , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus , valuable images survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is unfor@@ es@@ eeable due to your nature , you need to look at everything that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate yourself while time passes . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have ski@@ pped the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and move it to a new disk :
&quot; use the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new record has been detected by the system , but do not attach it . &quot;
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification .
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . so you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is loss @-@ free , supports XMP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithms ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
&quot; DNG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available , and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it some@@ time . &quot;
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to em@@ bed the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive the original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards , which supports a wide range of applications and business models . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edit mode , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , enco@@ ding them in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ cam . in the section add a photos to an album , you will find a description as to how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for impor@@ ting images to your legacy database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera onto the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if this is the case , the fil@@ ename and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not provide all the information available .
&quot; the Metad@@ ata tab displays the internal metadata such as Exif , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is to click the download button and then download the selection from all .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the required selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download selected . the selected button is gra@@ yed until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New to download is available . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons All you want to download or download the selected folder , you will see a dialog with which you can select the target album . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; Edit ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos are successfully deleted from the camera , so you should carefully check whether the photos are successfully deleted from the camera . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally utilized again after the photos are deleted from the camera . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made to integrate in the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options to rotate and mirror image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three further options that are done before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % y@@ - % d % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . for further adap@@ tations you should read the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option &quot; &quot; Camera Name &quot; &quot; option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case letters , if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ ename used for a photo is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically , when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; you can read all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the metadata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic turning , use the Advanced button and select the Auto Rot@@ ate in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date when the photo was made available , it can be edited and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; this sub @-@ albums are based on the image data . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the destination album . if you want to change this , you &apos;ll need to switch on this option . use the Advanced button and select the Dat@@ e- based sub @-@ color option at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the selection of images is done , you wonder where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder and click OK to start the up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and latitude , which can be displayed on a map . the data can be identified by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graphy an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser window showing the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users want to send users who want to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data get into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ ages and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated with GPS receiver . but there are a few that work together with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a map module or via transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading of GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS and cor@@ relate . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the length and latitude grade or other data then you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pr@@ elo@@ id coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ google . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European street maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; to access these settings , you need to change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to change in the Options menu ; set up . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
select action can display or start image processing on embedded preview . you stack the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should be the photographer &apos;s professional title . this can be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to enter the photo . this does not have to be the author if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available for other programs and can be in &amp; digi@@ kam ; imports will not be lost .
&quot; save cap@@ tions as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter rests over a file . depending on the option chosen , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ous ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify what file types &amp; editing tries , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
&quot; you can reset the default settings again by pressing the &quot; &quot; Ref@@ res@@ h &quot; &quot; button to the right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ escent by &amp; digi@@ kam can be set on this page to the default values . each time you open the brightness , these settings are turned on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better picture results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch off the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark and bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation .
&quot; setting PNG compression allows you to reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can switch the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF image . it does not affect the image quality as the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy settings , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only an image viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default is that all green pixels are equal . if you are using this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . if you use this option , you eliminate this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option is a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard it is a solid colour balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the sh@@ ear@@ lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the pointed @-@ lights , so the parts of your images that are burned into the settings . the setting colors trigger a few unusual results as it shows the sh@@ red@@ ders in various ros@@ em@@ ary tones . finally , you can attempt to re@@ build some parts of missing information from the pointed lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible , as blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ f therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red particles from the still un@@ filled blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select re@@ constructions , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing . to keep the time for dem@@ os@@ a@@ thing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a full picture of the partial raw data generated by the color fil@@ tered image sensor , which have many cameras and that a matrix of colored pixels are available . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction . &quot;
&quot; after some tests , it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty @-@ Direc@@ ted ) , it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . cheap is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue color correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for color correc@@ ting , as you are carried out during conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a color space to translate into the other means that the colors are as accurate as possible .

&quot; the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model that you are using . not all profiles are built in the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to do the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate , as your image can be given by one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller paint area than your camera and some colors therefore highly atur@@ ated . this could be done manually , rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , a table of cameras and profiles will fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
ki@@ pi is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a set of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface it can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the ki@@ pi interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the ki@@ pi modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the main window and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks carried out by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands . &quot;
more information ( in English ) about ki@@ pi @-@ modules can be obtained from the ki@@ pi @-@ project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the ki@@ pi modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adju@@ sts the time between the transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . &quot;
&quot; on the right side there is a button Auto detection that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire storage devices are supported . &quot;
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras .
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to display mode . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can manually set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window cameras . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer displays , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; for del@@ eting a photo in one album , you will find more details on del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be used sil@@ ently through &amp; digi@@ ous ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to save changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also set the display of the splash screen by &amp; digi@@ kam ; to disable the start , this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; &quot;
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m start to search for new photos &amp; digi@@ kam ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this leng@@ th@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if anything from the base folder has been deleted , inqu@@ ires &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it is supposed to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the design tool@@ bar in settings design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ous ; to create , find more information in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; Edit ; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on pre@@ viewing a picture or through the context menu of preview and selecting the entry / editing entry .
&quot; the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; therefore , you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the ti@@ pi modules in the image processing section . &quot;
&quot; status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and underneath the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly needed functions .
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before saving file or saving the Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done using file Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rest@@ ore menu or using the Rest@@ ore button to restore image editing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last saving . &quot;
&quot; almost any action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Re@@ ver@@ ing or Rest@@ ore , by selecting Edit Re@@ verse from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the short@@ cut short@@ cut , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and remember Ctr@@ l ; Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; using the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar one moment longer , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctr@@ l ; mou@@ se@@ wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can also view this in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File image file and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print@@ dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sets . whole picture pages can be printed out of your selection . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Album Export Editor assistant . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available , without the navigation file , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five tab is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be trun@@ cated to 2000 characters and special characters are scann@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should observe these limitations . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the App@@ ly button , there is a button More . with this you can read other metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images . &quot;
&quot; the Assessment section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the rating is written into the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . enco@@ ding follows the diagram in the following table :
&quot; keywords : Park@@ way Drive , Green@@ field , festival , Inter@@ laken , live , stage , band , 200@@ 90@@ 6@@ 13 , Pit@@ fire , Shel@@ ley Jam@@ b@@ res@@ ic &quot;
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered keyword . you can easily restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the file keyword keyword keyword .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keywords tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with its Album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , Thread and Su@@ its Views . if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also pull and disc@@ ard keywords . if the keywords already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then , a dialog appears asking you whether you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and state that it would be a or its , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify an advanced search through all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group . the options will look as follows : &quot;
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ckr not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors that you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic of color management comes , everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results that he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make informed decisions about how to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all the six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; your only other image output is by e @-@ mail or Web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB doesn &apos;t work so well and makes life for everyone so simple , why should you use another color space and worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and colours in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then click on information about RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to monitor your monitor , since s@@ RGB is based on s@@ RGB . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alizing , comparing , automatic comparing and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction try automatically to make the best out of your colors . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ osity values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out . &quot;
&quot; this method adju@@ sts the brightness factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . &quot;
&quot; this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a real@@ ignment of all values in between .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly limited as a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . so if you can do the white balance in rough mode , which operates in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
the preview window can be customized in size . on the left side you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image .
the thumb@@ nail preview has a red marker . the pixel spac@@ ing below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in hist@@ ogram .
&quot; this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the controls mentioned above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected colour to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; additionally , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Up@@ load buttons do exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you into a text file and load it later .
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to its standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the enco@@ ding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit enco@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this enco@@ ding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under colors tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , so that you always need the same correction and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for ton@@ ing correction you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the tool colour effects provide you with four color effects , a solar vibration effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that resulted in a short flash light and followed the development of the image . the coloured , dar@@ ker areas protected the image of the image . this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; intensity controls the solar power . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ers . &quot;
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it handles the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a reverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common to adjust the colour contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can attempt to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
&quot; if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool can be used for the improvement of exposure . even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slide . more concrete the three sliders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph are three sliders into which can be moved and that can be moved to change the brightness values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the regulator , and take care of how the image changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right you can view the original and preview of the image . preview will be dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left side are the following options available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : using this sel@@ ector can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic distribution is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three kno@@ bs : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color p@@ pet@@ tes can be used in pre@@ viewing the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright notes . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively , e.g. in the input values . the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a f@@ aded image as a background while seeing something else in the foreg@@ round . &quot;
&quot; automatic : with this button , the picture values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and re@@ charged later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are adjusted automatically for all shadows , middle and sun shades . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example for the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that changes from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most useful . in this case the linear mode also helps to generate a broad beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and dar@@ ker the corresponding pixel image pixels . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve showing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance canal . shade and sun shades were placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to blend the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when mixing mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion so that you can reduce your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you reduce the bro@@ ws first . &quot;
the saving as and loading buttons are used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you later and load it later . the used file format is the g@@ im@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;

&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , Schwarz / Weiß is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red len@@ tic@@ filter . this creates dramatic sky@@ light effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light scenes during day@@ time . so similar to the 003 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow liner filter . this is the most natural color setting correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscape and therefore similar to the 001 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to 005 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ ia filter .
use the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool texture apply you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image texture apply the image processing can be used . &quot;
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; Add tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the boundaries of a picture is not an easy task . it is an opportunity to keep the image of a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . penet@@ rates the image with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , it ends with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is reduced from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into one image at any location . &quot;
&quot; use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; every setting you selected for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved once , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more . &quot;
use the &amp; digital ; tools template you can place a template using a picture .
the template image templates apply in image processing can be used to lay templates above a picture .
for the sten@@ cil there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation .
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be scheduled for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder updates the templates of templates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under Pre@@ view , there are three buttons that allow you to change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button increases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; scale : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but it creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot;
the algorithm has been removed from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
&quot; re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus , as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG images , a camera is often applied in internal sharp@@ ness . in contrast , images in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner addresses a field filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this allows you to access sharp@@ ness with the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; however , the sharp@@ ness of the edges increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for sharp@@ ness of an image will re@@ focus the tool . under re@@ focusing , you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharp@@ ness . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ter sof@@ ter sof@@ ter and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the Filter un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and pre@@ viewing help to edit the image . preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . &quot;
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore you should shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped picture , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ ted , thus avoiding beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ ask@@ eting filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image is the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ ask@@ eting was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool re@@ focus a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected de@@ f@@ ission filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . re@@ focus usually reaches better results than bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ ask@@ eting . you can start it from the menu by calling colors re@@ focused in image processing .
&quot; the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the swelling pix@@ ies that are far from the original pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the G@@ auss folds is actually very strongly influenced by the removed pixels , causing unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further complic@@ ate the image . &quot;
&quot; if you use a value non@@ zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you have placed will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leaving unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , im@@ pi@@ ent mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , im@@ penet@@ rating mask must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur . in the Wiener filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . the FI@@ R Wiener filter is often better in handling small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
the original un@@ focused picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ foc@@ ussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
you can read a technical comparison in English under this address for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital images .
the regulator smooth@@ es the bl@@ ur of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the colour tin@@ plate allows a customized colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with un@@ parall@@ eled speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the default settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to smooth smooth@@ ness over the image . &quot;
&quot; composite dependence Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly in all directions , while a value suggests a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all . p then defines relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle @-@ incre@@ ment da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stepping width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stepping width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel size and never greater than 2 . &quot;
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by choosing this option is minimal . it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we recommend it to let it out .
&quot; the buttons save as and load precisely this . any adjustment of image errors can be corrected hereby in a text file , and then re@@ charged later . &quot;
&quot; error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation using the Canc@@ el button at any time . &quot;
&quot; the module is applied in a photo that is made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you can see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact that is caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts which occur e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ Effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window Details and the Advanced Settings window will remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) that is used for filter . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness .
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . if you want to remove a weak ru@@ stling or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the brightness tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the picture . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma @-@ tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase toler@@ ances of dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more ru@@ stling . however , it also sp@@ ends the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is respon@@ sive to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , noise and phase j@@ itter can appear at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be saved into the fil@@ esystem and then loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ter sof@@ ter sof@@ ter and experiment with the smoothing tool . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to l@@ essen photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ting , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that make the content like it also makes the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for colour@@ ing and texture correction . the texture of the texture is developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are visible in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and load precisely this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file , and then re@@ charged later . &quot;
&quot; photo @-@ Rest@@ oration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation using the button Finish at any time . &quot;
below you can see how a photo with uniform noise is restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gran@@ ting on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time texture is reduced to an old colour photo caused by a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts created by scanner lighting and phot@@ op@@ aper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels &amp; quot ; bright pixels &amp; quot ; bright pixel &amp; quot ; in a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark@@ picture directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Def@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark@@ picture to the image corrected . &quot;
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all thumb@@ nail areas .
select an area to view the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate those pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) , or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not light the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or less , as otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ness effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color or gre@@ y@@ scale lines of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a center filter by using an equivalent transformation with a center filter to an image . the algorithm is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a lens setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma setting : the editing of an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction decreases the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the brightness of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine re @-@ adjustment of the desired image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the Gra@@ dation Menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the digital@@ isation ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second degree handles the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar directional effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners opposite to that of the second degree . if you combine these two combinations any geomet@@ ric distortion can be virtually eliminated .
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion second density . with negative values , distortion @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth density . this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the image . for most of the lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the reverse sign of the parameter general . &quot;
zoom : this value scales the image size and thus leads to the correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image res@@ ize .
&quot; bri@@ gh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used for the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ ical or p@@ inc@@ us@@ hion distortion should be performed before all cutting or size changes . ideally , you perform this correction as the first one . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would be apparent from the wrong . &quot;
&quot; in order to help you to find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide line . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some subjects such as images from the front , frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film from the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which can be reached under this URL . the filter reproduced the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ular@@ ity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Add film gran@@ ular@@ ity if you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter coloured can@@ als mix for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ th@@ me@@ tic applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a type of au@@ ra in the peak lights .
&quot; this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , producers mix large Silver grades of Ph@@ ac@@ o@@ emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gran@@ ting effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the regulator can calibr@@ ate ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , can be applied to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film box effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the original image is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper one cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth checking the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smoothing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage coin . the lines whose gra@@ dients change slowly are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sket@@ ch for you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity level .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engraving em@@ bos@@ ses your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray and mon@@ ary landscape .
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and makes it look like it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the image is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; zoom bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image along the star @-@ shaped lines , which origin@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al ambig@@ u@@ ity : wi@@ pes the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
bl@@ ur@@ red bl@@ ur@@ red : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur@@ red : wi@@ pes the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photograph@@ ing from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low . &quot;
&quot; bulk mail : wi@@ pes the image through random shifting of the pixels , thus simul@@ ating the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera . &quot;
intelligent vag@@ u@@ ity : finds the color pool in the picture and wi@@ pes them without alter@@ ing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ate it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation using the button Finish at any time .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by copyright protected algorithm .
&quot; dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of drops . as the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture , it is often necessary to decrease size for small images . &quot;
&quot; use the selection tool to select the area , for example a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free from rain@@ drops . &quot;
the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . &quot;
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate or guess the details ? how can you see or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to t@@ ress the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; many imaging programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo blowing was developed by I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot;
the Save as and Up@@ load buttons are used exactly to do so . every single st@@ amping for photo can be saved as a text file and then re@@ charged later .
&quot; photo blowing is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation using the button Finish at any time . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bub@@ bles by enlar@@ ging a small picture of the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimmed ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the Save file or Save file in the File menu to save the newly trimmed photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog stays there . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Acc@@ ording to aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high format or landscape format . in the high format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ers and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area for cutting to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relation and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool Acc@@ ording to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut picture and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the co@@ ag@@ ulation aid make it possible to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden middle : the golden middle is a division based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and p@@ yr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the center of gold provides li@@ que@@ fied help lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ sail gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral , creating a symmet@@ rical visual stream . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral deb@@ ated above . its ver@@ tex points are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be released a static object more dynam@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the options Horiz@@ ontal and Ver@@ tical Mir@@ rors can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the color button , you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle . you can do this by using the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image editing and tool free rotation . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed right above . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the image preview to position the two lines . now , adjust it with a pressure to the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to use the function transform cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is Auto Cut . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image slightly after the rotation . note however the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . preview will then automatically be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new Width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
corner left top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
corner right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
corner left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
corner right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little bit lubri@@ cated . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . &quot;
&quot; this is no rotation , the picture is distor@@ ted . in other words , a square will be distor@@ ted . in other words , a square will be distor@@ ted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transforming sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed right from the preview area . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ading tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single she@@ ar , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two dra@@ ch@@ ings produce twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the she@@ ar , the image has nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . &quot;
&quot; the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , compiled from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries , it is impossible to add a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF . &quot;
&quot; if the extension is listed in the list and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions which have been digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you can modify this list of file extensions which have been digi@@ ti@@ sed ; see the configuration section for more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods on digital images . redundant information is reduced to store image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save any loss @-@ free if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . &quot;
&quot; with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supported : &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format .

many tools you need to use the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . your description will follow here .
&quot; use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture apply &quot; &quot; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter onto the current image .
ver@@ tically split without dup@@ licate . the left panel shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally divide without dup@@ licate . the top section shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the top section shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and take the part of the image from which you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are taken from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or zo@@ oming with the mouse wheel . move it while you press the left mouse button . all pictures within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this assumes your pictures ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the Pal@@ etten @-@ files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de , can either apply to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders by files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is shown in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the p@@ allet view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; in order to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or is enabled under the color button , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ rides another ; depending on whether the check box is selected . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shar@@ ehol@@ es of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line character , if there are three numer@@ ical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left side .
&quot; graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; kate ; re @-@ calculated and in &amp; graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; open or open the graph@@ s in &amp; graphic viewer ; in one &amp; kate ; -@@ component to open
load large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from around 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . required in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . in the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ gra@@ vie@@ w.@@ Read without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom scre@@ enshot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window will look like in the bottom scre@@ enshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner will be displayed if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and low without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file was modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged , or whether you want to ignore the change . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; co @-@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graph viewer , or want to display the graph@@ s to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be applied to this page . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page preview with a graph distributed across multiple pages without head@@ line , and with another font &quot;
&quot; the Er@@ ne@@ ut store page gives the ability to specify the behavior if a file has been modified on the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or leave the program any time . &quot;
&quot; the Open site gives the ability to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ em@@ acs ; if a graph is opened outside a current session , you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time is requested . &quot;
the page Se@@ ating Management provides the ability to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ gra@@ vie@@ w.@@ You can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or determine whether you start asking for each start .
&quot; the context menu , which normally appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens , opens further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for executed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
&quot; the fd@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model for executed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ ity Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then be executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph@@ s to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format , or even change the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for executed graph@@ s ) . &quot;

the ki@@ pi module reads images and provides tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the S@@ ane project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry , a dialog appears , which allows you to choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by selecting the default value duc@@ t@@ he to select your image accordingly . see the preview window and adjust the area to your needs before you can read the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . you will find more information in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after pressing the Scan button , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the image file will appear . please remember that the BMP file is not compressed and therefore created very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 , by saving the image . &quot;
&quot; you can create screen@@ shots after you select &quot; &quot; Import - &gt; Screen Sa@@ w ... &quot; . &quot; a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ des : &quot;
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; when all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; delay determines how long scre@@ enshot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the scre@@ enshot has been made , the dialogue options of the target image will appear with the options described above . &quot;
&quot; the ki@@ pi module Calendar has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the ki@@ pi team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
this module archive your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can simply select the albums to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation . also the Auto@@ Play option is available for the Windows platforms .
&quot; ki@@ pi modules extend the program in which you are loaded to include additional functions . you can add additional menus , short@@ cuts and additional abilities to the program . you can install as many modules as you want within the calling program . &quot;

&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token , so it is basically your link to Fli@@ ckr . a browser is launched to help you register on Fli@@ ckr . &quot;
&quot; after successful login , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ckr website . the following page will be presented after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ckr . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; if the module is started on Fli@@ ckr for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog confir@@ ming current access rights that the module indicates . currently , the module does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to proceed with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; once you click on the O@@ k button , you can click on the O@@ k button to upload the photos to the Fli@@ ckr server . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
&quot; with the Op@@ tional , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options you can set access rights to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as a private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value mentioned at Maximum size . &quot;
maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the ki@@ pi module gallery @-@ export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server .
&quot; the ki@@ pi module gallery export has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the ki@@ pi team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF key words of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the ki@@ pi module for loc@@ alizing geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images of ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length , length and latitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS lane as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the dialog above appears . to view a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data taken at the same places as the images of your camera . &quot;
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation that shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT time . this can be done with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS @-@ time and camera time . the devi@@ ation below will be combined with the data . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from a location for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the inter@@ pol@@ ishing options and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a series of photos at the same place . since the dialog box coordinates the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set up with the displayed map . to do so , select the region and zoom it over again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the card can always be selected manually from card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the ki@@ pi module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ gen@@ tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery of HTML pages conform to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . you can select all albums that are exported to HTML . you will not need to select these albums . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the page preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , and eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . for this , select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG image format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; tab thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images to be displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module generated the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during production . the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the ki@@ pi image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL basi@@ fying tool to view images .
&quot; the ki@@ pi image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as fil@@ ming , zo@@ oming or shifting . it has been designed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown as standard in full screen mode . this can be changed to a win@@ do@@ wed mode . &quot;
the ki@@ pi JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows to store images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual losses in quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since there is no compression of color information . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module digital camera client is a tool to connect to your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the ki@@ pi module digital camera client has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the ki@@ pi team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module Metad@@ ata Editor is currently not a documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the ki@@ pi team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please see exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the ki@@ pi MPEG Enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG Enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create a DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . finally , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show . then you can start using Extras MPEG slide show to start the module .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting images or content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should specify the time in seconds which will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should let it black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep as the extension mp@@ g as possible .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets via the button settings right down . &quot;
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print out with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
&quot; with this ki@@ pi module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it creates the same results as the software from your camera creator . sometimes , you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the RAW file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w picture converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the converting process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ ename will remain the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged image format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your images frequently or later use them later , you should not choose the JPEG format , because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif info . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to break this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch converting mode allows you to convert several images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , for example by testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or increase the image . there are four types of image changes available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
non @-@ Pro@@ por@@ tional : non @-@ proportional res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photographic print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this ti@@ pi module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the picture window will display the images selected by you . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the list of images and put them there to add them to the list of the images to be sent .
with the button pictures remove the selected images from the list of the images to be sent .
&quot; after you have selected all pictures , click OK to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected by you are attached as attachment . &quot;
don &apos;t pay attention to too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format under the Image File menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ free formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG , if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG under pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so that you can view the status messages , in search of errors . &quot;
&quot; after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window will appear with questions like you want your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transi@@ tions option in the presentation enable very elegant image transi@@ tions with Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the option fil@@ ename indicates that the fil@@ ename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the images in the album .
1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses a different effect between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the ki@@ pi team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with notes , you can browse &amp; photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , you are now available in every group , i.e. in individuals , places and in group keywords records . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information to view your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course look at the current preview images . in the following each one is described . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; when you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both individuals are visible . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand pictures to a few individual images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of her name . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to specify which image to be displayed for each individual person . to do so , you need to select the image editor window ( in detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you invo@@ ke the entry in the main window , a dialog appears to you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog on the image again . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string of characters in the label or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all images by name as you can see in the picture . here you can see pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user &apos;s guide for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but rather try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry on photo@@ album ; demo . then , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to print this hand@@ book , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline .
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can view the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview image ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of time bar by holding the mouse button down and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of time bar . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; provides you with two possibilities to create HTML websites with your images . one is in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following section of the user manual , the in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which can be accessed via the HTML menu ... &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages are created you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following each area is described more precisely . &quot;
first enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ album ; HTML examples pages you &apos;ll see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . more information about expor@@ ting files can be found in .
&quot; finally , you can select which information should be displayed on the HTML page . therefore , you can avoid that all images are visible from a party . for example , that all images are visible from a party . therefore , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not addressed specifically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . thus , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you set . so , you can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your ima@@ gery , you can check whether these really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will launch in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder you need to manually copy them to it . to enable the import function , see , correctly , you need to specify the final destination of the files , but the base folder where all sub @-@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings that are currently described have moved all three to base folders and URLs . in this , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; come together , you may want to create a HTML page for viewing images . &quot;
with &amp; photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the respective images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will not be found , but this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for expor@@ ting images is described , which you can access via the File Export menu ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choices :
for the Manual to copy the .@@ k@@ im file close to the .@@ k@@ im file you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Autom@@ atically Add to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most of the pictures are compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... select , will &amp; photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the Wiz@@ ard to import is made up of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the imported file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box to import the categories of the imported file , and which categories they match in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will see the different steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) searching and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ tations . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently this also closes videos with . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file index.@@ x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read another database in &amp; photo@@ album ; read another folder tree with images , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; in the following section of the User Manual , you will find the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; to the left you can see six different icons , with which you can view settings for preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing a button click on the F1 key and one click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups like objects , animals or albums for each image . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog which is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section Options , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the left part of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left part of the window , there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
this module system is called ki@@ pi and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . more information about this can be found on the website of ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; as the modules are used together with each other together , it may be that the modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should first test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via ti@@ pi together are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use ki@@ pi , is that the other applications don &apos;t support their pictures in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; photo@@ album ; this sort of order isn &apos;t supported , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album , &amp; photo@@ album has to be released ; the modules are also released on a list of albums . this works with photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category that you have set in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums . for example , if you use the category people , you will be able to select the category people , so if you would have chosen people to view this and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; is the possibility to include any image with notes . this includes information about the people depicted in the picture , where the image is recorded , etc . , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen have been recorded . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to reloc@@ ate the images inside the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are shown , you can , so that the names used are moved up to find the people faster and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any comments for each image individually , you may still want to edit all the selected images and ann@@ ot@@ ate these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are under the thumb@@ nail of the image to the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at one time with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you will see a browser window showing the USA as a sub@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and p@@ anning the bar , which form the edge of the frame , by drag@@ ging it out of a frame by drag@@ ging it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options ... and then hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; for example , see here . you can configure the thumb@@ nail size by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be created as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select from the Edit selection menu . now the window will appear to you that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; photo@@ album ; that is to use pictures without having saved on the hard drive .
&quot; images showing the right upper corner are not saved on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that you can view the thumb@@ nails . however , you can not view these images using the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy them into . &quot;
&quot; in the Images Gallery you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that in the end you can also block all the images that your little sister is allowed to see , control and lock the menu item All except current view . &quot;
&quot; in this way , you have specified which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry , so if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very safe . firstly , anyone who can access the file index.@@ x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection serves only those who are familiar with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar to take a look at private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you use all your images with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to contem@@ plate them some@@ time . for this reason , you can start a photo@@ album ; through a picture _ and video viewer . you can start it from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . it of course shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box is on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard it elsewhere . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images uploaded to the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing Ctr@@ l and Plus buttons . &quot;
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; photo@@ album ; it is able to switch to full@@ screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the whole space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; if you are using the viewer , you can enter the image in the image and zoom out . with the mouse button , you can easily zo@@ oming a rect@@ angle with the mouse button . the minus button lets you zoom out in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is highlighted and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be zo@@ omed . with the uni@@ formity set the zo@@ oms so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the single zo@@ om@@ sur@@ geri@@ es function in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the script functions from the context menu you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item Rem@@ ar@@ ks from the context menu .
&quot; when you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you might just prefer to mark the picture and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the images on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while watching one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to paint pictures with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature by clicking on the characteristics A , B and C . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your images , you will be able to see them in your browser . so if you have any images that you edit , print or whatever you have selected , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in dre preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can reverse your mind later . &quot;
&quot; in order to switch off the painting mode from the context menu . to exit the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to know the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully ma@@ stered , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand . &quot;
in the object tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views display yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object since all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object .
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on either the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu item . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with delete either from the menu bar , under Edit or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed your properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL User documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture mapping ) , check local . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag the control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the superior object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected , or their visibility level smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under an existing view , pull the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , draw the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , pull the beginner right in the middle of another view . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing at the top left pointing arrow in the optic line . &quot;
&quot; to view a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer strip . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any type of views . &quot;
&quot; you can save the current window view with View window and save it . a dialog appears , where you can save the window system under an existing or new name . &quot;
if you have created a scene you can render them render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering ; this program has to be properly installed . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
&quot; to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering the Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view Sc@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a fast pre@@ viewing to complete images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you see the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the size of the card , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you just want to render a small part of the picture , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the picture section for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the quality drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the rendering properties can be found in the User Manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one pixel per pixel , several errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stage effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally pictures with this property look better .
&quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling is adap@@ tive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is split again and again and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre @-@ defined threshold , the pixels are divided into 4 sub@@ pixels , which are individually monitored and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to create noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams with a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last option for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection will be calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the alpha channel to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have not hit an object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; unexpected stops , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; Sc@@ ene Sc@@ ene , select the Import menu item ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet complete control of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or war@@ nings occur when impor@@ ting error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply mark the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . set the path to your documentation and the version . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported .
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in camera view and in the window type registration plates .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the objects displayed , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; advanced projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature creates a better approach for projec@@ tions , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; when you display walls , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the ground , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you select edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can specify the values for depth and threshold value . more precise information on parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can modify existing window arrangements , or create new window arrangements . in the window arrangements section , you will explain how to create and store window assignments . &quot;
the drop down standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of window curtains presents all existing window arrangements . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected order with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views you can create with the button Add and delete selected views with the button removal .
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a card map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start with no more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything error free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window system : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit menu item . so you have a scene without objects . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera is in control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you press the App@@ ly button or press En@@ ter button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree will instantly change according to these settings . as a result , they view the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example you could insert a header ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a troubles@@ ome method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers actually a simpler way . you can use an infinite layer as soil :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or the En@@ ter . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited ending level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displac@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should post@@ p@@ one the floor to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little bit of time at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog opens , where you can select how to insert the object . you can change the name in the property window . you can view the name in the property tab ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment shows only a matte black material because you can check the pig@@ ment settings at any time . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and ball in the preview , click App@@ ly button and then go to the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list , you have to enter two new attributes , called Single colour . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
please choose in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to execute this step as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the button or press the button ) , so the ball would float above the floor as you moved the floor to one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , insert a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; first Ob@@ jective and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , then select Single colour and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the gloss effect and reflection settings are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet chosen : &quot;
&quot; you should have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that render the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the image is just black . obviously , any scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
&quot; open a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you do not have saved changes in the scene yet .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Back@@ ground .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;

opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump map is a way to pre @-@ order rough surfaces without being individually shaped on the surface and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and a texture mapping .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed to give them a more realistic look .
&quot; a texture mapping is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel based , by applying a picture file as a color chart . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can set whether any image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a suitable fil@@ ename is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of working of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can adjust to the bottom . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are looking at the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; while preserving the name of the recently opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so , set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can display the program as well . &quot;
&quot; with this option , large images will magni@@ fy the display window to the full screen . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the card cards , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub @-@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .

&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ ename you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
notice : it &apos;s impossible to insert more than one sliders into the same page !
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
&quot; as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes its part to , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will display a page to report problems and wishes . all necessary information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to display your message . &quot;

the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ casing is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ car ; .
&quot; in order to access these settings , you need to change the behavior of the show@@ piece ; in order to access these settings , you need to change the behavior of the show@@ piece ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ car ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images .
&quot; it is an application to scan images , which do not make more than scan and save images . &quot;
&quot; and output string ; is a simple application for scanning images that can no longer be scann@@ ed and saved as images , and save images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . &quot;
you can review the status of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the information on this search page : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &quot; &quot; output &quot; &quot; ; with the command skan@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be set in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog will be opened to select the scanner . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . cancel is set to quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . &quot;
&quot; when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and s@@ lay ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will return to the main window . &quot;
the Pre@@ ferences panel opens the name of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the way to select images . open dialogue to save for each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if you want to save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking a fil@@ ename to ask . &quot;
&quot; the default value is your home directory , and you can change it with the button ... change . &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images that are automatically stored and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix which is automatically recorded each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the output string ; manual . the button will start the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish and output .

&quot; the global short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; button . &quot;
&quot; you may possibly set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Short@@ cuts , so make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are usually found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function pause could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user feedback , if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use a dialog so that the user knows why a script is not running . &quot;
begin require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you &apos;ll quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the D@@ CO@@ P command ; which should be included in each K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages enable execution of external programs and commands . in this way D@@ CO@@ P &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can even ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to view the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ Change indicates that a new piece is sp@@ elt . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; additional information on the new piece can be asked with D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the length of the piece ) .
volume Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; in order to add one entry to the menu , the D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok script add@@ custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) can be used to remove one entry . to remove one entry , one can use D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok script add@@ custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , send &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , saving data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; these packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can be optionally downloaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name like e.g. my@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ oc@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the authorization amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining load@@ able modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can click on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org comments and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus . perhaps you just search for a certain song from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
&quot; and if the choice is still difficult , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
usually you have to type the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile time point using the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . &quot;
&quot; you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any effort about the decoration dialog . the set @-@ up dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; to display the player window , the player window will in addition to the playlist . if the option is switched off , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot;
use tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the vocal bar@@ ometer .
&quot; create atmosph@@ er@@ ically : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ ot@@ able . this changes the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer . &quot;
create mood files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files .
&quot; external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started , when a browser is required . &quot;
&quot; use other browsers : here you can enter the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; when saving , the current playlist will automatically save the playlist when ending &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when ending . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; keeping up @-@ to @-@ date piece of play can be seen to keep the play@@ lists window open / off , in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
changing the context browser to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is sp@@ elt .
in the appearance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting O@@ wn Writ@@ ings , the otherwise grey paragraph can be selected . you can select fon@@ ts for the following section : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of customized color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color selection enabled for foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;
&quot; playback at the start means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start res@@ ume playback automatically begins with the piece at the point , with which it was stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; set up the O@@ SD on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if On @-@ Screen display is indicated , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadows cause the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; use your own colors gives you the opportunity to customize the O@@ SD colours for writing and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog to choose color selection . if you do not use the colors , the default colors will be used . &quot;
&quot; the Display text input field provides the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , so you can set the screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment to appear on the O@@ SD . &quot;
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers activate additional settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; to search a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up , as with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse this sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folders will search for music .
&quot; monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import Play@@ lists : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the playlist @-@ browser .
&quot; the Part Collection database is used to select a database for the collection . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , it is necessary to set up a new facility in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l configuration section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : if the machine is entered , the network port is entered , under which the database is reached . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required to connect to the database .
the load@@ .@@ f@@ m card card sets the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece when needed .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send playing pieces and so update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile , in order to be able to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find modules or scripts ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as O@@ SD require that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble , for example , we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete the file that caused the crash . &quot;
most of the time this is because Tag@@ lib is crashing when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all used libraries compiled by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this will lead to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will open automatically when it crashes ) . if it is a common crash , and you will send us a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed . &quot;
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information but not as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( shu@@ ffle mode / re@@ play / dynamic playlist ) always look into K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 .
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ oc@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first . &quot;
there are a number of options . most installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please only make a mistake there , if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; just a blank playlist will appear . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to intui@@ tively hold the interface , the startup window has been converted into the statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for review by the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column review . you can also select the keyboard short@@ cuts on Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list remove from the pop @-@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist with the mouse to the playlist and let them fall there , just like you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add @-@ button , the playlist is saved . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ mms @-@ config l@@ acks you . install the package x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it on the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; yes , this really is ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the backing @-@ independent approach , therefore the actual question is what media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 @-@ de , En@@ ter key &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. , sink ) . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ding it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ O co@@ dec@@ s that can cause un@@ disturbed playback . read this bug report . read this bug report . the Enh@@ ance of Sound Buff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been highly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
notice that it is not posible to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . run logs in order to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . &quot;
&quot; if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;

this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you &apos;re arous@@ ed by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running track when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this gives you the interpreter and title of the running play : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP D@@ CO@@ P --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ playing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa exists .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . to do this , press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size modi@@ fiable window . &quot;
the combination of Ctr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queu@@ e . pressing the button to search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search result .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the Control bar &apos;s system section ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers should be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME lies on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and the console shows lots of error messages . what now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ ok &apos;s MySQL support .
&quot; place a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic enco@@ ding , you can instead convert files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Q@@ F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous review with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual review on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the evaluation for a piece by yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . there , you can change the evaluation of a piece as well , just by clicking the piece and pressing F@@ 2 . you can also modify the app@@ rais@@ al in the Metad@@ ata dialog . &quot;
developers don &apos;t want you to specify when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE pack@@ ets have a fixed release plan that will not match the short @-@ term scheduled plot of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , but some users can easily find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing down in the general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design install .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while you browse in the kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation pane . then click on the button settings ( top ) , and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bb@@ ler is a free service to the information that are being played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bb@@ ler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supports .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; presum@@ ably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; newly configure and install . &quot;
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you have to install the package g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the error &quot; There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time must also be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will get the error There is no item present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 Stream , but the g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator log @-@ register . then start Amar@@ ok again . &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound@@ card ?
&quot; for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the case dialog of x@@ ine , enter us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick bit@@ map support m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you can of course take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you like , you can become the new so much needed super@@ visor for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be very easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wiz@@ ard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to upgrade your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wiz@@ ard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up a Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; to create a playlist is very simple . drag the mouse to the playlist into the playlist . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it by using the playlist . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it in the playlist window list . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please choose action audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD @-@ pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the playback button . &quot;

&quot; the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on one entry , and follow the burning menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages on a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control .
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok can be used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running piece or the current stream . a click on this area changes the display of the currently playing time to the remaining part of the play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also activated . the PL button is activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting E@@ quali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , volume control and the piece position slider . use the sliders to start playback / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use the ex@@ ali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all multimedia players .
&quot; in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is simple to use and yet even for advanced users performance powerful enough . &quot;
&quot; the context browser features three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . &quot;
&quot; if you have previously used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you might have noticed that the sub@@ windows start off . the information presented here is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information in the statistics window can be viewed ( ex@@ tras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and beside it a Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to see the piece in the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the images can have any names , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the tracks there are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the interpreter , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work up and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
&quot; you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button , and then select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the text for writing scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is not yet any text script , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing performer - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Performer - your pieces are sorted first by genre and below them by interpre@@ ters .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Performer / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album under the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you have a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
right under the tool@@ bar you find a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . you can find hints for using this filter in the section about the playlist in this manual .
&quot; below the search filter is a selection panel that allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection , from the last 24 hours up to a year . besides , you can of course select your entire collection , which makes the filter virtually shut off . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options . &quot;
load - This le@@ ases the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function inserts the selected pieces into the queu@@ e . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer the pieces into the queu@@ e to transfer to the media player . for more details see the Media @-@ Player @-@ Browser section .
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn on CD - Therefore the selected pieces will be broadcast to K@@ 3@@ b and either burned as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( N ) move files into the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer ... - opens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selection - Select the selected album as compilation , after which it appears under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the album will no longer be shown under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the respective interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the playlist browser makes handling many play@@ lists easy . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; you can also add smart play@@ lists created by yourself . click on Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Intel@@ ligent playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ windows media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e. g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you &apos;ll need to retri@@ eve pieces on your iPod to interpre@@ t in the top list view of the Media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and leave them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . &quot;
under the tool@@ bar you find a search area where you can search for a file . search is particularly useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z input and press En@@ ter , you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop it . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply drop @-@ down . in this case , dropped files can be added automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired place . to reset the filter , just press the pieces that contain the characters . to reset the filter , press the back key until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter into entries separate search terms , you will find Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter for example one two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain whit@@ esp@@ ace , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular keyword , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variations at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment .
&quot; you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click on the entries in the desired order . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are reproduced . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you &apos;ll find the Add button to add to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , follow the buttons undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar , there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be set to the Analy@@ zer by clicking the right mouse button . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the player window above the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more buttons available for tool@@ bars , for example playback control and volume control . &quot;
&quot; the status bar displays a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . &quot;
you can also hide the status bar . disable the status bar option in general settings .
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . &quot;
one click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plugins . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; behind this entry , there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images .
the cover administration includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queu@@ es management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . once you &apos;ve set a piece in the queu@@ e , the playlist will appear in the list next to the title . this number represents the order in which the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; when you want to add a piece to the queu@@ e , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queu@@ e administration . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details to set up these will follow later ) . &quot;
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bb@@ ler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select load . &quot;
&quot; the two selected Mo@@ di Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix instantly fill in your playlist , and you can add at least one piece even from your collection . the suggested pieces are added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;
the New button re@@ fills the current playlist and adds new pieces corresponding to the dynamic mode . playlist Edit opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist you have the ability to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for incoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not be double in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed under observation of the songs played . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played play . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right @-@ hand side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click Con@@ figuration .
&quot; you can install new and Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking on script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet . &quot;

&quot; includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it as if you had called a close @-@ up file . &quot;
&quot; if you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are entering the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the &quot; Burn &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described by the right mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . it is useful for you to view files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium . &quot;
&quot; this function causes only an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only displays the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later on . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD which you want to burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; you can also create a DVD copy to another medium without project file . alternatively , you can also create a DVD copy to another medium . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will delete the contents completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing mod@@ i over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not currently supported , you have to use other tools such as nos g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the selected video , enco@@ der settings , and even ways to change the size and to cut black margins . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars at &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will appear in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and un@@ locking the drive or throwing the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a nar@@ rower range , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to modify the keyboard assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wiz@@ ard . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work right away . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the D@@ CO@@ P command line or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive , which of the accompanying programs will give you preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you are using the D@@ CO@@ P command line . to be able to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; start . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Aus@@ les@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and saved in mp3 or OGG files . also , other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the machine . &quot;
&quot; currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gi@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) is supported by default ( This enco@@ der package must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or even in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . just avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called as often as a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim base of the user interface , which will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step example , you will find further information about how this program is used as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; start the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - when an enco@@ der was configured in the enco@@ ding settings tab in the setup catalog - enco@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read as the default . it is important to note that previously the enco@@ der was configured in the enco@@ ding settings tab in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; open the file manager , so that an already read file will be selected for enco@@ ding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; open the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ages ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; open the main entry dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as Enco@@ der , to set the Enco@@ der ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes tone quality , enco@@ der and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right co@@ dec . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &quot; &quot; shor@@ ten &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; monkey &quot; , &quot; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rati@@ os and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may nowadays have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + high to very high audio quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to og@@ g slightly deeper quality in lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG cutting devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - in the beginning of 2009 , these devices usually only support MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable visibility for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music from you@@ ths , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ os . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ S@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ der program to create folder and file names , as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
in connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button in the wiz@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of themselves into the computer . it is important to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I ( referring to the editor : that &apos;s the author ) bin no attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music business can be ma@@ stered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address than that in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This may only know the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the geographical closest to the nearest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online recall of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) just the updates of the database .
which audio program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD . &quot;
&quot; for the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be selected on the tab card to set up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab yourself . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ der . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher enco@@ der .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get further information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gi@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
&quot; check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD . to do so , check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed ! &quot;
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 bit@@ ters ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have typ@@ ed typ@@ ed on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes how to proceed to read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with each reading of a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD / DVD drive can be accessed , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of device desig@@ nations for CD @-@ ROM and / or DVD drives helps . &quot;
the card list Over@@ all settings . here is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is as am@@ ended / typ@@ ed as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
&quot; only select for incomplete information , so that you will be informed if information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card file CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
&quot; note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during the reading of the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot;
&quot; the second drop @-@ down box is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , then disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is about 620 MB . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , you &apos;ll need to select the first one , at least the first . mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to Fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you .
&quot; both work equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should be sufficient . &quot;
just take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the / tmp file exists on your computer )
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check out this to the &amp; CD ; throw it out at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you select this , then / / the path / folder can be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the scre@@ enshot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something needs to be bled to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ cting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files simultaneously enco@@ ding : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time .
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD comes ; we will create and set MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet is set up , as we are comfortable and the CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is set up . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data fet@@ ched for a &amp; CD . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not been done yet , the &amp; CD now has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; if this does not happen , then look for questions and answers to the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; there is a window displayed , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next scre@@ enshot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Current Title &apos; field , unless you have compiled a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower commentary box can be used for individual comments as am@@ edi@@ as per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retrieval of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the files produced later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously coinci@@ des with the style of the selected CD ; in this example this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are to find under skir@@ t .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown on the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or select the button Select All the pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the selection process by clicking on the selection button , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and follow what runs out . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is being read straight to the hard drive . the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error if you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . this enables reading and enco@@ ding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
&quot; now the last song is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queu@@ e of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; some of the most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to people compiled from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how to adapt the program to your needs once it &apos;s running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs has many options on settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen shots of the different card types of settings and also includes comments for options , which are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still am reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any indication of how to proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot keep this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator .
&quot; strange , if you succeeded in fet@@ ching the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kara@@ oke Player by &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , it also has some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver supported for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with varying color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows can move to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can choose the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playing in the tool@@ bar , select the item playing from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played after each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator back and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and adjust the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears as a pressure on the button Pause , or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces do not have any text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what happ@@ enings are to be displayed , and even better : the event type is automatically selected using a song , so you don &apos;t have to manually set up a kar@@ a@@ oke text . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , choose from the menu Settings the entries text events or song events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . in this section , you can see how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the respective wished in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection takes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the Autom@@ atically Add to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are not enabled by Autom@@ atically add to the collection , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row from the menu collections from the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to continue jumping a song , select Next song , next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the Previous piece button , select the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be saved and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it will not be saved while leaving . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events translate into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all the events of Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM radio devices etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so , you must edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . &quot;
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D define key@@ map &quot; A more key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D define CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that define is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer devices that are not General MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section shows how to display General MIDI Pat@@ ches to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also not leave line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to create all tones that this instrument needs to stack on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , you can wear a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which is similar to a gun type . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here the term &quot; &quot; drum patch &quot; &quot; refers to a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; like the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used primarily to map sounds on the percussion channel . look at the key@@ maps provided for example .
&quot; this section can be used to map a number of channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply do this in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need 16 or 9 channels ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section thus has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored which attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the percus@@ sions patch on the percussion channel .
&quot; the value for pitch ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then first for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the Map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM speci@@ fies that a keyboard , which receives a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a tone higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try walking around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are just played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the kno@@ b does not illumin@@ ate any more green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . view the menu Settings under the Point Channel view : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without additional AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ agree , so support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . &quot;
&quot; first , activate the Autom@@ atically Add to Collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double click on the LCD . &quot;
&quot; I have a &amp; k@@ de ; work surface open &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; Windows with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or block ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) , I need to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or window , and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file only once , without adding them to a collection , turn the Autom@@ atically Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. Zu@@ end you just want to play the first file . so , set the Autom@@ atically Add to the collection and open it a.@@ mi@@ d. Your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ in , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you all ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;

a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends greatly on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter , it runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can of course not listen to any music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; the program is used to play video files from MP@@ layer or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , VCD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help please check the site The K@@ DE Website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed if information is reproduced in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Defini@@ tive Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you have an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and long @-@ term playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the Comp@@ are menu with the playlist and select either mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the editing mode or another group is selected without comparing the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation on startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be distur@@ bing at the end animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite portrait : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are the by &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; supported .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing MP@@ layer in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; . here the path from the MP@@ layer and the cache size of the data stream can be set out of the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ MP@@ layer . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; . everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c . here is an example of how a &quot; flash &quot; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; it can even add the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; thus , the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer module must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignment of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end for a given M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done through manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; and K@@ MP@@ layer ; can play cards from TV , either using MP@@ layer or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) settings in the K@@ MP@@ layer , the dialogue in the settings can be found in - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ e- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . the enco@@ ding must be found ( for example it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of K@@ MP@@ layer can only use X@@ Video , X@@ video should also work ( probably this kind of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ linux has to be functional in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) : &quot;
&quot; internal are used by K@@ MP@@ layer for the sources different names . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ oc , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , url@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d@@ source . &quot;
there are hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not by the VCD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is root to run after the device has been plug@@ ged in . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom lets you on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; K@@ ile ;
latex ; : a professional typ@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems is probably used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; K@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the K@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the K@@ ile website should be established . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or if you are comp@@ iling &amp; K@@ ile , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; work surface . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wiz@@ ard , the L@@ atex ; Reference and powerful project management have to be called . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to learn about its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be drawn up . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can begin directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; latex ; is the right balance : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the prim@@ eval &amp; tex is difficult to use , it can also use a lay@@ ie ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; latex ; mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the \ \ end { document } command . &quot;
the Quick Start Assistant from &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the Wiz@@ ard option ( menu ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . you can also set some settings related to the document .
&quot; document categories : hereby the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projec@@ tor &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined . &quot;
enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding code is set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for proper processing of the latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for latex .
&quot; articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; K@@ ile , an empty line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) will automatically create a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu Mode ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into several elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; latex , files may be very helpful . once a DVI file ( file e V ice I n@@ dependent File ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; K@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button on the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as font and is beside PDF the physical output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and expor@@ ting DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; with the use of the return search , the elements of the DVI file , file with the editor and once cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI file , is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; latex ; -@@ source code was cli@@ cked , the corresponding point in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is spec@@ ulated . &quot;
master @-@ document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project preferences .
quick construction : the L@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI file is displayed on both sides and is not a call from &amp; ok@@ ular ; after the fast construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields were designed for quick introduction of common elements into the document . &quot;
&quot; the further information is available for items such as tags , notes notes or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection box possible ) .
&quot; when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; manually . &quot;
&quot; the last selection field with the name of GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ Ã ¤ e is used for the definition of the font sizes . it can be specified for the main text , the joint notes etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; K@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the ground up by hand . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code sample has been entered , the L@@ atex ; source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is to use the men@@ Ã ¼ s build or the button of quick construction . &quot;
the source code must be stored before compile . &amp; K@@ ile ; the storage is automatically generated .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document is out of place , it should be sought after the errors . when using fast @-@ construction , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the remain@@ der of the document .
the changes are only monitored within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restrictions ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , gre@@ ase pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ str@@ ations etc. can be added . these commands either end with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ c pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language is presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text has been entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments should be made for better read@@ ability of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , editor View or Ctr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the window needs to be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; this files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as needed for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed with file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI file into other formats . once the DVI file , file from the &amp; latex ; source text was created , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pre @-@ search function allows the direct jump from the editor to the related position within the DVI file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; latex .
&quot; in order to select the desired search , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a line of the source text and then be cli@@ cked on previous search . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer will then take place . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button on the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; latex ; file from &amp; K@@ ile ; opened and set to the corresponding line . this must be set as text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; if there is an error , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file indicates the error source in the source code . in the editor , the list of previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and errors can be used between errors . &quot;
&quot; once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pre @-@ set options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting Le@@ er Document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wiz@@ ard can be used for quick creation of a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; user of &amp; latex ; mostly use the same introduc@@ tions for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file can be opened or created a new file . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings may be replaced with other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... Settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings to be replaced by which variables : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps must be executed :
&quot; when creating a new document , the template can be selected instead of the default def@@ aults . &quot;
a template can be created from any &apos; latex &apos; file . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; kate ; as internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and editing of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; kate ; can be done in the menu items directly from &amp; K@@ ile .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to learn his possibilities , the manual to Kate should be drawn up . users from &amp; K@@ ile ; can begin directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical and latex ; command reference , which can be called via the menu La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all the commands that can be found in &amp; latex , and their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed Ctr@@ l key to select the word . this means that clicking the \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to search the most different kinds of source texts and emphasize them . for example , latex ; commands differ from normal text and also mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many wiz@@ ards can inv@@ ent additional spr@@ ing@@ brands . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu items marked jump marks , or the corresponding button keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; K@@ ile ; . although &amp; kate ; already excellent possibilities , have been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; key features for writing a &amp; latex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit elect , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; insert a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , and latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this is the only predic@@ tive thing in &amp; K@@ ile ; it is that the gaps are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this option also has an extended meaning , since this command also has an extended meaning , as this command also lashes out ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides the key Ctr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers with its own commands for faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit elect paragraph .
it has already been indicated that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore it provides &amp; K@@ ile ; for further orders under editing environment for a balanced simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the surroundings .
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the closing position of the environment . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or inside the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; during the input of many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command will close the most recently opened surroundings , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; also offers special commands for the L@@ atex ; groups defined by brackets { ... } . among Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands , which correspond to those from editing environment . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded clamp .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , it will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the input of many ne@@ sted welded group @-@ cl@@ as@@ ps , the overview can quickly be lost . this command does not close the recently opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be broken . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; latex ; two simple suits are used as GÃ ¤ n@@ ants . for the appropriate implementation , the sign &quot; is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple suits . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double anch@@ oring marks can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; there are also specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) , so German or French suits are used . many other languages are also available . &quot;
&quot; when pressing Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e. g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not only a line break but also the \ \ item command . &quot;
within a spread@@ sheet Cl@@ ose Cl@@ ose &amp; K@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break .
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or customized environments .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other .
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already offering a good source code completion , this in &amp; K@@ ile has been extended . three different modes are built . all of these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings K@@ ile ... can be set up . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , a new environment is created using the \ \ begin { environment } command ; automatically adds the \ \ end { environment } command after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last character of the input will be removed and the complete list will be enlarged . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , from &amp; K@@ ile ; also jump stamps can be set , so that an easy jump to these positions can be set via Edit J@@ umping token N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ est jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be frozen . &quot;
&quot; under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; All can be done on these lists . there may be different bet@@ ting lists for tex , - and &amp; latex ; commands as well as bet@@ ting boxes of the common language used . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . on the other hand , a few letters with \ \ begin will have to be entered . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for processing environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the completion mode over the menu Edit setting or the key Alt + Shift key space bar , the command to open the environment will automatically be m@@ ated and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and be completed by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; K@@ ile ; realize that it is a lists neighborhood , even a first \ \ item command will be added . &quot;
under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; All can be done on these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ liste of Over@@ self @-@ Dam@@ age Mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl serves as an example of the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word takes place over the menu item , or the Ctr@@ l + Alt space key is introduced , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many che@@ eses in one document are written more than once . &quot;
this mode can be set up in the menu Mode ... K@@ ile consum@@ able . here you can also set the threshold value for displaying the completion .
&quot; the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / the Pers@@ Ã ¶ n@@ lichen Home folder , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ er@@ buch ) , or tex . &quot;
the dialogue graphics design the inser@@ tion of graphics as simple as possible . to the super@@ vis@@ ing of the basics about the graphics formats the sections should be taken into consideration .
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to view the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all tools are group@@ ed group@@ ed into the menu Cre@@ ating comp@@ iling , creating conversion and creating view . &quot;
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; ok@@ ular ; or the further conversion can be used the key Alt ; 2 . then the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
&quot; when using the Quick Building instruction , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will be opened every time . &quot;
a new project is about the project New Project .... here@@ with the following information is being asked for the project :
&quot; when selecting the file name -@@ window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function by &amp; K@@ ile ; allows you to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed over scripts in vertical bars .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in further versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
&quot; first , it must be said that the export environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) has the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; latex ; is a well @-@ balanced system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aids for supporting users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are shipped with many documents . it contains a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; latex ; reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) , and is thus ideal for searching for a particular format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; K@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as a possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the documents supplied and there@@ for a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or stro@@ kes . von &amp; K@@ ile ; then only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space of space key opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly , latex ; - / tex ; source code editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; work space environment is also available . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who are looking for the progress of the &amp; K@@ ile ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use under consideration of the GNU license . &quot;

&quot; &amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sign@@ atures for e @-@ mails . using the command line interface , you can create random sign@@ atures or daily sign@@ atures from a list . this command line interface provides the sign@@ atures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . &quot;
&quot; for random sign@@ atures , any signature is from the signature file of &amp; sig ; read out . through many sign@@ atures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day sign@@ atures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; sig for the whole day . for each day you use different sign@@ atures , as with the random sign@@ atures , you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select Ctr@@ l ; N File New . &quot;
you can create as many sign@@ atures as you like . then you have a list of sign@@ atures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally ; there are always enough sign@@ atures .
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross remove in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the User defined button at the bottom of the button , and enter the new short@@ wave by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; for the use of &amp; sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signature to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command . &quot;

&quot; anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s lift it one piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal , simply cli@@ cked the symbol for the XML @-@ Proc@@ essor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application a@@ waiting a index.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if you do not , then remove the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of up @-@ to @-@ date working folders and enter the folder desired in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it .
&quot; if the newly opened file index.@@ doc@@ book is , then you can simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where you will find index.@@ doc@@ book . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported bugs and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; , then you can simply tick the current file . if not , delete the tick and select the file to be checked by another file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ Form@@ ed Test selection . &quot;
for the use of a DT@@ D ; that is specified in the &amp; XML ; file they select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) ; otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the DT@@ D ; with definition UR@@ I ; file selection .
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then you can simply select current file . if not , remove the selection of the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should be named . the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . as a result , the plug @-@ in system will instantly benefit and do not have to wait until someone builds the wished in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start editing with the menu plug @-@ in . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog enables you to manage all the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to searching the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several people work in a hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the button as pressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitudes of one &apos;s own identity are important with regard to news and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage through recording the members of the team : there can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event promotions are actions that will be executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be to record the opening and closing of the project , so that later on how much someone worked about it or sending a message when a file is added to CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; on the Event Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
&quot; input notes is simple . it can either be chosen from the editor context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword will be entered in a comment area followed by comment text . &quot;
&quot; in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nickname of the nickname of the team member , should be given the appropriate range or sub@@ project names , as shown in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the comment null . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the other can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends over a few pages that will be treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed .
&quot; tags : large / cap@@ itali@@ zation of tags : large / cap@@ itali@@ zation of automatically inserted tags . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as described in the tag XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; automatically close the tag : if you tick , will be inserted for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this is immediately after the &amp; gt ; &quot;
not include optional tag : as above for all other tags except for easy tags .
&quot; start and finish tag automatically refres@@ h : when switched on , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate enco@@ ding during ti@@ pping .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for identifying different types of files . by pressing the default button the default values can be restored .
&quot; default character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting is shown by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D will be used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is moved from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regular backup copies , so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power failure or crash when the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings to the default back to the next start is useful when the user interface has per@@ v@@ aded by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages section allows you to control the display of war@@ nings by hooks of no more queries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ SOP and source code view in shared mode . regarding the different modes see .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse @-@ click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action sol@@ dered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the structure tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in changing the structure tree will be opened automatically . empty k@@ not are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are such , in which no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ b abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be given : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a standard site like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is handed over to the plugin , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Only L@@ esis &quot; &quot; mode load : check if the plugin is denied loading . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually deny loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : if this is checked , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the entered information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implement@@ ations of plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . using the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is usually displayed in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will trigger the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened , which requires a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ gen &apos;s session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this request will be displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
&quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens while the script is stopped , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; assign@@ s the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without inform@@ ing the variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution will start as soon as a request is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or includes any includes .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and includes any errors . &quot;
&quot; assign@@ s the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over the instruction and go to the next , as if there were not the current ones . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set . &quot;

&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag shows . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tool bars enable quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without the risk of a writing error . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the descri@@ b@@ tion language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is outlined in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing but element type over itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the method method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
&quot; if yes , the Tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . in addition , there are other tags describing how to display this attribute , &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to obtain source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = D@@ CO@@ P , a editing and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container @-@ tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description only once . it is a single element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text in a dialog within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements allowed inside the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; Statement : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything but watch &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this should not cause leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is in the top in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and checks Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check is only done when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; character _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
&quot; the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for it , re@@ achable via DT@@ D adap@@ te DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = contact 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . click New Action to the same dialog :
&quot; the short@@ cut short@@ cut of this action . by clicking the User defined button , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current keyboard short@@ cut is removable . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves are the quick start dialog or the different See in ... A@@ ctions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . View this way : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % p@@ id : is replaced with the PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; by the external script . &quot;
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only meaningful with this setting .
&quot; there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages sent to the standard error message . it can be specified , which is to be done with the text written to the standard output , by adjusting the value of the output box : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure action . select Pre@@ ferences . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; &quot; when available , so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
W@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be associated with the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ lic@@ ant button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions for tool@@ bar , or you should set them to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups . make sure the tool@@ bar you want is selected . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the proper folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . &quot;
perhaps the most mentioned extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search for an existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc . &quot;
&quot; func@@ 1 , func@@ 2 , func@@ 2 , func@@ 1 , func@@ 1 , func@@ 2 , # Sec@@ 2.@@ html Section 2 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.3 Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.3 Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.3 Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example you can now see in the &amp; PHP documentation :
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = Langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything but watch &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources are replaced .
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . by selecting the function name and pressing Ctr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection rows . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now , you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to use the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the lost resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or anyone else . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be promp@@ ted for your private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields have to be filled ( URL preview may remain empty ) and clicking OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and Script tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is supported to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package , but the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in the tag XML format . there is the simpl@@ est way to convert a DT@@ D to a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and conver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; Doc@@ type Defini@@ tion@@ line : the string that will appear in the &quot; &quot; Doc@@ type tag &quot; , &quot; as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand these and to be able to understand the full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; using , available , from tool bars over actions is all that is marked as global , in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements are a personal collection of web development remedies for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which means the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ pane , the Building In@@ sights , the Cart@@ ridge with information and the tool@@ bar . please hit in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all card tra@@ il@@ ders , re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu concerning the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editing window , the tool@@ bar of the editor is located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional is used as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars will be displayed . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and the related user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click the symbol that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog boxes . &quot;
&quot; the building man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with card readers are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building man@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as Add , Rem@@ ove , Up@@ load or Del@@ ete the files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used .
&quot; here you can find information about the scrip@@ ting languages available . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works also here . clicking with the left mouse button lets you access the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document to the position of the element . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears below the other building man@@ ners . with it , you can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces , which allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two boxes at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . tool@@ bars are the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar by e @-@ mail .
&quot; in order to get a complete list of all options , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not run here . &quot;
&quot; if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure this is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us started to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ? well , this would make it the most powerful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this , be the appropriate &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of why developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be extended almost every task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development , and has quickly become a mature editor with many powerful features . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers released the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more detailed documentation , help : / Qu@@ anta ( either enter this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a fast access list of files you have opened . this list is changing every time you open a file that is not located , and the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; exp@@ ul@@ sion , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
convert the text from the clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ Description that is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
enables you to select text blocks using the Shift ; key .
directly to a line number . this is very useful when your &amp; PHP comes with error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
turn on and off the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that might be there . that allows , for example , copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details .
load a project tool bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be saved by setting actions . tool@@ bars are saved using tool@@ bar tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you exit whether you want to save the tool@@ bar .
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
&quot; enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . &quot;
load a DT@@ D ; which you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own sound format .
&quot; loading / refres@@ h the entities from the DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is globally and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not available , the store will fail . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags file followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using tool bar is denied if this day at this place contra@@ di@@ cts the rules .
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the menu items above . click activate it . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ b@@ als schem@@ ata depends on the kate ; version .
&quot; very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching time may need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card holder mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ windows mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
enables indication of the status bar at the bottom of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
&quot; set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , you can find details . &quot;
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which can add and change the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help according to the context of the mouse cur@@ sor , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as for example after completing the project name , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ y ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ e. ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project , and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ vers@@ ed scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is started from scratch , if a project is started from scratch . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to your man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard includes three settings that simplify your work .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) that are re @-@ read for project related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to the above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project opens , can read more about project views . &quot;
now only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case the bug hunting is described .
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by showing its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the Team Con@@ figuration dialog , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as viewing a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open . this behavior cannot be influenced at present . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project file ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes prior to leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project management team gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the entries need to be opened and opened with ... in the context menu with the right mouse button : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the files to be uploaded . see . &quot;
&quot; to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgot at the end of the program . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather uns@@ afe password on the disk storage option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work .
&quot; the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply swa@@ ying view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened , opened or deleted within the project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which you can do the most . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best way to create tool@@ bars using the menu Tool@@ bar .
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can be removed , tool@@ bar ren@@ aming or tool@@ bars can be executed , where you can specify which actions to be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional actions will be removed and action is displayed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool bars ... and set settings actions .
&quot; templates have basically a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or combine any existing directory in the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before using exactly .
binary templates are usually added in documents using im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l . some examples are usually found in templates using im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l .
&quot; documents can be created from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents .
&quot; as the name says , these templates for whole websites serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to Beli@@ eving ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As template Save As a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this has been done , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As Sav@@ ing Save Selection as Local / Project Template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : only copy the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as drag and drop or insert the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files , you can click on a folder on the right and create site template , choose a name for the template and secure a name for the template , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend he@@ aders or foot@@ ers or combine dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid out in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click the template with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would be disabled in this path unless it appears explicitly . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you probably will find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
allows pre@@ defined or rep@@ lic@@ ited text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode will replace the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; - page and a cur@@ sor appears .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol indicates the V@@ oh@@ and@@ eal of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; in order to edit it , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes are both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 mode is activated , this mode is activated by pressing the active cur@@ sor from a window to another , with maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta .
&quot; if you want to change the title of the website , you can select the document properties . thus , the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the manual enco@@ ding . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows you to change the content , e.g. key words on the column names and keyword keyword 2 on the Content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS styl@@ es@@ he@@ et by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is possible as in a text processing , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is beha@@ ved stran@@ gely . the marker works as usual . text can be inserted through ti@@ pping and deleted by means of re@@ trac@@ table or remot@@ ely key . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags should not be removed , for example , if an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other round anchor tag must be removed . &quot;
some tool bars such as the Table Assistant or the Listen @-@ Assistent are disabled . they will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style sheets can be pursued . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , you need besides &amp; k@@ de ; the libraries are lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation by &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db Comp@@ ati@@ bility mode , orph@@ aned stops can be set in a specific file and line number and be activated later . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is loaded , for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ sl , the following input is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a prec@@ urs@@ or named QNA@@ P@@ cloud or a specified model name will be checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud containing the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL code file . x@@ sl : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; added to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stops must be termin@@ ated for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this will automatically be re @-@ checked when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops will be re @-@ examined shortly after the start of each run .

output &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ ts ; nbsp ; nbsp ; nbsp ; ( In the &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ gt ; may only be used the file : / / -@@ protocol . this is converted into a correct file name for the operating system )
&quot; if a value is specified for the search@@ results option , all output files are stored in this folder . otherwise , search@@ results will be used by search@@ .@@ x@@ sl , with the option &quot; pre@@ fre@@ html &quot; will be used search@@ ht@@ ml@@ .@@ x@@ sl . &quot;
&quot; if the search term is executed , a x@@ ml file called search@@ resul@@ ts@@ .@@ x@@ ml is created . this file can then be processed with a custom style template to show the data in another form , if the option &quot; &quot; predic@@ .html &quot; &quot; is not set , the search@@ results file will appear . &quot;

&quot; on systems with ready @-@ to @-@ use read@@ line library , you can use the arrow keys to scroll through the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the commands executed so far . &quot;
&quot; multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to give composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; &quot; as an argument , a stop is set in a file named &quot; &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; . &quot; &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template containing only the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name like &quot; x@@ sl : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
&quot; fil@@ ename : a valid local fil@@ ename on the user &apos;s system . in Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . on R@@ IS@@ C OS systems other environment variables are also allowed . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what was changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white signs . later a lot of other useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it into one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was comparing and mer@@ ging folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file @-@ browser .
&quot; in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three source files when comp@@ iling : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps in comparing and mer@@ ging complete folders . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check coding , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one row , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the ti@@ p@@ par@@ ting easier by simply writing the fil@@ ename of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; the Microsoft Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than &quot; &quot; Medium &quot; &quot; ( default setting ) . &quot;
&quot; open dialog enables manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; via the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the match or merge of folders is introduced . if a file is selected for A and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other folders . &quot;
&quot; if coll@@ isions are checked , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparative window . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop : drag a file from a file manager , or select text from an editor , and drop it over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d just need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 . now you can simply copy , paste and compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can do nothing out of diff@@ use ; only the drop @-@ down of text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the information line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional . ) E@@ very info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse to rest over the line . then a small relief pane will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed using the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , you can see the color of which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good to see . &quot;
&quot; when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comment@@ aries , for pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separ@@ ating the summary side from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file does not have lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the results window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; Change &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is gra@@ yed out ! ! ! ( use the jumps to the next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source . this text appears neither in the final file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge file ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white notes . &quot;
&quot; navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , high , down , side up , Ctr@@ l @-@ Start and Ctr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the Insert button , you can switch between insert and over @-@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . ) &quot;
one click with left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ Down / Ctr@@ l @-@ Up ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ Down / Ctr@@ l @-@ Up ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ Down / Ctr@@ l @-@ Up ) . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l Insert ) . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use default backup + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , so you should not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and list of the most recently used files will automatically be saved while loading and restored to the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ o@@ unded . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically creates an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , the respective number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press En@@ ter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the preceding row will be used automatically for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; the second step compar@@ es each line . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white signs are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others only store a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white notes . &quot;
&quot; intensively searching for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in auto @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters in many files are less important . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the options Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
&quot; these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . for details see documentation , compare list compare and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , then the original version will have the suff@@ ix .@@ orig . if such backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ orig , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; change the language of the user interface . change this option does not apply to the currently running program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and rest@@ art , so that the change becomes active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is globally adjusted via the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
&quot; customize the file coding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since enco@@ ding is individually configur@@ able for each file , even files can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding to save to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the default command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the enco@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
turn this down to supp@@ ress changes in white notes in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments are activated . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded over@@ sight column . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply send the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then commit ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ ename of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only for line alignment . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . each input line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient . &quot;
use this command for line synchron@@ ization to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a result of the found text in the first clause . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
&quot; all follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ . now , a pre @-@ processing command for line alignment needs to be changed ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . so , a pre @-@ processing command for line alignment needs to be changed : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 .
sometimes you may want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . other operations only alter the data that the line balance algorithm sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case you destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adapt the proposal before the start .
... can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and shows simul@@ ated changes without actually performing it ;
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ;
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you only need to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that were compared to that time are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is finished , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and folder that was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or double click on the object or by opening the arrow keys to the left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you double click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the name icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the picture above , in columns A / B / C colours red , green , yellow and black are used . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders the age is in@@ significant for its color .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if there exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; a and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized , then choose the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; directly after merge copy &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) is enabled , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. If such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders may not be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , one file will be processed after the other . it shows skill if the merge operation was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected happens . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected in the Setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the particular selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge operations ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then the three @-@ folder merge mode is used as the destination , and B is chosen as destination for two folder merge operation and for synchron@@ ising A and / or B will be used as destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries , select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to run only the current item , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if the conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears to indicate the faul@@ ty elements . they can then select a valid promotion for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options Durch@@ gehen , Sim@@ ulating and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; choose Sim@@ ulate , if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select / continue directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . &quot;
&quot; when you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem or to solve the problem in another way before proce@@ eding with merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually merged , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) do not return . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as dealt with again . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) has now a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that fit the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders don &apos;t have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern will not appear in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern will not appear in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ ally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this file @-@ specific can be specified with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hidden attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a prec@@ urs@@ or dot indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to files : if the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : if the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively searches . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; similar to the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered as identical if they are equal in size . this can , for example , be useful when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is turned off in default . &quot;
activ@@ ates the Synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode the proposals for mer@@ ging files will be selected so that both folders are identical .
&quot; if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the newer file will be suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified either . ) This option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be ren@@ amed and will get the extension .@@ original if an old backup file with the .@@ original extension already exists , this will also affect the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire files . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge @-@ view remains visible in the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also directly merge a file directly without launching the folder merge . once you save the result , the status will be set up , and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders for opening up on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the authori@@ z@@ ations or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ part display from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 takes ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then , removes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch will start to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and choose Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merge or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by watching the sources of other programs .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not provided the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white mark is different , the line will appear as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the evidence of this is more often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor not@@ ices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file , and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information . &quot;
&quot; the effort for this has been too big so far . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c wins ; released and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and lack the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; in order to be able to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how you can use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; cut out ( Ctr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) to the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( Ctr@@ l @-@ V or Shift Inser@@ ted ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position , resp@@ . replaces the current marker . &quot;
&quot; show only differences : files identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the actu@@ alization function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries showing differences are displayed . this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merge . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the inscription A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white notes . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has only the two entries to set up ... and termin@@ ates . however , if you click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu will display only the two entries of the application as well as the entries minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , On Desktop and Finish . the following commands cause the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other areas of work . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . if it is inter@@ cep@@ ted with name , the names are marked with folder numbers , and eg ; 1st desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs will appear as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to enable them to be selected . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : pixel is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; in a 2x@@ n grid , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear in a horizontal and vertical line in a horizontal row , which is very good for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move the windows as symbols or with their content . it also runs outside the control bar .

&quot; this application is interesting for various users : artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly expanding for new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers . &quot;
&quot; if you start &amp; k@@ like ; a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called the magni@@ fying window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is designated as a drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , the area around the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ not ; to indicate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor position . please note that the mouse cur@@ sor is not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; Shift key in addition , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ down window remains firmly and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save into a file , copy it into the clip@@ board ( in order to add it later to other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
stop or stops updating the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will appear . the selected area will appear in a window .
&quot; automatically re@@ load your inserted short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document once again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ lar@@ ging and sh@@ red@@ ding &amp; etc . &quot;
may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier ; you can use a screen magni@@ fier . this application is used for different people of use : from research or artist to web designer or visual handic@@ apped .

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ si@@ sts for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which every mouse click causes pain . &quot;
&quot; it is intended to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome , and that every mouse @-@ click suff@@ ers pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; do you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer . suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : even though &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and execute a mouse click as soon as you break the movement shortly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse button . move now the mouse , wait until the mouse button is pressed . the intelligent move requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
&quot; this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when the mouse button is locked , the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button is waiting , before it releases the mouse button again , when no moving of the mouse takes place . &quot;
&quot; this moves are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slider Sound Buff@@ ers that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , becomes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there . &quot;
&quot; set all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last press release . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , you should first disable the intelligent move . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later use the intelligent push @-@ button . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times from &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware at which places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link leads to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to pull out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . they are located on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or the finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when an im@@ position is started . if you use the intelligent move in this case , this means that you can stop the operation anymore by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you can make a click of the mouse yourself . by this , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try to execute &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another position . &quot;
use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input .
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent move is an advanced feature of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to copy text , paste it into the clip@@ board or execute any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice on it : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text instead : execute a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . thus , each time &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but to do so , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use , the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X windows must be installed . this should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and set them correctly .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor is short .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping with the mouse can also be done . &quot;
&quot; for more detailed user documentation , please help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ( enter either this &amp; URL ; in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or run k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ) . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to talk to their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose phrases that are to be discussed again from a list of the conversation course . &quot;
on the first page of the assistant ( left scre@@ enshot ) enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog@@ s .
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text pas@@ sage@@ book . from the text pas@@ sage@@ books you can often choose used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) , you determine the dictionary for the lex@@ icon . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can compare the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to allow only correctly letter words to be included in the Word of Wor@@ ds . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a course memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
&quot; when you set mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the pro@@ positions you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is app@@ ended to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the word calendar as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card input field , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the enco@@ ding code , with the text to be passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this are listed in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . if this is successful , the further settings will be ignored on this page . if this is successful , the further settings will be available on this page . if this option is successful , the choice of this option is reasonable , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text pas@@ sage@@ book or in the bar for text pas@@ sage@@ books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of instant talk , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the outlet memory . with the selection of into the input field , the selected text passage is initially only entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text pas@@ sage@@ book , you can choose whether the text pas@@ sage@@ book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pas@@ sage@@ book will not be saved . &quot;
&quot; the lex@@ icon page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the translation . in the main window , next to the input field , you can select a selection field if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
select for this source the language you want ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert just correctly written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary without entries . &quot;
the main area of the window to edit text pas@@ sage@@ books is divided into two . in the upper part the text pas@@ sage@@ books are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; you can either add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text pas@@ sage@@ books or text passages by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new place or using the arrow keys and the Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text will be edited and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , this will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , this will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar is displayed using buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the c@@ unning left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with cl@@ ues about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text pas@@ sage@@ books with entries . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the c@@ unning left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position . &quot;
probably you do not have the command for voice output correctly or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the map menu . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for more details . )
&quot; at present , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in / usr / local / festival . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports English pron@@ unciation .
&quot; to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ .@@ Language output is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wave file so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ f _ BAR / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input must be on .
the speech @-@ output dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; since the language generator &apos;s setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , let text be issued by the computer . a list of already scann@@ ed sentences will be saved , which the user can spend time and time again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include a voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer a speech syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&quot; - The voice @-@ over@@ s system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module consisting of modules of existing service , allowing each application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ d ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; to voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common usage interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS skills . also the users it offers interesting possibilities . &quot;
&quot; read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; , even if &amp; kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications . &quot;
&quot; speech output takes place via the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .

&quot; in addition to the bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , discussions can be found on &amp; kt@@ at ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list . subscribe can also find the list on https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . &quot;
&quot; before you can use , you need to install and adjust speech disp@@ at@@ cher program . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , the card menu will be displayed . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least use a speaker before you are using the speed disp@@ at@@ cher as the speed disp@@ at@@ cher is otherwise used to the standard speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the cardboard card driver in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card number will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start t@@ m@@ gr and no spokes@@ person is set up . &quot;
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers are listed above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; with one mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with one mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with one mouse click , select a spokes@@ person from the list and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list will also determine their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ d ; system .
&quot; choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ d ; almost use . go back to the map menu and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker configured , you can start the language output system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card@@ holder in general to open this card menu . here you can set up some general options . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card menu will be displayed , and you can make text orders and read the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ m@@ gr is finished , the program runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the reading is finished . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can start , pause , pause and record text orders . &quot;
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the order card orders will only be shown when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , please click on the card driver icon and cross there speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . then check the text that should be read , and select the text editor in the main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; kate ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can notify you about events that you have set up . you can read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ ams .
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the menu Settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags template and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box as it can be accepted as provided in most cases . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ on ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is edited before it will be sent to the speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to select incorrect words or abbrevi@@ ations , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the mode of working of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader is read , the pending jobs will be res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you are reading a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . any order you encounter from the Cart@@ ridge order is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for issu@@ ing longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for issu@@ ing Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such read , this issue will be stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen editing . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters work the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; fon@@ ts replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced may be delivered either as words or as regular expressions , which allow the creation of chat emotions such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , some X@@ S@@ LT files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; you can send jobs depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ at . for example , if you have selected a female voice for example on the card holder , you can read the text of K@@ DE messages . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , he will continue the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be processed by all activated filters placed on the bottom of the page . the filters are processed in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters set up . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following set @-@ up dialog@@ s are displayed below . &quot;
&quot; for setting string enforcement filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it must only be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs are available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only type copies . &quot;
&quot; the filter replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the th@@ eses filter if applicable . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ating characters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&quot; X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such form@@ ulations . however , it can only be applied to shap@@ ely XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card holder , or to a speaker with certain properties . for example , you can specify that text from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; the speaker is selected by the speaker &apos;s properties , which pre@@ prints the program , which defines the text to &amp; kt@@ ts , and the properties of the narr@@ ator established on the board card . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied , if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expression , you can access it by clicking on the button to get help in entering . &quot;
&quot; to get a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the properties of the chosen speaker here . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to show the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the th@@ eses filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; speech @-@ Edition API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the syn@@ thesizer can be used . &quot;

none of the above speech syn@@ thesi@@ zers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ converter filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in the 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ BLE works at all . you must also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found above the environment variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesi@@ zers so that whole sentences ski@@ p over or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch . what can I do about it ?
&quot; first of all , make sure that the character enco@@ ding option is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string attachment filter . see . &quot;

&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza . &quot;
KT@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be launched on the command line in a console .
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , draw the description of the syn@@ thesi@@ zers to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to extend the usage of a different syn@@ thesizer , please contact the developer team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to compile , compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; retri@@ eve , compile and install the source code archive for co@@ de@@ file , or download the tar@@ ball currently created , install and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you are using it , first check whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; and kt@@ d ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ d ; using the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ g should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is possible , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can go back pun@@ ctu@@ ally or alternatively , repeat the output or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , this will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker can be applied . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ h ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you &apos;ll see in . &quot;
&quot; when you click Add Spe@@ aker to Add Spe@@ aker to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card holder will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details on the modules can be found below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival in PAT@@ H is included , you only have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text that is passed to the festival . in voices , which are known , this setting is done automatically . in general , Western languages can be used ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sliders , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when you start K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( on larger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thesi@@ zed faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window t@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of the t@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the icon sli@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section will be visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to read or otherwise control the reading . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card holder . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can proceed or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
clicking OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be changed and kt@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
&quot; if the Sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text orders are listed and managed here . expenses of screen editing , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , selecting and kt@@ ops , either without support for the corresponding audio module , you cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speech velocity here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200 % , about double normal speech speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ on ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices contains all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out which device works with you . in doubt select standard .
&quot; on this card , you can set up special promotions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the issu@@ ance of the Screen Reader has been read , the received orders will be res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
warning messages have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning will keep the output of messages and normal text .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news .
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ d ; the audio output into the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sounds and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and the output of screen editing , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ d ; K@@ not@@ ing news , start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card card will appear al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to disable the read of &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and ok ; read no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ at , will not be read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; sends whenever someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use this drop @-@ down box to specify what to do , if an event occurs . you have the following choices : &quot;
&quot; if you have selected user defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the speaker you want . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the board card spokes@@ person as the top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; notice that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , this will be executed . otherwise , the action will be carried out for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the notification in a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
&quot; you have to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the default voice , the festival in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and regular filters ( S@@ DB @-@ filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds share text in single sentences . thus , you can also start or stop orders on the card menu , as only the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed , not the entire text order . &quot;
&quot; here you see the set limits filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set boundary recognition filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add additional set limits filter , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the subscri@@ ber selection by trying out . switch on the selection of the speakers and select text to read . to do so , you need to have more than one speaker setup , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; and kt@@ at ; then it can start faster with the reading , because only the first set must be processed and not the entire text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the map card , even if the syn@@ thesizer has not supported this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal movement limit@@ er filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , just removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
del@@ im@@ al identi@@ fiers compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ulator mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ular characters are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard set boundary recognition filter keeps the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal movement limit@@ er filter by mistake , you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;

I have downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it at festival but kt@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be able to locate the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zers such as Festival Interactive can offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this function is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored , if &amp; kt@@ d ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) If you are quite brave , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML converter filter , and set up the speech speed . &quot;

the so@@ x audio program is used for the general setting of speech speed but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux CDs .
&quot; have you and kt@@ d ; downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , login as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
&quot; the following modules for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers are created by default , some of them have a run @-@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) . &quot;
&quot; default is &amp; kt@@ d ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target option , for example . &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs translated from the sources . &quot;
the make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ on ; first , check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . in many voices , you can adjust volume , speech velocity and pitch with &amp; kt@@ on . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . to do so , please refer to the instructions provided with the Festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . &quot;
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices you need to enter MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . choose a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
&quot; usually , Festival is included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , please search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the enco@@ ding option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates Language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . Festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German text thi@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . it is necessary either to Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the playing of the error correction is not required , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 votes don &apos;t work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
&quot; this process uses special code to distribute the language about the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and take care of both of them , Festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both of them work . &quot;
un@@ zip the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file must be in your PAT@@ H .

&quot; the Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ph@@ ased voice syn@@ thesizer , which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . look for Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage voice syn@@ thesizer working with Di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text in Di@@ phone and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language syn@@ thesizer gives it the sound . the language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ ename . &quot;
on the card setup folder selection choose a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple speech syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ on ; you can adjust only the volume with this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; select the Czech or Slovak Language and Epo@@ s T@@ TS Language Syn@@ thesizer . if the EP@@ s programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the tab card . enter in one &amp; console ; e@@ pos -@@ h or say -@@ h for more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor speech speed can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ on ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , rather than sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS adjustments . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings across a unified , integrated interface . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu ; . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that , and k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ schema ; the device at all points and allows the setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded if the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the hands @-@ on selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release edge is best . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gray , which means that the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in system management mode , you can enter system management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the Reiter Network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Ri@@ der Network interfaces :
the settings displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button ... set up in the dialog unit .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; when selecting Automatic , TCP / IP settings are obtained from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . &quot;
&quot; using the manual can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address has to be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the network , you can determine if the address you want is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . turn off an out@@ dated network device by selecting the list and clicking the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off as needed . disable an enabled network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
&quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical link to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communications with machines in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain entry through the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls on http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
the calcul@@ ator to the name resolution part of the name tag allows easy management of this list . entries can be added removed or changed . DNS records can be ordered by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list using buttons Hin@@ on or Her@@ mit in priority .
clicking on the button Add ... from the group machine to the nam@@ ing solution can be added a DNS server . it will add the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group machine to the nam@@ ing solution , select one entry and then click the Edit button .... the Edit menu will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the list of well @-@ known hosts describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting , when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of names well @-@ known computers contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known computer has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit ... Edit the ren@@ amed machine is displayed .
&quot; it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately activated in the system . to activate the changes , you have to set the following command . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installing binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool for your distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and k@@ net@@ work@@ c.@@ com. The following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given ; in the second section , all of the configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network will be convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to go through in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is to be allocated to a network interface . in third @-@ party networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact point that uses a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet can be enabled for such machines by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 has its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle . &quot;
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ c.@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content to be found in the case of active DSL links . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the script in Su@@ SE@@ config . another state than expected may therefore occur .

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first one was to create a surface for tar , which provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective packaging . the second goal was to answer a question that asked my wife : how much longer does it take if one sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; sh@@ uts the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the pre@@ tension@@ er on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the invent@@ or , searches for the right index on your disk . if it is not found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band was involved . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before casting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be e@@ jected without any danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it needs to be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be form@@ atted , before you can be used to store data . this process does not match format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive assumes that a tape should be form@@ atted before using it . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require format@@ ting of the tape , DAT runs . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with format@@ ting the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
&quot; once the backup is initiated , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the check@@ out process has been started , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears over@@ look . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the File menu ...
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog appears for Rest@@ ore . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will be rest@@ art@@ ed . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the index file with the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of the band :
&quot; this way , a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings is created . you can set the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current working folder , in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files stored in them are stored on the same fil@@ esystem as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems , you can separate them separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent from the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and create a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files had not yet been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the tape drive for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the command flows load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; locking the tape to the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , it is automatically e@@ jected to the inclusion of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically e@@ ject the tape . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy streams . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to communicate the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape is form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the band has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file named in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat folder .
other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who don &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files . in addition , it enables &amp; ch@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system puts the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , try to provide some advanced functions that can fil@@ tered and evaluated the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 features &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following scre@@ enshot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first of all the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be displayed , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you don &apos;t have permission to read the protocol files under Linux usually in the / var / log , for the normal user usually no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criteri@@ on or string . in the default setting , the list of log messages will be changed automatically , so that only log messages will be displayed next to the filter . &quot;
&quot; you can of course also select another entry at this point . for example , in the protocol file system log the column process , and enter the name of a process in the filter bar , and display all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines .
&quot; if you want to show only a specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command , such as the sam@@ ba server startup . in this case , use filtering strip . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option to new lines in the main window context menu to show all new additions to the log file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; enables displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. You will find more information about the sources of interest of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system is rapidly developing to the standard for control of program start @-@ up in the &amp; Linux world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I do not know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without a re@@ installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial port in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d . &quot;
the kernel is looking in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably note that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can re@@ boot / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . &quot;
&quot; but how do you start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? easy : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually run these scripts by hand on command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will start with the start argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level running only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . additionally , I could have a user run@@ level , that &apos;s &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another line is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or move the position within a level by drag@@ ging it elsewhere . this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the field of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously been in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the number number of an entry cannot be calculated at times . in such a case , you need to edit the sor@@ ption numbers of the surrounding items before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to enable the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move one entry to another run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use Ctr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( using Ctr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the number number or name of an entry manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to change the changes , or press ES@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ es and now the machine is constantly re@@ bo@@ ating . what can I do ?
&quot; enter the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab , and edit the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be al@@ right ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary training programs of these distri@@ butions , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an expansion of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution : please check that all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as htt@@ p@@ d , Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level for this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you have to save them . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the saving in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two kart@@ ing cards , the user &apos;s and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some map cards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . only when you activate space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created where you can set individual settings . additional card cards appear , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd , such as in BSD Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; the password administration map appears , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd , like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; this card card only appears , if for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . &quot;
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field file system with space limitation .
&quot; the card @-@ card group inform@@ s about the group affili@@ ation of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the matching Add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analogue . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ loader , add , remove and modify boot password , add , remove , remove , change , and more . &quot;
