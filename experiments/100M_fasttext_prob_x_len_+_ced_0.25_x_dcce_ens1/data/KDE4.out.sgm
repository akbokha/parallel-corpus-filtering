<seg id="75">"gPhoto2 uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. as photos generally are large files and transfers via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support so that the preview images of digiKam can be read reliably.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to be & digious; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"tipi modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview to develop. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the kipi modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is considerably easier, & digikam; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in & digikam; even carry out."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the side strips with & LMB; or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"dragging and storing pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the Albenbauma, over the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot put into keywords, date list or search."</seg>

<seg id="152">"professional photographers also have other requirements such as versioning images, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different subjects and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% are working files and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content."</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes stacking easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">"we also recommend saving the metadata in & digikam the metadata settings page. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the corresponding item from the Album menu."</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors that you print or publish on the web from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the topic of color management comes, everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results that he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should make informed decisions about how to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow meets all the six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other image output is by e-mail or Web, where sRGB is the de facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB doesn't work so well and makes life for everyone so simple, why should you use another color space and worry about color management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and colours in the sRGB color space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger colour spaces, please visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then click on information about RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calliate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you have to monitor your monitor, since sRGB is based on sRGB. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, you must either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting a further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalizing, comparing, automatic comparing and contrast expand from the menu Correcting Automatic correction try automatically to make the best out of your colors. you'll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scales the luminosity values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out."</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the brightness factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible."</seg>
<seg id="392">"this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a realignment of all values in between.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly limited as a color space with 8-bit per color is worked. so if you can do the white balance in rough mode, which operates in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be customized in size. on the left side you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="398">The thumbnail preview has a red marker. the pixel spacing below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the controls mentioned above, you should use the color temperature pipette. click on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected colour to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"additionally, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Upload buttons do exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you into a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button sets all filter values back to its standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16 bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu under colors tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, so that you always need the same correction and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for toning correction you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the tool colour effects provide you with four color effects, a solar vibration effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar isation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that resulted in a short flash light and followed the development of the image. the coloured, darker areas protected the image of the image. this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"intensity controls the solar power. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photopapers."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and it handles the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a reverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider reps the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to adjust the colour contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can attempt to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / gamma, the tool can be used for the improvement of exposure. even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slide. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph are three sliders into which can be moved and that can be moved to change the brightness values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">"the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the regulator, and take care of how the image changes."</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right you can view the original and preview of the image. preview will be dynamically, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left side are the following options available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: using this selector can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic distribution is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three knobs: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color ppettes can be used in previewing the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright notes. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively, e.g. in the input values. the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a faded image as a background while seeing something else in the foreground."</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatic: with this button, the picture values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the filesystem can be saved and recharged later. for this purpose, the Gimp Levels format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are adjusted automatically for all shadows, middle and sun shades."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you can see an example for the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that changes from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most useful. in this case the linear mode also helps to generate a broad beam. in this case the logarithmic mode will help."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a curve to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and darker the corresponding pixel image pixels."</seg>
<seg id="436">"on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve showing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste."</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">"if you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve."</seg>
<seg id="439">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the Luminance canal. shade and sun shades were placed with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digious; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to blend the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">"the preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value."</seg>
<seg id="445">"controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels."</seg>
<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially when mixing monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion so that you can reduce your monochrome conversion in which you reduce the brows first."</seg>
<seg id="447">The saving as and loading buttons are used for this purpose. any blender setting can save you later and load it later. the used file format is the gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digious; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but it creates, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm has been removed from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus, as well as most digitized images require a correction of the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images, a camera is often applied in internal sharpness. in contrast, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner addresses a field filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this allows you to access sharpness with the menu entry."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, the sharpness of the edges increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpness of an image will refocus the tool. under refocusing, you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to softer softer softer and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and previewing help to edit the image. preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore you should sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped picture, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempted, thus avoiding beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of blurred masketing filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image is the (2). blurred masketing was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious; tool refocus a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected defission filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. refocus usually reaches better results than blurred masketing. you can start it from the menu by calling colors refocused in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the swelling pixies that are far from the original pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauss folds is actually very strongly influenced by the removed pixels, causing unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will further complicate the image."</seg>
<seg id="502">"if you use a value nonzero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauss's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you have placed will be saved for later, and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leaving unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, impient masking produces better results than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, impenetrating mask must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur. in the Wiener filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in handling small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unfocused picture has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">You can read a technical comparison in English under this address for more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital images.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothes the blur of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the colour tinplate allows a customized colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unparalleled speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to smooth smoothness over the image."</seg>
<seg id="520">"composite dependence Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value suggests a high value wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines relative smoothness. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-increment da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stepping width [0,1, 10]: integral stepping width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel size and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you get by choosing this option is minimal. it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">"the buttons save as and load precisely this. any adjustment of image errors can be corrected hereby in a text file, and then recharged later."</seg>
<seg id="528">"error correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation using the Cancel button at any time."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the module is applied in a photo that is made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artifact that is caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filter to remove stains and other artefacts which occur e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; -Effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow Details and the Advanced Settings window will remain in default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) that is used for filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. if you want to remove a weak rustling or JPEG artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the brightness tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the picture. we recommend either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamma-tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerances of darker areas, which are typically more rustling. however, it also spends the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is responsive to variations of luminance. if it is elevated, noise and phase jitter can appear at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be saved into the filesystem and then loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to softer softer softer and experiment with the smoothing tool. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">Die & digikam; Photo Restauration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to lessen photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's noise, film granting, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that make the content like it also makes the human eye."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for colouring and texture correction. the texture of the texture is developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / Frannkreich, and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are visible in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>
<seg id="549">"the buttons save as and load precisely this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file, and then recharged later."</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo-Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation using the button Finish at any time."</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo with uniform noise is restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film granting on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time texture is reduced to an old colour photo caused by a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts created by scanner lighting and photopaper. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">"it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dickopp."</seg>
<seg id="554">"bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels."</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels & quot; bright pixels & quot; bright pixel & quot; in a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">"if you have an old digital camera, it is important to record the darkpicture directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Defects."</seg>
<seg id="558">"first, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching darkpicture to the image corrected."</seg>

<seg id="560">Select an area to view the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate those pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">"cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim), or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block."</seg>
<seg id="565">"below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="566">"die & digikam; Vignetting Correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image."</seg>
<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not light the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shady) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an opening of f / 16 or less, as otherwise unsharpness effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure areas of today's film and color or greyscale lines of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using an equivalent transformation with a center filter to an image. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three regulators, you can control the vignette correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with a lens setting of 1, or randomly to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma setting: the editing of an image with the vignetting correction decreases the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the brightness of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want a fine re-adjustment of the desired image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the Gradation Menu."</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digitalisation; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>

<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar directional effect, but flattens off the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth degree corrects the remote corners opposite to that of the second degree. if you combine these two combinations any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">"general: this value controls the strength of distortion second density. with negative values, distortion-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth density. this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the image. for most of the lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the reverse sign of the parameter general."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scales the image size and thus leads to the correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image resize.</seg>
<seg id="583">"brighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase them."</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box shows the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used for the next start as standard values."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the tonical or pincushion distortion should be performed before all cutting or size changes. ideally, you perform this correction as the first one. if you want to re-cut a picture and then perform a tonical correction, the effect would be apparent from the wrong."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in order to help you to find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide line. move it to an important place, such as the sea level or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners."</seg>
<seg id="588">"the next logical step for some subjects such as images from the front, frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective."</seg>

<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you inflate or guess the details? how can you see or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here is a good job. try it and you'll see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to tress the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many imaging programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo blowing was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>

<seg id="643">"in the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog stays there."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool According to aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high format or landscape format. in the high format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inch or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapers and their aspect ratio."</seg>

<seg id="651">"golden middle: the golden middle is a division based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc."</seg>
<seg id="654">The center of gold provides liquefied help lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third-sail gel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral, creating a symmetrical visual stream."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles are also derived from the golden spiral debated above. its vertex points are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be released a static object more dynamically."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles."</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal and Vertical Mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the color button, you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle. you can do this by using the & digious; image editing and tool free rotation."</seg>
<seg id="663">"rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed right above."</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. now, adjust it with a pressure to the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after you shot a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is to use the function transform cutting out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is Auto Cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image slightly after the rotation. note however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. preview will then automatically be recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">"new Width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>

<seg id="673">Corner right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Corner left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Corner right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little bit lubricated. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adapted the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes at the corners."</seg>
<seg id="678">"this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a square will be distorted. in other words, a square will be distorted into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transforming scissors."</seg>
<seg id="679">"rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angle is reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed right from the preview area."</seg>

<seg id="681">"after you have done the shear, the picture is wiped a bit. for a single shear, this effect is usually negligible, but two drachings produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after the shear, the image has nice triangular holes in the corners."</seg>
<seg id="683">"the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, compiled from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="684">"because of this dependency on other libraries, it is impossible to add a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if a picture is rendered with only one pixel per pixel, several errors can occur. these images often have a moirè pattern or stage effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these errors. generally pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is adaptive; recursively, because each pixel is split again and again and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre-defined threshold, the pixels are divided into 4 subpixels, which are individually monitored and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to create noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch jittering, change & Povray; the beams with a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">"the last option for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection will be calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable visibility for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music from youths, portable devices and auto-stereos. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset InSane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoder program to create folder and file names, as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of themselves into the computer. it is important to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal but I (referring to the editor: that's the author) bin no attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music business can be mastered."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"in many countries there are copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographical closest to the nearest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online recall of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) just the updates of the database.</seg>

<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"for the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) can be selected on the tab card to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab yourself."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoder. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher encoder.</seg>

<seg id="1540">"check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggic for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>

<seg id="1661">This section shows how to display General MIDI Patches to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also not leave line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to create all tones that this instrument needs to stack on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (e.g. with tone 60), you can wear a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which is similar to a gun type. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here the term" "drum patch" "refers to a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards possess)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"like the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used primarily to map sounds on the percussion channel. look at the keymaps provided for example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map a number of channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply do this in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need 16 or 9 channels)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section thus has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored which attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for pitch benderRatio indicates in which ratio pitch bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch bender event with the value n, this is converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then first forwarded. the value 4096 is used so that in the Map file there are no decimal commas."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM specifies that a keyboard, which receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, will play a tone higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; try walking around."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob does not illuminate any more green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. view the menu Settings under the Point Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the pace-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without additional AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)"</seg>

<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"after NeueXML does not exist, it will be created in the proper folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder."</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most mentioned extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to search for an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"func1, func2, func2, func1, func1, func2, # Sec2.html Section 2 = # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.3 Sec2.1 = Sec2.1.html Section 2 = # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.3 Sec2.1 = Sec2.1.html Section 2 = # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.3 Sec2.1 = Sec2.1.html Section 2 = # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example you can now see in the & PHP documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = Language.basic-syntax.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consistently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything but watch & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is displayed. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection rows."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"a simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;)."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"now, you can easily save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to use the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the lost resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or anyone else."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other and quantaplus users can download them."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be prompted for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource, the input fields have to be filled (URL preview may remain empty) and clicking OK the uploading will be started."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"the uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD packages (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and Script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, still before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML languages currently not by & quantaplus; it is supported to work by creating a DTEP package, but the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in the tag XML format. there is the simplest way to convert a DTD to a DTEP package automatically."</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>

<seg id="2080">"fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility."</seg>
<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand these and to be able to understand the full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;"</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; using, available, from tool bars over actions is all that is marked as global, in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to anyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements are a personal collection of web development remedies for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which means the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorpane, the Building Insights, the Cartridge with information and the toolbar. please hit in, and for further information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click the tab with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all card trailders, recharge, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu concerning the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the tag under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the top of the editing window, the toolbar of the editor is located. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is used as a standard for which a set of toolbars will be displayed. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and the related user requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; in your document, then click the symbol that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog boxes."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the building manners (QIT;) enable it to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and roam. in the presentation with card readers are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation building manners."</seg>

<seg id="2093">"a further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities open to you."</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you can find information about the scripting languages available. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works also here. clicking with the left mouse button lets you access the available information to a script."</seg>

<seg id="2099">"by default, & quantaplus; two boxes at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window."</seg>
<seg id="2100">"this tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the Markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. toolbars are the option to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar by e-mail.</seg>

<seg id="2107">"while trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus started to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus? well, this would make it the most powerful web development tool for & kde; so it was done."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what was changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white signs. later a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it into one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file-browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when compiling:"</seg>

<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check coding, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more annoyance when somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other is different in one row, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the tipparting easier by simply writing the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">"the Microsoft Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than" "Medium" "(default setting)."</seg>
<seg id="2294">"open dialog enables manual typing of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"via the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the match or merge of folders is introduced. if a file is selected for A and C, however, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if collisions are checked, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window."</seg>
<seg id="2299">"you can also drag and drop: drag a file from a file manager, or select text from an editor, and drop it over a comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you'd just need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3. now you can simply copy, paste and compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can do nothing out of diffuse; only the drop-down of text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copy and paste). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the information line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse to rest over the line. then a small relief pane will show the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B colour green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed using the settings menu.)"</seg>

<seg id="2306">"when differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (with C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and commentaries, for preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line separating the summary side from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file does not have lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted with broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the results window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription:, the filename and [Change] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>

<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or string. in the default setting, the list of log messages will be changed automatically, so that only log messages will be displayed next to the filter."</seg>

<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only a specific process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command, such as the samba server startup. in this case, use filtering strip."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the option to new lines in the main window context menu to show all new additions to the log file."</seg>

<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system is rapidly developing to the standard for control of program start-up in the & Linux world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects here (e.g. because I do not know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without a reinstallation and re-formatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things like setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run a rc.serial port in / etc / rc.d."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking init at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably note that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can reboot / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how do you start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? easy: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually run these scripts by hand on command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will start with the start argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel running only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. additionally, I could have a user runlevel, that's & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another line is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or move the position within a level by dragging it elsewhere. this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the field of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously been in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the number number of an entry cannot be calculated at times. in such a case, you need to edit the sorption numbers of the surrounding items before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to enable the different working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move one entry to another runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (using Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the number number or name of an entry manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to change the changes, or press ESc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be saved by & ksysv; changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runes and now the machine is constantly reboating. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the file / etc / inittab, and edit the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be alright)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
