although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , dancing to American music , American authors read and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist for an American movie . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter , who , with the help of Julia Roberts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; I was like it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA was only reinforced . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me how to deal with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party ever reached . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person ?
I was not able to reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps also agreed to view the world view by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns while playing .
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her lifetime , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel has helped me much in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love towards America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump made his way to nom@@ inate republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a hold and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency gave a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t to non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they had either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call the Tr@@ ump voters to be assi@@ sts .
&quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , would they perhaps say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; but you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( meaning &quot; White against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ) , &quot; white in reference to the wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , &quot; as the great Van Jones said , has just killed what America did so splen@@ did@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have , America is welcome everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ ans , whose history , as he says himself , would nowhere else be possible in the world . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , if my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices cried lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music played at both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with the ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ al violence . &quot;
but this changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered youth such a rare hop@@ eless@@ ness .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; always smiling and playing with shiny eyes and play in the tur@@ bo you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing a village that is practically at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments manufactured from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments composed of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers began to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all produced out of the waste . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early times : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra which plays instruments of re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Müll@@ de@@ pon@@ ie ) records the musical performance : &quot;
the world generates about a billion tons of waste every year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played its music even in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental issues . &quot;
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship already had illegal fishing in the Liber@@ ian waters before it looked for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were accordingly brought up accordingly , and little inclined to welcome a criminal law of this species at its coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were swi@@ f@@ tly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused . &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at his time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 launched by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fish@@ eries ) . &quot;
&quot; besides Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that at that time had driven the prime minister out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this , we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand out from each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , why it is extremely difficult to detect . &quot;
&quot; due to the inten@@ tional dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were imp@@ eded by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the snail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , actions happen today in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange existing licenses , updates on suspic@@ ious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move on the open sea via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships that are fishing in forbidden areas , such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were travelling and possibly whether they have a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay punishment as in the Fall of the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , head director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the so @-@ called platform was created to reg@@ ain an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH network every year due to illegal fishing that penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include actions like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , quot@@ ing of ph@@ anta@@ sies , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international co @-@ operation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ brid@@ led control system , &quot; says Long . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies suspected of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
it discovered crime networks that had distributed counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has persec@@ uted and found escap@@ ing ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evol@@ ving , also helps to track down the illegal ships they like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishing companies use sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so that they can no longer be ordered by satell@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally operating ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently Sky@@ Truth has launched the platform global Fishing Watch together with Google and the ocean protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data , and by means of which the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; join the neigh@@ bors to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bund@@ le their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project , in which a global system allows tracking of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also dis@@ courage them . &quot;
ships that previously f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences now know they are being watched .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH countries now have a 33 % increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to trace the Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board of to@@ wing nets . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are an object of study . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear every year due to illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries have joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they too fight against illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state of Somalia could announce its first major triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag . and not only was the ship operated without a license and were used to@@ wing nets , which are meanwhile prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seems to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s official release .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country fell into empt@@ iness by joining the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the re @-@ recovery of Venezuela ) , both images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among other things , in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north @-@ located Bun@@ de@@ staat ( Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o ) and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country wor@@ sens continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition in the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro had the chance of a fundamental change , but in the end the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government committee as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) , and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the election campaign , Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups were united in the elections of 2015 , was to continue to oppose the election of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among others an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that talk about confron@@ tations as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment are accum@@ ulating . &quot;
particularly large waves struck the message about police repression in the central @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Guard did not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic prepar@@ es the round , which forms the amount of supp@@ ression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a presidential proceedings - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado say that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your inaugur@@ ation !
on the road !
&quot; others consider this protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and is rather busy letting critical voices be silent : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adap@@ tive version of an interview conducted by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fied at the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought it was ok . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ tur@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret services division 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
clos@@ eup .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who was before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
&quot; you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; pass only that they don &apos;t kid@@ nap you one day , and I have to save you . &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
&quot; for this reason , he banned me to go to the gym . a few days later he took me to work on military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret agent . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners &apos; tor@@ tured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack where cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - were simply everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blank@@ et and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I approached and saw a couch that people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they mounted the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body which was lying there .
&quot; they rarely bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw him with water and hun@@ ted him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eye bonds . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian , who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked human beings were lying with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
&quot; near the entrance , people che@@ wed quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you get me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me home about it .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero made a man there and killed a man there .
&quot; ( according to the testimony of survivors , the civilian is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way where the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you will see that they took about this route and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ hum@@ ani@@ zation .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be laid . &quot;
this was a lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; A@@ war@@ ds@@ men &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
&quot; at that time at age , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was at the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ onet or perhaps military emblem that one has fought against an enemy that is fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is no war @-@ spo@@ iler but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I &apos;d never really like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , &quot; &quot; And you , who steal cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded rage , struck me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover swe@@ ater of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still made clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence , a con@@ jur@@ er accused me of being in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . but why do the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why children kid@@ nap ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl back home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; again and again I asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they would have simply been able to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why do their bodies disappear ? &quot;
were these people not also families who could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that man can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they picked up machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were grin@@ ded and taken away somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something always remains .
I have seen how you killed people !
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie myself .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian sentim@@ ents &quot; that they suppos@@ edly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I made the first advertisement . &quot;
finally I realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can repro@@ ach me that I am bi@@ ased . I finally put out against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , torture in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 years of age . &quot;

&quot; jud@@ gements in the &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 Supp@@ res@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court imposed li@@ fel@@ ong sentences in 28 cases and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ Staats@@ ster@@ ror@@ ism &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pi@@ ero de Mon@@ ti was kid@@ n@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , who was the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who advoc@@ ated or disappeared the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located so that a memorial site could be built there , which is now being led by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where one can extend his driving licence . &quot;
the photo was distributed in social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence , in the last month , witnessed a very special mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous translation . &quot;
&quot; in a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; sar@@ cop@@ epo@@ chs &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ bel@@ sha ) , &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; means wron@@ g@@ ly - but perhaps also with malicious back@@ war@@ dness &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September in electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos which has been widely shared in social media .
&quot; the fault was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n magazine published in Kyoto wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city such as Kyoto , simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; drivers drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally incorrect designation &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) were replaced . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture exc@@ used for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ologies :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News became more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the share of older mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents across the country , however , is quite a reason for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , equivalent to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1.@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has declined overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period . &quot;
the named repor@@ ter published in the published version of the article published comments to the light who apparently pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparently against older mot@@ orists :
&quot; among other things , the Yahoo article about the translation errors has received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful driving &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How faul@@ ty is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .
photo of Fli@@ ckr user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally the conviction is that trans@@ lators should not be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers .
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ any staff with English as their native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , expenses or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still make translations in the company @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English language skills are considered the best , is the translator - no matter how good or bad their language skills are really . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with mer@@ ry results .
&quot; the confused and mysterious sentences , which arise by automated translation , show that this technique cannot replace any human trans@@ lators for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ckr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but by large companies or by the government , who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more accurate translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto uses a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the &quot; Nav@@ eed con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; portal ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also survived recordings of protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups who oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred its parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are locked again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially during periods of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot;
it &apos;s amazing that this is still more favorable than buying two liters of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ S@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server answer questions of certain domains correctly . &quot;
&quot; if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server will reply faul@@ ty or ref@@ uses to request such a website . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third blocked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , 6th April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on show again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections , making the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia reporting on the current events in the country . &quot;

Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ ans who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shor@@ tened version of a brief report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kindly permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying Co@@ ws , falling schools &quot; ) which are edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proud@@ ly spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; she who has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers its age @-@ old son or her under@@ age daughter to another , weal@@ thier family . in exchange , the child receives food , an apprentic@@ eship and a roof above the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must pay for a number of days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a treaty that cannot be raised . &quot;
&quot; this practice , known as Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to its involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she talked with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is being vacc@@ inated for the Cri@@ adi@@ ana guarantees in general silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ mean Az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they can complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something of themselves &quot; &quot; are handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who takes up the girl with her and justi@@ fies its exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ mean Az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will know about it for many years . &quot;
sometimes they even never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer , Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants situated 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra defeated a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered le@@ thal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UNI@@ CE@@ F or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela bl@@ amed the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ mean Az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations requested a prompt investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be ground@@ breaking - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ ans are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to go all work and began selling cand@@ y on the street , or on the market , to earn money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
she had to share the time so that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; Fri@@ days for example clean the fridge , cleaned up the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner it was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the master &apos;s library as food from the refrigerator , &quot; she re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power between 1954 and 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not enter@@ tain her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family , because they thought that I would study &quot; bad habits . &quot; &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had enabled them to lose , explains them . &quot;
&quot; however , you were completely clear that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; even in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken is bul@@ lying and the chic@@ anes they face when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to come home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I feel particularly clear that I belong to no group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;

bill dict@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; regul@@ ating the use and usage of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when it is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law a place would then be established , which was commissioned to use citizens to grant permission to grant social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it failed to do so , it could bring about a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six par@@ agra@@ phs and circul@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs on the Internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice , video messages and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is assumed , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration process . it is un@@ clear that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ adh Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and Pro@@ mot@@ er of the Legis@@ lative Council , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and a password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to this , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research scientist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that the same way they can control violent physical public and private spaces can also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with parliament and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; Ra@@ o@@ of says . &quot;
&quot; last year , MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ cho@@ y suggested a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life imprisonment for those destined to thre@@ aten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold has been published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the northeast of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which stri@@ ves through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; how Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or exists . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore states that they have a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an area .

&quot; a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the catastrophe . &quot;
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a state pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let whole coastal cities disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture had an atomic accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building and the survey results of those affected themselves .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare homes ( forem@@ an proletariat survived , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was reported by Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , even six years after the catastrophe , it is still possible to reloc@@ ate to final replacement homes , even six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated from Beh@@ el shel@@ ters ( Cau@@ cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) . &quot;
&quot; after the thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are back in operation , only 30 percent of fishing har@@ bours have res@@ um@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident occurred extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of land destroyed by 5 400 hectares of land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear block zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma stays down well . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers think it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to obtain an overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken steps to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed found that still not enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has been done . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has increasingly focused its attention on the position of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the tremendous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement homes . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated people who are still in homes are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma compete with massive building projects . &quot;
&quot; the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater initially than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often sees that a more connects than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a migration has consolidated its aff@@ ection to the Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as rec@@ alls the lack of shared language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit . last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia attacked him with a strike against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him on this Saturday and now moved him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which rapidly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his hit on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care station , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several san@@ it@@ aries shortly thereafter . &quot;
another video with the same scenes but fil@@ med from a different perspective is also di@@ pped in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while being in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which last Friday was brutal police raid against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , police officers put on a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , a social and peace party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud@@ speakers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have distor@@ ted street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window disc . &quot;
Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo discussed a broken glass window aimed at illustr@@ ating their front pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken glass window than about the protests of thousands of people who serve to defend a special cause .
you must also recognise this if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ indu@@ str@@ alization For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso &apos;s law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the Western Cub@@ an province of May@@ di@@ que , is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ with@@ standing that there is no significant sugar cane in the village . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
&quot; after harv@@ esting , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some were changing the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are back into operation because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harvest has not yet been a new one . &quot;
why has the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry been turned off ?
the old platform of the community already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and they were barely competitive for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about $ 85 million for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the breast@@ feeding of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich &apos;s sugar cane factory on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repe@@ ats most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially auth@@ ored documents , which were only distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters were more and more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction it helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ top producer was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to work places and services generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president was looking into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is only extracted by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to protest , they stopped to asp@@ ire the street , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other establishments . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were replaced by spare parts .
&quot; without future perspectives , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve the care of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring to the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a re@@ trac@@ table person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot;
they torture him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes in pension at age 65 , not because it l@@ acks strength , but because it is em@@ bit@@ tered . &quot;

first Nations youth use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy N@@ arrows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; youth of the First Nations communities in the whole of Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do it with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leader mobil@@ es mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the teacher David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop thus rises to the young participants in conversations with themes such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the sphere of the Kit@@ Sum@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section in West Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases have mostly not been elu@@ ci@@ dated .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey , how important is the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of global@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ sk@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in circulation , as well as a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day that you will hear our cry .
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go ahead as well as our youth .
so they can do what they have ordained the Creator .

&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

in Japan one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is located exactly on the menu , close to the entrance to sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( proposed projection of the &quot; &quot; sculp@@ tural models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) is issued by any food that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of small businesses that produce those sculp@@ tural dishes , which the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos show this unusual twist with sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ cri@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile ri@@ bb@@ ons decorated with plastic sheets as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in essenti@@ als is becoming increasingly more complicated .
in this case the emperor @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple which keeps your mobile phone holding :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comedy .
&quot; some mobile stand and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , I@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile with salmon . &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes may also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example , to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our newest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand @-@ made ri@@ bb@@ ons made of dried salmon . &quot;
you can view more sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # mush@@ porn by using the help of the h@@ ash@@ tag # seemingly screensavers .
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the bl@@ ends and killed regularly occur in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle carries with them . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Net@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ing a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , telling stories of people involved in the fight between criminal prosecution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal pol@@ í@@ tico is describing the project like this :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is seeking secret gra@@ ves for every weekend according to his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who in only one day lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and look for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
&quot; Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a . &quot;
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay her out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get those ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts that show frag@@ ility and state leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a researcher of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I &apos;ve been familiar with illness and sensation journ@@ alism for a couple of years now .
&quot; I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with images , which can only come from a text@@ book for criminals or from specialists from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it seems like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become a member of Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) if he is big . and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone , and those who fear that something happens to them . &quot;
&quot; I see our weakness , when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ tim@@ eless@@ ness of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbouring place are justified with the fact that they were &quot; based . &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family with threats was lo@@ oted . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of this never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back up when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the far@@ ther we are apart , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I wonder@@ ed in these terrible days if we@@ eping would solve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cry . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez &quot; &quot; : a generation managed by violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who car@@ es for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , so@@ wn potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had been over two years before , when he was just a few blocks from his home , who saw bloody bodies of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
when Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed with the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Civil Security and Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosecution had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 counts per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ing a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ckr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he links , contain images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to capture trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the town S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country was neglected for years and devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; authorities &apos; representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses envel@@ op@@ ed , including a cinema nearby , which was full of people watching the football world champi@@ onships . &quot;
houses are plast@@ ered and char@@ red bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ated bodies that are str@@ ung out on the ground while persons watching them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed real but not associated trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o Go@@ won . &quot;
witnesses reported dramatic of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only using satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated metap@@ hor@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ clear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again as proof of the fact and extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented assignment to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
&quot; one more step further , personal comments like this example wron@@ g@@ ly fal@@ sely relate the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning message released by the United Nations , those who could flee could strike blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following reported these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page , which in 2012 claimed that the president of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an Being said , monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to see this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , which called AF@@ P as their source , wron@@ g@@ ly attributed th@@ ein to this statement , but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false information
traces of these false cou@@ plings reach back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; with the help of a &quot; reverse search , &quot; you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ on of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have for@@ warded false reports and others have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es .
&quot; we have limited examples of abuse and associated with the respective countries , on the basis of which they have been published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which are also linked together in some cases ) several examples can be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases that can now be flus@@ h@@ ed completely ( on the card in orange ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of false cou@@ pl@@ uses in the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to demonstrate counter@@ fei@@ ting examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that pursu@@ es sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being persec@@ uted , since the photos were used ab@@ usi@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government released a ple@@ th@@ ora of what it came to be &quot; inten@@ tionally ingeni@@ ous news and photos , international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this recti@@ fication , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to counter@@ f@@ eit pictures of rum@@ ors that operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims are Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar has admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still contained in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic nearby An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later turned into circulation in connection with Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ ya@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sle@@ eps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo de@@ vised , provided with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events , presum@@ ably in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; Germany , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,000 times ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Indonesian ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message suppos@@ edly made by a &quot; &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be incorrect . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image was contained in DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ in@@ arian Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , ag@@ greg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , however , are not completely tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally have image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all those cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing and depri@@ ve them of the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study which investigated how violent media inter@@ acts to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used in the context or in a completely ab@@ usi@@ ve way . &quot;
&quot; however , each investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog un@@ v@@ eils the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

&quot; a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
&quot; such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these un@@ riv@@ alled words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all ob@@ stin@@ ately ob@@ stin@@ ately oppose any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression suff@@ ices not , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT @-@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Fati@@ gue for your parents in recognition of your efforts in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med in the sun during cold days . &quot;
in Birds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they sli@@ ce other cultures , reve@@ aling different thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page and show how different , valuable and impressive are these small languages . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka changes with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the Sri Lanka island state is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ fall disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which is normally used in the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have come across the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the disaster space of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ c@@ ely hundreds of people are missing because of the flo@@ ods and mud@@ guards . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ inf@@ alls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 m . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates for flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flo@@ ods are wor@@ sen@@ ing the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; today morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus in the flo@@ ods , water level up to 6 m . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are completed to transport emergency supplies for the residents enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
fac@@ ebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ nec@@ essi@@ ties for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ ero Center will be informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for retri@@ eving help and donations . &quot;
they also conducted a &apos; SOS &apos; button which resulted in more than thousands of en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slide .
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;
the Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girl .
&quot; I trust her my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next we channel rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the icon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other gu@@ inea slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which developed themselves in their imagination . &quot;
they ab@@ ro@@ de me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims like me do not fit into it , Muslims are being exp@@ elled . &quot;
to be Muslim
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a major part of the world &apos;s 1,7 billion Muslims .
&quot; another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries . &quot;
this entic@@ ing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid destroyed the story behind these images . &quot;
but these images continue to rise even today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood remain ste@@ ad@@ fast . &quot;
&quot; I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I saw how these powerful , faul@@ ty narr@@ atives domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed reality , which in the last three decades led nine Muslim women to their countries , while the USA did not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head cloth in public buildings and Saudi Arabia , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements to change .
it looks beyond the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it delet@@ es the existence of que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this narrative has seized our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of an@@ tim@@ icro@@ bi@@ al attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion but it is fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
usage approved .
&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother placed her first costume design at 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ir@@ radi@@ ated Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now ir@@ radi@@ ated Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ ker@@ chiefs , which all Muslims carry with them - &quot; &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I j@@ est , we do not wear all ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts in order to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional safety checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to combat widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current volume by a well @-@ trained Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which already has an er@@ ron@@ eous idea of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who sn@@ aps the veil . &quot;
&quot; or as the frigh@@ tening card of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below . &quot;
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam hos@@ tility in its ug@@ liest forms reaches our belonging .
&quot; it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered that it is impossible to fit into a drawer . &quot;
the author 1986 on a photo of her kinder@@ garten group .
usage approved .
I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but to be a Muslim was born into my imagination only when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they use the following mean@@ ings : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girl@@ friend , my neighbor , see my rock in the surf , that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our homes . &quot;
she would see the all @-@ evening ritual with my daughter when I see her in my arms and whis@@ pers the Arab verses to protect the Koran and call the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters some@@ time in the 1960s . &quot;
usage approved .
belonging to me is the image of my grand@@ mother with her mother &apos;s side with her sisters ; how many decades ago they won a competition for the art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its perf@@ ected and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ Holy ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me to speak , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over centuries - has been colon@@ ised by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which has founded a company with the name Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ des @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God the only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
usage approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about the modern Islam and the In@@ dependence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim , it means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; &quot; all except four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was thrown out over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ ish sub@@ jection of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he was the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before planes existed , he travelled into more parts of the world than I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion go deep into our unforgettable family @-@ trees ; our un@@ established story .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops distributed across each continent aside from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to hunt weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is lie buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy enters the US and the susp@@ ects bear a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave called Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion carries more possibilities than a cub@@ it cube , but is represented in the reducing branches &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this duality . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regi@@ str@@ ates , which began with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the Immig@@ ration Officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it exists in a country which borders its boundaries towards people from just the countries it bombar@@ ds .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; that largely occup@@ ies Arabs and Muslims .
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw to Muslim lands .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists at the North@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 concerning evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the least score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; we are too deeply involved to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous bil@@ e prints we ste@@ ad@@ fast@@ ly in our news collections . &quot;
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten hist@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video gallery Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this gives me hope . &quot;
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global tim@@ eline in which we are .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years before , it had not yet existed ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but today that made me an un@@ bound Muslim . &quot;
things that I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ ts that make up our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ vers@@ ations take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or whom we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why would I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where however Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be brought and people through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public perception , was a scientist of Stan@@ ford four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we have to face ourselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously perpet@@ u@@ ating the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girl@@ friend and I were bombar@@ ded during the Women &apos;s March , as he already bombar@@ ded countries and &quot; other &quot; made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
the initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban voice diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ckr user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language story@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in her original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ riv@@ alled blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite such small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project apply :
the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure rooms in which residents do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; while listening is often connected with it , &quot; &quot; try these events instead &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , to make . &quot;
&quot; in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their dedication and representation lead to the audience &apos;s audience . &quot;
they cause laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art typical for their country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the b@@ abel from the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the importance of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feelings of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
you were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and organizers hope to expand this . all those inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling tours . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for US re@@ establishment of state debt
&quot; the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which rose to 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ental Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da . &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate remun@@ eration , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be rewarded with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not integrated into the United States Government - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , the measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration wore the name &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the German CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house published by the so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; books within three to five days , read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ qu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : collective Cl@@ ose Research ) . &quot;
the book published last year and is freely available here is a series of papers dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
this book would like to discuss how movements for Free knowledge are built and what the real costs are to which this is connected .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side on page to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we haven &apos;t had any information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Colle@@ ctive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process from time @-@ time extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for Open Source and Digital Activ@@ ist has been in custody by Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a command of the military tri@@ bunal taken from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and notified them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el plays a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently crossing the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes were predicted to be the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross @-@ crossing of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural legacy of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this expe@@ dient to digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el has not yet been able to complete this project . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life with freedom to dream and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in custody . &quot;
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ s@@ ular cloth she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
she sm@@ iled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English .
the book is roy@@ alty @-@ free .
cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is devoted to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that each of the dangers does not matter to me , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I play in every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I bear with passion , &quot;
when your eyes bid f@@ arewell
and I let another piece of my soul be with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ sels &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime in 2011 , more than 60,000 people have disappeared under Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violent repression by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many more people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .

&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger at a corruption case , where a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants for the em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tics ( about 800@@ ,000 Euros ) . &quot;
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique whose advice Cam@@ ba@@ za was between 2005 and 2008 .
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his res@@ etting to the company , which happened on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the Att@@ orney General of the Republic , which rejected the motion , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to res@@ ume his old post as the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many people do not welcome the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica ( C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ address the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate disciplinary proceedings against the conf@@ lic@@ ting .
&quot; the company , however , apparently and did not initiate appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had taken off . &quot;
&quot; he could keep paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za likes to be paid for silence . &quot;
re@@ fut@@ able !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no moral : &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state .
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za l@@ acks the mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served by the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as hand@@ ing it became an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself was we@@ ary of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;

&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he confirmed the fact that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wron@@ g@@ ly
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ lice . &quot;
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ por@@ ted &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or manuscript wid@@ ths schemes ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely decre@@ asing con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically generate hate speech . &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts where they discussed the use of the word were cens@@ ored .
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; but he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
&quot; in the opinion that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , Z@@ in win also emphas@@ ised that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before all posts loos@@ ened suspected of spreading rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ e@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the words next . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to trim their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; banned from the social network :
&quot; when I became aware of this new Facebook rule , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to copy , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards did not meet . &quot;
Facebook has removed a number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are poor . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fake braces . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million us@@ ef@@ ulness , which would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate language but still have been removed : &quot;
with permission used .
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot;
&quot; just to try out whether Facebook removes the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; scre@@ enshot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
&quot; scre@@ enshot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech is meant to hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to bring out the prolifer@@ ous hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
Trinidad and Tobago
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament voted unanim@@ ously in favour of a law that should prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the marriage @-@ proof age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , since the age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN Child Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; each person under the age of 18 &quot; is defined . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical Central Office of the Land confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , trying to create laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du @-@ leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should pay attention to their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition meant tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country has to agree and let the law be announced .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not one on the other .
&quot; once it has been decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws of the children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
Baker &amp; Mc@@ K@@ enz@@ ie Firm of the Year for Banking and Finance
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk which has veiled the kernel of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and that is worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it had definitely lasted long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ ir@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came : &quot;

&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , belonging to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the marriage @-@ proof age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the design for the change of the couple was decided today on June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the voting .
all dep@@ u@@ ties who were against have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ birth sign .
many thanks to all the activists who made him fo@@ stered .
hear@@ ty congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s best @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj proclaimed his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to release his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the Att@@ orney General of Paris Al Ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj was going against the law , most social media users wanted to approach the issue differently . &quot;
Patricia High@@ rell suggested :
&quot; rather , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that we would like to invite the state into our bedrooms , if we , instead of talking about the problem that it may be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ bo@@ iled men , who are facing them in the benefit of being mis@@ used , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm , although there are laws they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

at 11.15 the message was removed from the page - however it remained in the cache .

&quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosec@@ utor announced the local news service Yar@@ News that they were h@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; by mir@@ r@@ oring websites , Turkish users can see Wikipedia contents again &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia site was presented on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark@@ ened . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month , Turkey now blocks the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day by day becomes clear@@ er how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information as well as reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
&quot; although many techniques @-@ vers@@ ed Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked web pages ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the best @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to remain locked , there are now several mirror sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform lay down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. host machine connections ) , which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
the content is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after listening to the news ( about the block of Wikipedia ) , we put it all about putting snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility of reading the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mir@@ ror@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites , if blocked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Mozilla at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see is by Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia ourselves when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was lying and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he rose from face to face from face to face . &quot;
a tiger cannot interfere with the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ eh@@ ill appeared . he sat down immediately , we look at and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist accommodations .
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , it avo@@ ids women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should ignore the norm to keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was con@@ vic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseu@@ do @-@ court and exp@@ elled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married family . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is also widespread among men . however , they have far fewer inf@@ lic@@ tions to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , presented a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is run by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s orph@@ an@@ ages to exile from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected persons and manages this club .
she reports about how this club created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video showing Roh@@ ini in their discussion rounds consisted of women who do not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they all be du@@ tiful and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not observe this will be regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband at the name , wanted to try at home as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , up@@ set , sad , loving , and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does this mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition where married women never allowed to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that she only c@@ ashed in front of herself during the whole practice ; another decided to release the whole frustr@@ ations against him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands in their name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation dealt with violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , showing the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women only show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ Red point if he did . &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped to wear it .
&quot; the other women did not quit altogether , but they think they are now in a better position to choose to wear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip to every discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear something , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are tied to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they are . &quot;
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have only wore sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ty @-@ kur@@ ta , a wide shirt about a pants , they did not dare . &quot;
&quot; after much contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of its own dress code , mor@@ als connected to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini added their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) to a discussion round , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will make it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly come into roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women rehear@@ sed it a few times , but then again they stopped saying the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including myself , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and are not members of the family . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now bear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the panel know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like h@@ ag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it &apos;s not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tell other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
scre@@ enshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a turning point in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese spin through . &quot;
people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; dear readers , as these audi@@ ob@@ ooks are in German , it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese Kara@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools . &quot;
the Kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places connected with the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , this is your 5 places that you absolutely must visit ! &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
the same we did last year .
&quot; and of course some companies use the fan base also commer@@ cially , such as this R@@ amen shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! adjust@@ Today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day . &quot;
and what could this be for a day ?
I will listen to &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
this is how the day is going to take place today .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;
&quot; following the h@@ ash@@ tag , the Romans were aiming at the Romans to find out more about the Beat@@ les memorial day . &quot;
tens of thousands of men are being depor@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that men of people in Mozambique could be the target of attacks .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; a new system of ab@@ duction of persons for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , wor@@ ts the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ let , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently she conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
&quot; according to the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a man of a beli@@ ever could bring gold or wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC announced . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sk@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN 2016 in the South African country a mission to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ ju@@ dice . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are planning to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to bald men traveling to Mozambique are target ritual attacks , the Mos@@ ambi@@ an police cau@@ tioned according to the latest decree of three bald @-@ headed men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ let , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald @-@ headed men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of persistent individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presum@@ ably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , according to which the victims in the head might have power , generating wealth . &quot;
in the last days three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha told on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN MO@@ DEL BI@@ K , TH@@ AT THE S@@ ME har@@ ms A country where the teachers would be ashamed to take sex against good grades , a nation in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or sli@@ ghty @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; would be hun@@ ted , aimed at reaching rapid wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mak@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our could not be missed . &quot;
&quot; he twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , and the police spokes@@ person Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ are @-@ headed : &quot;

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which was probably just recently taken .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , in the international community , attracted attention after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was admitted to hospital because of liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( state threat ) , having participated in the design of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demands democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us as an &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and a spokes@@ man tells him that he was not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to release calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release him or to give him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised several foreign reactions .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway in Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into a b@@ ump after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately was nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon @-@ exports to China , since exports since 2010 were largely blocked . &quot;
&quot; having spread the message that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at in the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she shared in an explanation on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that the Americans &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as it assi@@ sts him in his recovery .
&quot; a spokes@@ person for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth @-@ Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June to release the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US Embassy broke out a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the foreign ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to press the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
Germany ( EN )
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin , hope that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was released on July 7th and 8th at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns whether the host could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide Li@@ u an appropriate medical care and to give him the opportunity to worry about his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u attorney told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact anyone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um goes on :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights per@@ taining to the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France : France
French Foreign Office requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he needs , regardless of where , needs . furthermore his wife and family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the message sender France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately accept it . &quot;
Taiwan : Taiwan
&quot; on 27 June , the Council of Foreign Affairs in Taiwan asked China to release Li@@ u and to show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means in order to demand political reform and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to permit the ill @-@ based intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama ( Lama )
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been strictly punished , led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association meeting , the minister pointed out that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; this is , most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one can say that we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons led by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , both cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ it@@ arian rulers appear to be democr@@ ats for@@ giving , leaving the distor@@ ted logic , since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; the final week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really no answers . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinions as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point , provided he was paid highly to be part of the Government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points to the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ even important even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ing ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the Singapore political leaders , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ closes the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; ben@@ ign a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a che@@ ating spokes@@ man ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is both land and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they not defend their city ? &quot;
who must pay back our Prime Minister In@@ voices ?
what is the value of our pink human identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I have not said what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defence of the country in particular &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should speak more about the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or homeland ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , reve@@ aling rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world and to show another fac@@ et . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question which is most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that makes us different from American people . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
we clearly say very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you would like to change me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be idle - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but we@@ ar@@ ingly in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders out of &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to pay attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what outside standing as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just chil@@ ly courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada pretty sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ ody Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop @-@ band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that odi@@ zes the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 took the power and in spite of her promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girl@@ friend makes .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 lights . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it acts with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta regime . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the video , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has been pursuing in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Army absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; adjustment change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered as critics of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose there was also set up a new unity in the army , which monitors online content and prosec@@ utes individuals who are accused of having killed the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand uses a strict law against &quot; Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Trip ) .
on 20 May 2014 the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup in the army . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems which the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly created &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut &quot; The Hunger Games of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life continues in ruins of gh@@ ost cities in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society re@@ stores itself very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ ki@@ ava are in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians had lived and worked together in the country . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people after barely a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ zh@@ ch@@ u@@ kov@@ ka , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are lap@@ sed and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot;
it is nevertheless unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens serving all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ow@@ kas , which house one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother for@@ ba@@ de us that we can take pictures , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she just forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she left the destroyed building and disappeared .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal consumption ) such as livestock farming , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to come across the rounds .
&quot; in the winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina is not afraid of leaving Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will forever remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you do not have a vegetable garden or a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she adds . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit . &quot;
but we cannot do it all the time - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s talk partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village fle@@ eing before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 for each child .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot;
she tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right to them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation tends to end , a little boy runs over to us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they are running , some of them throw stones onto the dec@@ ayed building . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure in@@ authenticity in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez introduces a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on 19 April 2017 and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ th @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
she is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there .
this nickname is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about $ 2.50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haiti immigrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some also slept on board . &quot;
it does not want to reject anybody .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medications that they cannot afford , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chic@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with her sister , hoping to get to Boston where she finds her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy weak@@ ened , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez notes that their guests are often sending text messages when they are gone to greet them , or to report on their journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is well known here , but it is not the only spar@@ king hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have picked up migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his home for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blank@@ ets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled with his wife and his three children in Honduras without having to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single one , has offered him a roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next steps . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , the travelers see quietly their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone . &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother she bl@@ ends in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair care , who made her a Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly as she briefly introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have gone already . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang from Twitter @-@ Users cop@@ yable Termin@@ ologies
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi have received a cell phone notification in which they in@@ struct the district government to install a surveillance App called J@@ ing@@ wang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app will prevent you from accessing terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had already installed messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would determine and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books , and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ wang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web sites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans , and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filtering for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many different ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , displaced ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as routine internet shut@@ down@@ s . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter based media outlet &quot; Images from In China , &quot; cens@@ ored news published in China showed photos of a check@@ point in which police officers checked the residents indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ wang App .
mobile al@@ erts promp@@ ted people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you arrive at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; China , &quot; also issued a J@@ ing@@ wang @-@ product description , from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thereby receives unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ wang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ wang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office while operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities released on 27 June in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . however , this promotion viol@@ ates the personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and grants them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , Part 1 : everything is crying out after death &quot;

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one who makes all honor to her name .
one that has crushed into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality rec@@ urs you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood , and all cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts melt in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the Earth is on the axis of the Light . you realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson &quot; as the chief of the Security Service had formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
&quot; during a peaceful protest , five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
&quot; it was sufficient to allow the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accomp@@ li@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning . &quot;
I broke the silence by crying several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my home roof .
I listened to my voice through silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt cour@@ a@@ geous enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a gorgeous picture that filled my expectations completely and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &apos; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were directed toward me .
&quot; and you trust in my eyes , and not on the ground . &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure , as I replied , &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret any word about what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father is the same with that . &quot;
&quot; his father is the same with that . &quot;
the con@@ stri@@ ction of this accur@@ sed sentence is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot;
I pierc@@ ed the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with me .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the individual cells . &quot;
I pre@@ st@@ ole all the details exactly before I cared for the room .
&quot; otherwise , they probably have allocated a larger cell this time . &quot;
I have to share them with only one more prisoner and can immediately set me up without waiting for their permission .
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I attacked a tried and tested communication method : to fight against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my tro@@ phy was a &quot; self @-@ sacrifice . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was an emin@@ ent middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no prominent facial features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all the answers denied its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I remain . &quot;
( no Selection )
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled on the fruit in my head &apos;s garden . &quot;
&quot; from af@@ ar , I still hear them cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es are open , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usions to 13 . ) of the Koran . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; in order to protect the betra@@ yer and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that escap@@ es him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start doing so much more important with your life than to join this day @-@ day and to protest demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it not to reply .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and blows have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; one voice in me said that I had to get used to it or to get used to it , even though I didn &apos;t have done anything to earn that sentence . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear myself as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this loving &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cri@@ es .
&quot; give him pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold your cri@@ es back . &quot;
&quot; my cri@@ es were not yet enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I wonder@@ ed if the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage collector sooner or if it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present us , from their point of view , a great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour three of them alternate , while I was still in the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the hang@@ man re@@ marked the cooling and didn &apos;t find any fav@@ ors about it , which is why it turned next to an electri@@ cally charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flo@@ wed all my body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood . &quot;
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to put myself to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed away that happened to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , as@@ sh@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about dre@@ ad@@ ful things . &quot;
&quot; be still , and get away , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside .
but what you can leave is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel was forced to flee their occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as rocky ( example : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her well @-@ tried opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking , and can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he has a particular dis@@ like against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he refers to himself even when he was born in Jordan , and so far never was in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he po@@ urs in water Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the lu@@ ke@@ g lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the s@@ quad@@ ron of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially if you have a look at the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one avo@@ ids having to do basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan , drinking water , in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual slave woman Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert announcement was . &quot;
&quot; the MEP and former spokes@@ man of the Islamic coalition , Dim@@ a Tah@@ b@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; was canc@@ eled because of sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which is ques@@ tioning the old @-@ proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la over@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement might not be simply a simple rhet@@ oric , but in fact an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved to Lei@@ be &apos;s traditional gender standards by educated his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently d@@ ull unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ our kill@@ ings &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside left . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; according to a crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; be kept in jail for in@@ definite time &quot; , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well known to not shy away from topics that were long as t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , and cannot separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I was in@@ timi@@ dated by politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats quite often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on gender equality have been strongly cens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later point out that his comments were torn from context , distor@@ ted and cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but was only a mach@@ ined version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly campaig@@ ned for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ clear , a poet of the eighth century , who remains in memory still today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ eva was to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs later , in the eighth century openly about homosexu@@ ality could write , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , says H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service took several former members of government and members of the teacher association , stating that they would have cri@@ tically expressed themselves cri@@ tically to the problems associated with the corruption that were deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied Mr. M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is certain that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature on real and basic openness - and not by bombs , stre@@ um@@ ps and artificial ways . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and therefore also offer resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big and extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory states that the stron@@ gh@@ olds inv@@ aded from the west of Japan to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed wag@@ ons are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high fortress was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sc@@ iss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; rarely , out@@ ward appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like those of the Fris@@ e@@ urs . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street gangs and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric look@@ out , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy school , located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to exchange young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s art which enables them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud of , because out of love with the children we have built this educational community . &quot;

the following article is the edited version of the &quot; declaration of love to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel exp@@ elled to accommodate aff@@ ection ? &quot;
this is exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Recon@@ ciliation ) that encourages young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was considered as significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak about a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years and who were exposed to war rhet@@ oric around the clock , must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , who had become accu@@ stom@@ ed to living in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take into its ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian had to join and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter - which should then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letter to reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk soon with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more needed . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent encour@@ agement . &quot;
&quot; the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a story of war a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; I never thought I would forgive me &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19th .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municipal Administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally convey the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they did before in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive any orders , but letters of people from all over the country . &quot;
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings can be tra@@ vers@@ ed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a representative of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him lying on the bed a M@@ GL gar@@ net was lying , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; I answered him anyway and said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answered it . &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry about the war , it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected something else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from hunger . &quot; &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there that is waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices :
&quot; at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were joined to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in hiding .
&quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the entire Colom@@ bian people worked out . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear those people who have never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I &apos;ve often seen as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and done so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and embrace . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ stav@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Mor@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
&quot; according to the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , it was proph@@ esi@@ ed that after dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would rule . &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there are ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to take up arms , rise and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call upon all the def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova and whose first publication on the website OC media took place .
&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with hor@@ rors , activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ash over the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community has not yet emerged over night .
&quot; OC media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what happened in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports published which addressed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspic@@ ious que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after having experienced Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , hunting was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , she moved to the USA last end . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organization .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he &apos;d be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents got the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just getting a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you Sch@@ and@@ sta@@ ck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up again at the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started sh@@ outing .
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ch wounds in my right lung .
OC media : in which cases were you laid - in which men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out @-@ of @-@ date , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful to him for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that this was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have cup size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a sn@@ ck around her neck .
luckily the neigh@@ bors came and saved them .
&quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with dark@@ ened windows and a license plate with a 95 . &quot;
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights friends reviewed the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering me , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in safety just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know already in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about gender equ@@ ation , this is a tab@@ oos issue . &quot;
I still wear some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I desire , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to see how the person looks at which she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do to those who have stayed behind ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that no people were arrested and tor@@ tured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not exclude a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; in this way , I mean , they probably download their relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped from their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this just a guess or have you got a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard was grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; until now , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to s@@ have themselves ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , before 2003 , I was already well known in the whole of Gros@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
seriously now !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but finally thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted lashes ; wore tubes jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never hurt me just a hair .
&quot; there was a place in front of the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny , where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met with me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : Khar@@ kov ma Khar@@ da . that is : &quot; don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
one often says it to children if they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they thought they were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted , never beaten . &quot;
OC media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking on moral matters . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel the way people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; he who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I returned home , I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what action do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the United States .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get post@@ cards . &quot;
I won &apos;t pay a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ plau@@ ded refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : it is sil@@ ly .
&quot; this is nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to help you with fr@@ oth in front of the mouth that there are no co@@ ils with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ers have which , the cab@@ ar@@ ins have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something . &quot;
I meet so many men here from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims living in the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think in transition to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 returned the desperate situation of the Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything . &quot;
he died shortly later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab ancest@@ or , and activists on the spot warning that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights ruled that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution of the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab ancest@@ or suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of the Arab ancest@@ or community living in Iran has been sho@@ cked by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields emerging in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically refused the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fishing and palm industries . &quot;
the rate of unemployment among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi teenagers has now risen to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Cooperation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have completed a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recru@@ itment process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab ancest@@ or will be depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their li@@ veli@@ hood beyond their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; there are people who had to change their first name and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi , because even Arab names at the workplace could not be tolerated , let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab ancest@@ or endu@@ red , human rights activists hit alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional ? &quot;
taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who describe themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists .
&quot; for example , despite the same education women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later reject a glass ceiling in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware of me and well @-@ known .
I am convinced that I am double and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I mention on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under rac@@ ism and discrimination both in and out of femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decided to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their votes and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my lord &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of ra@@ cial motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two times .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t take into account myself as a black woman who ref@@ uses to consider in@@ justi@@ ces in her mind , which refers both to sex and on the skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner lam@@ ented in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historical terms is a de@@ men@@ ded and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join fac@@ tions , which are also absorbed by cultural appropri@@ ation of our customs and customs , to advance her ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer attempt to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them continue to keep silent on the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to in@@ struct them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to differenti@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ anism , which has been called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres created by us for us .
&quot; cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana vag@@ inas : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing Boss ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ anism : how we can defend ourselves ) says that we can also defend rooms in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped which the black woman is . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and on account of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment in which my life neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; again and again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Kurdist@@ an area in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect affected persons .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her spouse , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put on the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman named Bal@@ bu@@ ena for abuse , the accurate advertisement of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was not useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women give ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women are admitted to be victims of violence at all in the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , faul@@ ty implementation beats and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ yr Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 advertisements were filed for domestic violence in the District Att@@ orney Office . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace . &quot;
&quot; in the ads 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot;
&quot; on any woman who ref@@ uses ad because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this come to the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot properly document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; alone until August 2016 , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of suicide in the country . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were killed by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then she had to go . this should rep@@ ay her forever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years , she carried the psych@@ ic power on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ missive , because they are fool@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing a name , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their posts , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of ill @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen so long ago by Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse would have at least some complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria Santos , who was not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
&quot; after all , her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities stayed with no result and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a process against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it mainly focused on money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach and lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ u@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # für@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ u@@ na@@ Men@@ os are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law proposes that fem@@ ici@@ des to explain to an independent criminal record and to pun@@ ish tough@@ er as it is in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the legislative text was altered in some respects to also win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay , will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had en@@ vis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they simply reimbur@@ se and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ of@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer seen as something normal . &quot;
those who keep silent in the face of these facts contribute to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are offen@@ ded .
we have to give as long ad until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the Law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to re @-@ attack his victim .
&quot; the fil@@ ing of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered to be a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media continues to be attacked in Oman a year after bann@@ ing a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been closed on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Alb@@ anian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting of corruption in the sult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served as a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having depos@@ ited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Da@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the chief ministers of the country , Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Defence , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the insi@@ di@@ ous efforts of the security forces , especially in domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including press freedom , including press freedom , including press freedom , to torture and torture , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention of three of its editors in the last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since it was founded in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , took part . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman , to raise a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the Board of Directors , was invited by the ISS to the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS exercised the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper on all roads , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , in front of the Court in Mas@@ at , the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; both al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both con@@ vic@@ ted of distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a violation of public and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of each 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to one year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US Dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a b@@ ail of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the sentence announced . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court said to Al @-@ Abr@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the arrest of his six month prison sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison in Mas@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Afgh@@ an government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an instruction on which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the minister once again ob@@ jected to the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to restore the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
&quot; further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive infrin@@ gement of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) ur@@ ges the authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j to release promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; 2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances make sure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and adjacent states through the promotion of freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather together peac@@ efully , and offers them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research carried out locally . there are two reasons for a lack of medicine and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe effects in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists will help to establish their own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus itself before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ á@@ b health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
AG@@ M : what do you think about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only set up solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being a maker . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
AG@@ M : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : United States and Europe .
the projects are supported in a variety of ways .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
AG@@ M : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is an interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; AG@@ A : how large is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , study of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are only accessible for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers will change world food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ standing Blue , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been limited by its own imagination and the question of how many types of salad it can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cro@@ oked leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as grain or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition Mort@@ on is still breeding a salad , but it takes longer since his work becomes more difficult by ever increasing constraints . &quot;
it is as if in a river there is a b@@ oul@@ der lying around which I have to go .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far at Sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand up to court , no one can breed a new salad bar , because all features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very cau@@ tious and stri@@ ves to use no material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger and bigger in the USA and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( open source bree@@ ders ) .
&quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman let@@ tu@@ ce at the &quot; &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; &quot; of the station . it is tested on whether plants can be grown in space . &quot;

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT arena and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; it has been created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , so that plant bree@@ ders can be used permanently . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US bree@@ ders can ob@@ lige themselves to be able to freely use the seeds cultivated by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy their seed to breed it to breed their own varieties , and it does not immediately spy - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the accredited professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , we have control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to it , seed plays a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try not to use the latter or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the open @-@ source movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants may be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 9 ( Turkish ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 10 ( Latin 6 )
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making their seed freely available to others . thus , their action is in contrast to patent seeds and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available genetic pool is based on the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material that is therefore always available without ce@@ asing .
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has specialised in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; there are no such estimates for other plants yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that m@@ ish@@ ly cultivated plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
plants are bred so that they have specifically desired features - from those through which their taste or colour improves up to such as they thri@@ ve in certain environments and prevent threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bree@@ ders decreases by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse forecast by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to ackno@@ wle@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow as soon as the patent ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
&quot; thus , such protection does not hin@@ der innovations , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the other : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires ; certainly no innovations .
&quot; and if one has to wait so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight already . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders do not have time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make farmers work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us forward , and it is made impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the features themselves . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as bree@@ ders we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if you breed a variety , you also breed its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mono@@ cultures , are needed for their cultivation of mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , bred in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such , who move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most of the smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the opinion that bree@@ ders would become more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new and stronger than companies that patented .
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue since I know my competitors will sell my varieties for themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you have been protected from competition for 20 years with a patent . &quot; worldwide response &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is an open source seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to get to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ col is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding are different from country to country , so the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law yet ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for seed pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for open source seed systems , states that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for the planned launch of the official launch . &quot;
&quot; a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups ( among them Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and centr@@ ation ) has assembled a database about seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a context , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that soon more people will recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has particularly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems hardly played a role , &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest cens@@ orship goals in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , docum@@ enting the violations of human rights in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August , the Network published an opinion on Facebook in which it sharp@@ ly critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true , despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are committed to defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored site of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar Network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
notice that it is not posible to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researchers Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer exists in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spreading of columns and articles , which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now , the blog he directed to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ or apparatus , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Blog@@ ger , who is also given a home to the Canadian blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how the police pursued physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the fact that blogs are very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege , an arrest , an attempted murder , a sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , al@@ beit only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles in order to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities locked up 133 web pages from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , af@@ te documented the blocking of vendors , where Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing was possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ PN@@ s offer began . &quot;
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering the contents that Egyptian users might have access to .
&quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian people have no legal basis with which they can proceed to court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian army is working in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; daily newspapers in Brazil reported head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves smoke chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , na@@ vy and air coffee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 violence wave in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called for the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; for detailed coverage of violence in Rio , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published on August 16th , &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens in Rio is published in the &quot; War in Rio &quot; section . ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a 4 minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , explained that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the editorial the newspaper continues :
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police that only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to cover . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; be used more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l , journalist , Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , ar@@ gues against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negle@@ ct of public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mor@@ nings per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is dedicated to the fact that , as Cec@@ í@@ lia empha@@ sizes , the state security policy has been repeated for years . &quot;
&quot; this security policy also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police station and to permanently station@@ ing a unit there . &quot;
&quot; initially , this led to a decrease of violent deaths . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux , from one of his articles from 2010 , stated why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this , penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; in which a civilian is a non @-@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; distor@@ ted bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , the fact is that the residents of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; one week ago , the police attacked the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a man of fruit died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities are suffering from brutal sieg@@ es and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a joint initiative by the Peace Organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute , The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the East G@@ hou@@ ta Region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition come out , on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these areas have been controlled by rebels outside of Damascus under si@@ ege , which caused residents to be transported locally or through tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the commonly grown foods in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ torate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we op@@ ted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because it is possible to plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years he has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now gaining recognition . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian cro@@ w@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of plant@@ ing fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used in plastics in order to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of fung@@ us seeds from the regions , &quot; before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; after that , they planted a little fung@@ al farm in a tub . when this was done , they used a bigger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the start of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to contribute to the people of mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking the si@@ ege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc ) for the production of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities bound to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege are visible . &quot;
&quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas , and we can help humanity . &quot;

the Portuguese demanded justice for the victims of the 2017 fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that took place in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this resulted in the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
&quot; fires have also been registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 dead . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bur@@ sts spread in the northern and central regions of the country , and about 250 million hectares of forest and many villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy happened , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , approximately 500,000 acres of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
to give you a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .

the Visi@@ ble tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the government of the farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
they did this Sunday nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , construction permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had submitted to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ able by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means for self @-@ protection , that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us drew attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of light inflamm@@ able wood , are increasingly spreading like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems are related to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal was seeking information on 15 and 16 October when people sought information , or were trying to contact relatives who were offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they took advantage of their own civil protection data with the help of the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial that the servers did not stand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the Fo@@ under asked for help :

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , was in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the last time together with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother did not say it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - perhaps never again . &quot;
in the dawn the boy was to break .
his un@@ cle would pick it up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly feeling def@@ enc@@ eless . &quot;
the Taliban known for their hatred on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban were getting closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
&quot; for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ room pit , working hard and sick . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars , who were he@@ avier than himself , in order to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was dominated by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no service there and no heating . we hang@@ ed n@@ ylon in front of the open windows to prevent us from freezing at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time , A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to aid need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high rates of twin rates . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special centres of reception , &quot; which involves impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have submitted an application for asylum - which can still withdraw after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers for months . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible li@@ veli@@ hood helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack @-@ bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ an @-@ owned companies emerged , including dres@@ s@@ making , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu tells the story of their trip to Italy by the different Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a pizz@@ eria in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic industry and retail , and go back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also gre@@ ets plans for the opening of a Kab@@ ul factory where people can learn about packaging and learning techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harv@@ ests on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; in order to protect social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , has been in custody for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the dism@@ iss@@ al of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill , suggest@@ ing that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would have to register in order to use social networks within six months after the submission of the law on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the en@@ rol@@ ment of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which was adverti@@ sed by sixty members of parliament , is currently before the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of parliament filed a legislative proposal that would be introduced in the tough@@ er sentences for the ins@@ ult of the president or high officials . &quot;
&quot; under the law proposition , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts at Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian police , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inaugur@@ ation of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just like 700 protest participants arrested at the same incident , four years in jail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May because the prison leadership , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused to prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;

&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted of two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the alties of journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the a@@ forementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;

&quot; in May , Tun@@ isian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly li@@ stens to a victorious action plan . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , according to the plan , was explicitly supported by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali . &quot;
&quot; the document published on the Na@@ wa@@ at webpage on 21 April , sheds light on how the prev@@ ent@@ ative plans will look for the support of the legislation . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources stating article 11 of the Tun@@ isian press code which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , at the District Court in Tunis on May 9th , he appeared as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force users of social media to submit their identification ?
&quot; according to new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
the regulations also indicate that the registration with full real name will be required .
analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within social networks . it is un@@ clear until now how the authorities will apply these provisions .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect civil journ@@ alism and its independence .
&quot; do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the State cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; ISO @-@ 2022 @-@ j@@ p ( Japanese , email ) eu@@ c @-@ k@@ r ( Korean ) &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian Government has a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . &quot;
&quot; these websites currently include web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ bol@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru , and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court decre@@ es blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court decre@@ ed the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ speaking articles , the indications , Turkey support the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication has announced that the site has been closed because it is &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups in order to raise a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , alongside others , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop re@@ bu@@ ff@@ ing
&quot; following this week , the UK government is located in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor and install their communications channels , de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies with regard to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
