<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, dancing to American music, American authors read and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist for an American movie."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to Method Man," "I was like it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA was only reinforced."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party ever reached."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was not able to reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believer person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps also agreed to view the world view by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns while playing.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her lifetime, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel has helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love towards America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump made his way to nominate republican presidential candidates, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"it turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency gave a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt to non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they had either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters to be assists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorize people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, would they perhaps say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"but you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contempt to those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(meaning" White against all the other ethnicities ")," white in reference to the whites and Whiplash, "as the great Van Jones said, has just killed what America did so splendidly."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have, America is welcome everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyans, whose history, as he says himself, would nowhere else be possible in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, if my son, captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no," the crowd roared. "</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried and their voices cried louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous and loud" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find any place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="70">"the music played at both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with the..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, La banda de música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and banal violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after an accidental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered youth such a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"always smiling and playing with shiny eyes and play in the turbo you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura are playing a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments manufactured from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments composed of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers began to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all produced out of the waste."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early times:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash. the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra which plays instruments of reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">"a documentation called" "Landfill Harmonic" "(Harmonic Mülldeponie) records the musical performance:"</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about a billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental issues."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship already had illegal fishing in the Liberian waters before it looked for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were accordingly brought up accordingly, and little inclined to welcome a criminal law of this species at its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were swiftly mobilized against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused." "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at his time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 launched by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"besides Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that at that time had driven the prime minister out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this, we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand out from each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, why it is extremely difficult to detect."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the intentional disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecosystems which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, actions happen today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange existing licenses, updates on suspicious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open sea via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships that are fishing in forbidden areas, such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were travelling and possibly whether they have a criminal record."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay punishment as in the Fall of the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, head director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the so-called platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which will lose eight members of the HISH network every year due to illegal fishing that penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, quoting of phantasies, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they deliberately use the lack of international co-operation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbridled control system, "says Long."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">"up to now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies suspected of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It discovered crime networks that had distributed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has persecuted and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships they like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishing companies use sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so that they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminally operating ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently SkyTruth has launched the platform global Fishing Watch together with Google and the ocean protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data, and by means of which the position of each traceable ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - it simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project, in which a global system allows tracking of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also discourage them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously fished without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH countries now have a 33% increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to trace the Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board of towing nets."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are an object of study." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear every year due to illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries have joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they too fight against illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's youngest member state of Somalia could announce its first major triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag. and not only was the ship operated without a license and were used towing nets, which are meanwhile prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "by taking measures against Greko 1 they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>
<seg id="152">"their articles appear in Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and the Guardian."</seg>
<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seems to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro's official release.</seg>

<seg id="158">"under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the re-recovery of Venezuela), both images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found."</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among other things, in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the central-north-located Bundestaat (Carabobo) and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>
<seg id="160">"the political and economic situation of the country worsens continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication."</seg>
<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro had the chance of a fundamental change, but in the end the posture of a re-election was blocked by official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government committee as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"as part of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the end of the year), and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"the election campaign, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups were united in the elections of 2015, was to continue to oppose the election of the President Nicolás Maduro."</seg>

<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">"in the situation at that time, I thought it was ok."</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>

<seg id="229">'cause the prisoners' tortured</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barrack where cars, furniture, television, fridges - were simply everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver in it."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I approached and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they mounted the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the person's body which was lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely bind a man with handcuffs to the bed, overthrew him with water and hunted him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: Comisión Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there was horrible... like a dirty diaper.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated with handcuffs and wore eye bonds."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke to" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian, who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked human beings were lying with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people chewed quietly on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why did you get me here?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me home about it.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero made a man there and killed a man there.</seg>
<seg id="260">"(according to the testimony of survivors, the civilian is Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla-Ribera process, the student Raúl Mateo Molina to death)."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, the director of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way where the kidnapped came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you will see that they took about this route and then tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement from above came that they should be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was a lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'Awardsmen'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">"at that time at age, I had no idea what the" "war" "- as they called it - was."</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was at the military later, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war spoils are a bayonet or perhaps military emblem that one has fought against an enemy that is fought against."</seg>

<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could take part in this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I'd never really like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my dad could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I answered," "And you, who steal cars on the road?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded rage, struck me and screamed:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"when you go so far, I will find you and kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else to do that!</seg>
<seg id="284">So was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a pullover sweater of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still made clothes with home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence, a conjurer accused me of being in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay my burden on what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>

<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, you recognize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you have executed people during the dictatorship. but why do the bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl back home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"again and again I asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They would have simply been able to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why do their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Were these people not also families who could be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act that man can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when the democracy was reintroduced, they picked up machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were grinded and taken away somewhere - no idea where." "you will never find anything," "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But something always remains.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to clarify it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie myself.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him reproaches because of all the atrocities that I had to experience because of him.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I didn't kill anybody."</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt inwardly rejected and asked me why all the exaggerated patriotism and the "Western and Christian sentiments" that they supposedly defended were actually good.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I screamed:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he replied," "Well, then show me."</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">"in 2010, I made the first advertisement."</seg>
<seg id="322">Finally I realized that he was a criminal.</seg>

<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence, in the last month, witnessed a very special mischievous translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"in a sign the Japanese word" "sarcopepochs" "(koreibelsha)," "older motorists" "means wrongly - but perhaps also with malicious backwardness & # 8212; as" "awful motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September in electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Joshua Levine's original photos which has been widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">"the fault was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun magazine published in Kyoto wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city such as Kyoto, simply unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was first removed. the term" "drivers drivers" "was later replaced by the more appropriate, although grammatically incorrect designation" "drivers" "(German:" older drivers ") were replaced."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto Prefecture excused for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apologies:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sincerely sorry that older people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">Japanese online news service J-Cast News became more detailed with the phenomenon of "terrible" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" fearful "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the share of older motorists who are involved in accidents across the country, however, is quite a reason for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, equivalent to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1.803 of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, their share increased to 17.7%."</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has declined overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">The named reporter published in the published version of the article published comments to the light who apparently prejudices some Japanese apparently against older motorists:</seg>
<seg id="367">"among other things, the Yahoo article about the translation errors has received the following comments:"</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally the conviction is that translators should not be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ any staff with English as their native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, expenses or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still make translations in the company-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English language skills are considered the best, is the translator - no matter how good or bad their language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with merry results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and mysterious sentences, which arise by automated translation, show that this technique cannot replace any human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including puzzling prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but by large companies or by the government, who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more accurate translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto uses a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"she who has become something," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers its age-old son or her underage daughter to another, wealthier family. in exchange, the child receives food, an apprenticeship and a roof above the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned, however, is that the children must pay for a number of days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a treaty that cannot be raised."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, known as Criaazgo, is widespread in Paraguay due to its involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organizations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she talked with Criadita - especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is being vaccinated for the Criadiana guarantees in general silence."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Crimean Azgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they can complete their education, improve their position in society and" "make something of themselves" "are handed over to another family."</seg>

<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of heavy blows. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military officer, Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who worked as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants situated 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira defeated a stick to Marín until she suffered lethal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported on the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela blamed the practice of Criadazgo deep in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Crimean Azgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained. "</seg>

<seg id="450">"without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations requested a prompt investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>

<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at 5 o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"Fridays for example clean the fridge, cleaned up the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner it was finished with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but she didn't get unlimited food." I was allowed to bring more books from the master's library as food from the refrigerator, "she remembers."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathisers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power between 1954 and 1989."</seg>
<seg id="469">"in some evenings, the host Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as" Sendero "or" El Pueblo. ""</seg>
<seg id="470">"in doing so, he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of dictator."</seg>
<seg id="471">"he thought she was intelligent, but did not entertain her." the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics, "she says."</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently agreed to draft legislation on "regulating the use and usage of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when it is accepted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law a place would then be established, which was commissioned to use citizens to grant permission to grant social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it failed to do so, it could bring about a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraphs and circulated in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs on the Internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice, video messages and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is assumed, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration process. it is unclear that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyadh Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and Promoter of the Legislative Council, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and a password to get through the firewall that blocked Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to this, it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not been known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>

<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court case."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed with parliament and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>

<seg id="526">"a subtype of the larger family of leopards, which strives through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor)."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"how Raza shows in the video," "Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on the fact that a big predator exists."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore states that they have a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="544">"a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima triggered the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a state prefectures in Japan's northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had let whole coastal cities disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, the Fukushima prefecture had an atomic accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding and the survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that until December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare homes (foreman proletariat survived, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures was reported by Miyagi, 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"nevertheless, even six years after the catastrophe, it is still possible to relocate to final replacement homes, even six years after the disaster, evacuated from Behel shelters (Caucasetsu juutaku)."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such shelters."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened their doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are back in operation, only 30 percent of fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident occurred extensively in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of land destroyed by 5 400 hectares of land of Fukushima lie in the" nuclear block zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered, but also here Fukushima stays down well."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers think it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to obtain an overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated."</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken steps to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed found that still not enough in catastrophes prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its issue to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has increasingly focused its attention on the position of the evacuated from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to witness not only the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, disaster-induced, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement homes."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuated people who are still in homes are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima compete with massive building projects."</seg>

<seg id="626">"with the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso's law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed doors (Photo: Julio Batista)"</seg>
<seg id="627">"Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the Western Cuban province of Maydique, is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar cane in the village."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after harvesting, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some were changing the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a veteran veteran, who stands up every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are back into operation because they have been preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene recalls exactly that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvest has not yet been a new one."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why has the Cuban sugar cane industry been turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the community already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and they were barely competitive for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about $85 million for the country."</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will certainly go into history," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero. "</seg>
<seg id="653">"from then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began."</seg>
<seg id="654">"in the following years, the breastfeeding of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further education."</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the Gregorio Arlée Mañalich's sugar cane factory on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeats most," scam. ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">"in order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group."</seg>
<seg id="660">"before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come."</seg>
<seg id="661">"it was officially authored documents, which were only distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and date."</seg>
<seg id="662">"all were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="663">"from then on, the responsibility was postponed and the letters were more and more frequent."</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation."</seg>
<seg id="665">"Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma."</seg>

<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important worktop producer was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">"in many cases, there were no alternatives to work places and services generated in the communities in which they were located."</seg>
<seg id="670">"we will never know whether during the mammoth speech of October 21, 2002, the then president was looking into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would go well."</seg>

<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the sphere of the KitSumcalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also" Highway of tears, "a section in West Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases have mostly not been elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey, how important is the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always master the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapskoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in circulation, as well as a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is located exactly on the menu, close to the entrance to shokuhin sanpuru (proposed projection of the" "sculptural models of the dishes" ") is issued by any food that is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a large number of small businesses that produce those sculptural dishes, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend turns them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver matome the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos show this unusual twist with shokuhin sancriu.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile ribbons decorated with plastic sheets as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essentials is becoming increasingly more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case the emperor-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple which keeps your mobile phone holding:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comedy.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile stand and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, Ikura or salmon-roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say:" wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon. ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes may also take a less appetizing form, for example, to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and hand-made ribbons made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">You can view more skurrile plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag # mushporn by using the help of the hashtag # seemingly screensavers.</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the blends and killed regularly occur in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle carries with them."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Netítico has launched the digital project" Apring a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" living with drug trafficking "), telling stories of people involved in the fight between criminal prosecution authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político is describing the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who is seeking secret graves for every weekend according to his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who in only one day lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "like every Sunday, we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and look for tombs, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">"Guadalupe Contreras:" "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata."</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13 he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he should be back again, but he never came back." Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but she does not pay her out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get those? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts that show fragility and state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a researcher of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with illness and sensation journalism for a couple of years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with images, which can only come from a textbook for criminals or from specialists from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it seems like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become a member of Narco (German: drug traffickers) if he is big. and it is not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone, and those who fear that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">"I see our weakness, when stories become mere numbers in a statistic."</seg>
<seg id="788">"the intimelessness of people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring place are justified with the fact that they were" based. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade that they are spared from such tragedies if they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the Capital District: how a family with threats was looted."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of this never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes back up when you are alone."</seg>

<seg id="794">We will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are apart, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I wondered in these terrible days if weeping would solve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to cry. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez" ": a generation managed by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, sown potatoes, make tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood had been over two years before, when he was just a few blocks from his home, who saw bloody bodies of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed with the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Civil Security and Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the prosecution had 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 counts per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Apring a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been misleading to capture tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the town Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people came to life."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country was neglected for years and devastated."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"authorities' representatives described a fireball, the dozens of houses enveloped, including a cinema nearby, which was full of people watching the football world championships."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses are plastered and charred bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" This is Nigeria. "from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the dreadful scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonated bodies that are strung out on the ground while persons watching them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed real but not associated tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Witnesses reported dramatic of atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one left to count corpses," "said a resident of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were crushed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only using satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated metaphorically."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again as proof of the fact and extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has documented assignment to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">"one more step further, personal comments like this example wrongly falsely relate the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning message released by the United Nations, those who could flee could strike blows, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following reported these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page, which in 2012 claimed that the president of Myanmar's Than Being said, monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to see this information."</seg>

<seg id="924">"other accounts, aggregators and pages in the following countries (on the portfolio in grey), however, are not completely traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murders of the Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are desensitizing and deprive them of the ability to feel empathy (such as this study which investigated how violent media interacts to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used in the context or in a completely abusive way."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, each investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="944">"a blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. insurmountable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not to translate at all."</seg>

<seg id="946">Some of these unrivalled words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese sauda) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>

<seg id="948">"a word or expression suffices not, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of" untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the VAT-lap language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "vakasteglok" "- Fatigue for your parents in recognition of your efforts in your younger years."</seg>
<seg id="953">"words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "kwadi" "- The comfort or laziness that one feels after being warmed in the sun during cold days."</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language storytelling initiative (TLS), the number of stories in her original language is a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unrivalled blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite such small languages will not be passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure rooms in which residents do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening is often connected with it," "try these events instead" "listening to appreciate, to make."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their dedication and representation lead to the audience's audience."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cause laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"for example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou conate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art typical for their country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamusara tells the babel from the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the importance of his Fabel, John Nyamusara is asked:" "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "with a wide grin he shares his feelings of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>

<seg id="1155">"the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which rose to 72 million US dollars, took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017; the march started at the puertoriental Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of re-fixing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people Puerto Ricos demands that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, our working conditions appropriate remuneration, which acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be rewarded with declining pension payments.</seg>

<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is freely available here is a series of papers dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for Free knowledge are built and what the real costs are to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side on page to look over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the directory of the Adra Prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we haven't had any information about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own fates, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process from time-time extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and Digital Activist has been in custody by Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military institution."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police "Bassel had taken on the basis of a command of the military tribunal taken from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and notified them of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his whereabouts and condition remains unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel plays a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently crossing the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes were predicted to be the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross-crossing of numerous civilizations."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural legacy of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this expedient to digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel has not yet been able to complete this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life with freedom to dream and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I have learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prosular cloth she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger at a corruption case, where a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants for the embezzlement of 54 million Metics (about 800,000 Euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique whose advice Cambaza was between 2005 and 2008.</seg>

<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the motion, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to resume his old post as the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people do not welcome the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integrida de Pública (CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to re-address the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate disciplinary proceedings against the conflicting.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company, however, apparently and did not initiate appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" disgusting. ""</seg>

<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>

<seg id="1287">"the Burmese word" "Kalar Pae" "means chickpeas or splice."</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported "</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or manuscript widths schemes (in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely decreasing connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" Kalar "may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically generate hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts where they discussed the use of the word were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, the chair is written on Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (spider), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"but he asked his friends in a witty way, whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to Facebook's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"in the opinion that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, Zin win also emphasised that Facebook must be more analytic before all posts loosened suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the words next."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to trim their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new Facebook rule, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to copy, post and share content for 24 hours because the post" "Facebook Community standards did not meet."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are poor."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words such as" chair "or" pea curry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the fake braces."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million usefulness, which would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided for a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate language but still have been removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the Burmese text is" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film."</seg>
<seg id="1332">"just to try out whether Facebook removes the post, which contains the word Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"the post says" If you are a doctor, then heal people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech is meant to heighten violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for his failure to bring out the proliferous hate speech on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better in context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, the Parliament voted unanimously in favour of a law that should prohibit this practice, so that the marriage-proof age is now at 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, since the age does not determine maturity."</seg>

<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who were married to 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the statistical Central Office of the Land confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19 in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements, trying to create laws for children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu-leader, for example, had no hesitation to say to the critics of the children's marriage, they should pay attention to their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition meant tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, who could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country has to agree and let the law be announced.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not one on the other.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"once it has been decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a law."</seg>

<seg id="1390">"by mirroring websites, Turkish users can see Wikipedia contents again"</seg>
<seg id="1391">"the English-language Wikipedia site was presented on 18 January 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally darkened."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">"for over a month, Turkey now blocks the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many techniques-versed Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked web pages (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the best-known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform continues to remain locked, there are now several mirror sites (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform lay down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. host machine connections), which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (about the block of Wikipedia), we put it all about putting snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility of reading the contents on decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites, if blocked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as staff at Mozilla at the Panigrahi's Open Speaks Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"it is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror."</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see is by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">"essentially, the server redirects the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia ourselves when they are locked in Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepalese wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was lying and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he rose from face to face from face to face."</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot interfere with the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Buehill appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, it avoids women with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or" "father of my child." ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should ignore the norm to keep this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a pseudo-court and expelled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married family."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives also not by name is also widespread among men. however, they have far fewer inflictions to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, presented a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"it is a place for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is run by the Video Volunteers community and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children's orphanages to exile from HIV- and AIDS infected persons and manages this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how this club created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing Rohini in their discussion rounds consisted of women who do not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to pronounce the name of their husbands, is a custom that they all be dutiful and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not observe this will be regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning Rohini, who had never named her husband at the name, wanted to try at home as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion club with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked them all," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does this mean that they don't respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands on their lips," "says Rohini Pawas of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition where married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that she only cashed in front of herself during the whole practice; another decided to release the whole frustrations against him and his family by cursing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation dealt with violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, showing the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinnoberRed point if he did."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not quit altogether, but they think they are now in a better position to choose to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip to every discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear something," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things, for example how our identities are tied to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say things loudly, no matter how small they are."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only wore saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a salty-kurta, a wide shirt about a pants, they did not dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of its own dress code, morals connected to the saris and much more, Rohini added their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) to a discussion round, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will make it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women rehearsed it a few times, but then again they stopped saying the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including myself, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and are not members of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now bear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the panel know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or their own clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it's not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tell other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from excluded groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" messages of those who experience it themselves, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1552">"for just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese spin through."</seg>
<seg id="1553">People here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">"the music of the cult band is" more than just a universal language like English, "Ryuichi Isaka, president of retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review."</seg>
<seg id="1556">"dear readers, as these audiobooks are in German, it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language."</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">"the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo, in the international community, attracted attention after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was admitted to hospital because of liver cancer."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for" "Subversion" "(state threat), having participated in the design of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demands democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius as an" an internal affair, "and a spokesman tells him that he was not required to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China continues to release calls from the international community, Nobel Prize winner and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, to release him or to give him treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised several foreign reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>

<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway fell into a bump after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately was nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were continued in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon-exports to China, since exports since 2010 were largely blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"having spread the message that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"during the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair."</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth-Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June to release the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the request of the US Embassy broke out a furious answer from China, with the foreign ministry's statement that" no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations."</seg>

<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been strictly punished, led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association meeting, the minister pointed out that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, most people make a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one can say that we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons led by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" normal countries. ""</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, both cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre of the authoritarian rulers appear to be democrats forgiving, leaving the distorted logic, since it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"the final week of Shanmugam the answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were really no answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinions as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, provided he was paid highly to be part of the Government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his commentary on the blog, he points to the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was more of a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneven important even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore is not a country," he obviously did not mean it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, making such a polemic statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassing..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that is another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the Singapore political leaders, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discloses the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "benign a mistake" "or was it a cheating spokesman?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they not defend their city?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister Invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I have not said what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defence of the country in particular "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak more about the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices recently asked his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home country or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">"your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series, revealing rumours about certain parts of the world and to show another facet."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question which is most asked in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry, I answer." I'm from Canada. "since 1994 I live and again in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that makes us different from American people."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried little maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">"all seem to think, Canada is so great."</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We clearly say very often "apologies."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends, whom I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't matter to me if you would like to change me with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: to be called" nice "means to be idle - like the good-natured, gentle, but wearingly insignificant figure Ned Flanders out of" Die Simpsons "(who has his own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from things that happen around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a major part of the Canadian."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"what outside standing as" "nice" "is perhaps just chilly courtesy."</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness, which I now connect with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada pretty sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a pop-band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that odizes the Junta, which in 2014 took the power and in spite of her promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">"in the first three days alone, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times and received 8,800 lights."</seg>
<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" The Dictator "was blocked in Thailand, after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it acts with the situation of the country under the junta regime."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these recordings of the video, which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has been pursuing in the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" "44 rules of the girls" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the Army absolute decision-making over important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th Rule:" change your attitude "refers to the notorious program for the" adjustment change "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals who are considered as critics of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose there was also set up a new unity in the army, which monitors online content and prosecutes individuals who are accused of having killed the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict law against "Majeste" (Majestic Trip).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014 the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">"two days later, it came to a coup in the army."</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the problems which the junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van, before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison, because they allegedly created" confusion "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1799">"meanwhile, the teaser of the songs showed members of the band that imitated the Salut" The Hunger Games of Panem, "which was already used by Putsch-opponents during the 2014 protests."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez introduces a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, on the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on the website of our partner PRI.org on 19 April 2017 and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59th-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and golden earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2.50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haiti immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms Ramírez, the people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some also slept on board."</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys them medications that they cannot afford, they massage them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychicque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a moustache) posing with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he responds with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with her sister, hoping to get to Boston where she finds her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the route and that Africans already speak at Whatsapp by Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy weakened, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Ms. Ramírez notes that their guests are often sending text messages when they are gone to greet them, or to report on their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is well known here, but it is not the only sparking hope for the migrants travelling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have picked up migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his home for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled with his wife and his three children in Honduras without having to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single one, has offered him a roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next steps."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, the travelers see quietly their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she blends in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair care, who made her a Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she briefly introduces her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats it every time. "they have gone already."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang from Twitter-Users copyable Terminologies</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi have received a cell phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance App called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app will prevent you from accessing terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had already installed messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would determine and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks, and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web sites, from online fraud, trojans, and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reports on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, displaced ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and monitoring measures as well as routine internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"based on Twitter based media outlet" Images from In China, "censored news published in China showed photos of a checkpoint in which police officers checked the residents indiscriminately if they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">Mobile alerts prompted people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you arrive at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" China, "also issued a Jingwang-product description, from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thereby receives unlimited access to the computer's hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office while operating their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities released on 27 June in a district of Urumqi in a district of Urumqi to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously any" terrorist videos "to identify and destroy. however, this promotion violates the personal rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and grants them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1994">This is the first of six reports in the series "sleep or death" in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"far from our blue, virtual world, you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable, both from inside and outside."</seg>
<seg id="1997">One who makes all honor to her name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has crushed into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when the reality recurs you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood, and all cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts melt in smoke and you will be aware of your existence, even when the Earth is on the axis of the Light. you realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have arrested me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for me to" learn my lesson "as the chief of the Security Service had formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"during a peaceful protest, five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2004">"it was sufficient to allow the city to break the darkness of the night with" "Allahu Akbar" "screams."</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all the neighborhoods coveted, only my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I did not put high demands on a city that is stuffed up into the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had calmed down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke the silence by crying several times "Allahu Akbar" from my home roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I listened to my voice through silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt courageous enough to find together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we joined us to a gorgeous picture that filled my expectations completely and completely."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment, you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp, but it simply does not interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet with the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you screamed it all the way to the office of security service from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Colonel Ghassan begins to speak:" "let me hear how you write 'Allahu Akbar', or you are brave enough to shout if we are not near."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes were directed toward me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you trust in my eyes, and not on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was in my folly, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">"I was so sure, as I replied," I didn't think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday. "</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I have never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret any word about what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement, and his father is the same with that."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father is the same with that."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The constriction of this accursed sentence is up to this day in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" syndrome, "a mental torture that I was exposed for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I pierced the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I wear with me.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a walk to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I prestole all the details exactly before I cared for the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"otherwise, they probably have allocated a larger cell this time."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share them with only one more prisoner and can immediately set me up without waiting for their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the officials left the cell, and I attacked a tried and tested communication method: to fight against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my trophy was a "self-sacrifice."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was an eminent middle-aged man, who looks similar to me and called" the doctor. ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in the perfect darkness, no prominent facial features can be seen on me, and doctors don't exist here; we are all only numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice sounds like mine?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers denied its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"the investigator had assured me, they would release him if I remain."</seg>
<seg id="2048">(no Selection)</seg>
<seg id="2049">"I would like to have had a scarecrow to expel all these crows, which labelled on the fruit in my head's garden."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"from afar, I still hear them cry" Allahu Akbar. ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">"it must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the cries are open, every day."</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that black is the colour of perdition until I saw the yellow light, which presented us the horror in person: the Raad (for example:" thunder, "allusions to 13.) of the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be heard.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"in order to protect the betrayer and the terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - thus they played their confessional blackmail and betrayed the narrow vision of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house, that is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I cared for the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me like that."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant "conversation, despite the facial expressions that escapes him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start doing so much more important with your life than to join this day-day and to protest demonstrations that will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to reply.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can't say exactly when insults and blows have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"one voice in me said that I had to get used to it or to get used to it, even though I didn't have done anything to earn that sentence."</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear myself as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this loving "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold your cries back."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cries were not yet enough for him, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I wondered if the investigator had worked as a garbage collector sooner or if it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cables intertwined in order to present us, from their point of view, a great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within one hour three of them alternate, while I was still in the line."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the hangman remarked the cooling and didn't find any favors about it, which is why it turned next to an electrically charged rod."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed all my body, enough to supply my entire neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The deafness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to put myself to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed away that happened to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." Raus with you, asshole. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted teenager:" "my Lord, my father has to worry about dreadful things."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be still, and get away, you will be laid."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can leave is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel was forced to flee their occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as rocky (example: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her well-tried opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking, and can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not openly admit it, he has a particular dislike against US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as" Palestinian refugees of the second generation, "he refers to himself even when he was born in Jordan, and so far never was in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he pours in water Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the lukeg lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially if you have a look at the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, one avoids having to do basic things - as in public during Ramadan, drinking water, in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual slave woman Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert announcement was."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MEP and former spokesman of the Islamic coalition, Dima Tahbb said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "just" "was canceled because of sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which is questioning the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila overestimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement might not be simply a simple rhetoric, but in fact an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan reflected in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib moved to Leibe's traditional gender standards by educated his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently dull unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of 'Honour killings' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside left."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "be kept in jail for indefinite time", "and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman has nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well known to not shy away from topics that were long as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, and cannot separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was intimidated by politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" "Edward Sa'ed", "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats quite often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words," can get what you want "- be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been strongly censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to later point out that his comments were torn from context, distorted and censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but was only a machined version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib openly campaigned for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuclear, a poet of the eighth century, who remains in memory still today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nueva was to work on behalf of the caliphs later, in the eighth century openly about homosexuality could write, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, says Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service took several former members of government and members of the teacher association, stating that they would have critically expressed themselves critically to the problems associated with the corruption that were deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mr. Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it is certain that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature on real and basic openness - and not by bombs, streumps and artificial ways. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as it is, Hdaib will continue and therefore also offer resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big and extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory states that the strongholds invaded from the west of Japan to the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>

<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy school, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to exchange young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in the hairdresser's art which enables them to find work."</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the "declaration of love to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel expelled to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation) that encourages young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historical event, and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was considered as significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak about a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years and who were exposed to war rhetoric around the clock, must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, who had become accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take into its ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian had to join and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - which should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter to reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk soon with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent encouragement."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have their place in society and have to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a story of war a common history of peace," "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I never thought I would forgive me" ""</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipal Administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally convey the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they did before in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive any orders, but letters of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings can be traversed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a representative of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him lying on the bed a MGL garnet was lying, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I answered him anyway and said," "Hello, what do they do?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I answered it." then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry about the war, it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected something else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from hunger." "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there that is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices:</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the beginning, students and some leaders of the FARC were joined to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"this is why the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organisation, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the entire Colombian people worked out. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear those people who have never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I've often seen as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and done so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and embrace."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Morío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"according to the Colombians, it was prophesied that after disarmament peace would rule."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there are inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to take up arms, rise and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call upon all the defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with horrors, activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a Damoklash over the local LGBTQ community has not yet emerged over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what happened in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines several months ago, after reports published which addressed the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after having experienced Chechens from the gender equation of their landlady, hunting was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"out of fear for her life, she moved to the USA last end."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he'd be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" "then there are no more men in Chechnya, who can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents got the round through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just getting a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying:" here's a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechen:" "how long do you want to dishonour the family, you Schandstack?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not thirty years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to get along and started shouting.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitch wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC media: in which cases were you laid - in which men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are out-of-date, there is my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time in his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I got threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that this was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they set absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was just bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have cup size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world not only your family, but the whole republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a devout woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a snck around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with darkened windows and a license plate with a 95."</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends reviewed the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering me, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't believe, you're in safety just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about gender equation, this is a taboos issue."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditionally Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I desire, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to see how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do to those who have stayed behind?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not exclude a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"in this way, I mean, they probably download their relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped from their relatives to face Kadyrow's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply vanished, but deliberately immersed in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or have you got a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already happened in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, before 2003, I was already well known in the whole of Grosny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously now!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally intended to bring us to" "civilisation", "but finally thrown us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted lashes; wore tubes jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never hurt me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"there was a place in front of the Russian theater in Grosny, where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met with me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharkov ma Kharda. that is: "don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">One often says it to children if they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they thought they were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never offended me, never hunted, never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking on moral matters."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel the way people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who had laughed and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I returned home, I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly worsened."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacreffs, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get postcards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I won't pay a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I applauded refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: it is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"this is nature, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to help you with froth in front of the mouth that there are no coils with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagesters have which, the cabarins have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there is it - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men here from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims living in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think in transition to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be exact, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry, I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 returned the desperate situation of the Arab ancestor community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family, so Ahwazi's human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab ancestor, and activists on the spot warning that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights ruled that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution of the Iranian government, to feed their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab ancestor suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large part of the Arab ancestor community living in Iran has been shocked by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields emerging in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population gets little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically refused the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fishing and palm industries."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The rate of unemployment among the Arab Ahawzi teenagers has now risen to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Cooperation, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have completed a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arab ancestor will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livelihood beyond their homeland Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first name and surname to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi, because even Arab names at the workplace could not be tolerated, let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab ancestor endured, human rights activists hit alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, even with the intersectional?"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Taken by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who describe themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, despite the same education women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later reject a glass ceiling in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware of me and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I mention on skin colour, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused under racism and discrimination both in and out of feminist movement, many white feminists decided to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift up their votes and "Kumbaya, my lord" to achieve equality (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racial motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to the school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't take into account myself as a black woman who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refers both to sex and on the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and won't fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner lamented in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historical terms is a demended and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join factions, which are also absorbed by cultural appropriation of our customs and customs, to advance her egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer attempt to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them continue to keep silent on the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to instruct them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to differentiate themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which has been called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, so stubbornly that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana vaginas: Reclaiming Boss (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) says that we can also defend rooms in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which the black woman is."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and on account of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can thrive in an environment in which my life neither passed, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again, Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a particular concern through the Kurdistan area in Iraq. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," "said Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dust combs, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the Non-Governmental Organization of Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance, which is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was filmed and edited for ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary film maker and multimedia journalist, based in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work is on traced, little noteworthy subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with whose help suppressed churches can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weilicheinefraubin) which reports on violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her spouse, who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put on the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman named Balbuena for abuse, the accurate advertisement of Ada Báez was not useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women give ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women are admitted to be victims of violence at all in the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"Paraguays Law: good approach, faulty implementation beats and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myyr González, a researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 advertisements were filed for domestic violence in the District Attorney Office. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, few of these crimes are actually shown."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on any woman who refuses ad because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this come to the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot properly document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"alone until August 2016, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were killed by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning, she didn't want to do it, but then she had to go. this should repay her forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years, she carried the psychic power on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too submissive, because they are fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the mistreatment of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming a name, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their posts, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of ill-treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen so long ago by Carlos and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse would have at least some complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mistreated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the network Yo te creo (" I believe you "), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"after all, her affluent partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads in the authorities stayed with no result and also from their relatives, they received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a process against her former partner, who developed into an unmanageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it mainly focused on money, power and the influence of their former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay's laws: good approach and lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echuri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porelas (# fürst)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the Movement # NiunaMenos are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law proposes that femicides to explain to an independent criminal record and to punish tougher as it is in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the legislative text was altered in some respects to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay, will be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill had envisaged the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which must bear the victims of violence at the present time, if they simply reimburse and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echofri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer seen as something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who keep silent in the face of these facts contribute to the fact that the perpetrators are offended.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to give as long ad until ill-treatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the Law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate."</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to re-attack his victim.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"the filing of the words" gender, "" political violence "and" sexual harassment "from parts of the law, however, is considered to be a great setback."</seg>

<seg id="2560">"on 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, a member of the Board of Directors, was invited by the ISS to the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"on 9 August 2016, the ISS exercised the deputy editor-in-chief Yousef Al-Haj, who had acted as editor-in-chief after Al-Maamaris's arrest."</seg>

<seg id="2563">"on 26 September 2016, in front of the Court in Masat, the first trial was held in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri."</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">"both al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of disturbance of public order," "abuse of the Internet" "and" "undermining the prestige of the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty of violation of a violation of public and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines of each 3000 omanic rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to one year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US Dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network for the dissemination of material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">"for Al-Abri, a bail of 5000 omanic rial (13 000 US dollars) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the sentence announced."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"the Appeals Court said to Al-Abri at a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari."</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 following the arrest of his six month prison sentence from the Central Prison in Masat. al-Haj is still in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"despite the decision of the court to leave Azamn again, the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Afghan government."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"on 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an instruction on which the closure of" Azamn "was extended by three months."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"on 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of" Azamn "was extended by three additional months, with which the minister once again objected to the decision of the Court of Appeal to restore the publication of the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently violated the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2577">"further injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers will change world food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outstanding Blue, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work has been limited by its own imagination and the question of how many types of salad it can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crooked leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants, such as grain or carton varieties. due to this trend plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition Morton is still breeding a salad, but it takes longer since his work becomes more difficult by ever increasing constraints."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river there is a boulder lying around which I have to go.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go too far at Salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand up to court, no one can breed a new salad bar, because all features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very cautious and strives to use no material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger and bigger in the USA and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (open source breeders).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman lettuce at the" "glasshouse" "of the station. it is tested on whether plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT arena and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it has been created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, so that plant breeders can be used permanently."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can oblige themselves to be able to freely use the seeds cultivated by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open Source "breeders only allow others who buy their seed to breed it to breed their own varieties, and it does not immediately spy - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the accredited professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, we have control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to it, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the open-source movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants may be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">ISO-8859-9 (Turkish) iso-8859-10 (Latin 6)</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making their seed freely available to others. thus, their action is in contrast to patent seeds and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available genetic pool is based on the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material that is therefore always available without ceasing.</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, has specialised in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are no such estimates for other plants yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that mishly cultivated plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred so that they have specifically desired features - from those through which their taste or colour improves up to such as they thrive in certain environments and prevent threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders decreases by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse forecast by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow as soon as the patent expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not hinder innovations, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait until a patent expires; certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if one has to wait so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders do not have time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us forward, and it is made impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" we do not really create the features themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and OSSI, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" if you breed a variety, you also breed its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monocultures, are needed for their cultivation of mass herbicides, bred in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is exactly opposite." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such, who move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create most of the smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patenting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the opinion that breeders would become more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new and stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue since I know my competitors will sell my varieties for themselves in a few years," he says. "with a patent you have been protected from competition for 20 years with a patent." worldwide response "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is an open source seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to get to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agrecol is working on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding are different from country to country, so the OSSI obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law yet; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend for seed patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for open source seed systems, states that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for the planned launch of the official launch."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups (among them Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and centration) has assembled a database about seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a context, by the Luby of OSSI hopes that soon more people will recognize him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has particularly taken care of where and how something is grown, and seed systems hardly played a role," said Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2725">"the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true, despite this attack and the mocking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are committed to defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored site of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar Network of Al Jazeera for alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how the police pursued physical violence against two students."</seg>

<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the fact that blogs are very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi. and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a siege, an arrest, an attempted murder, a summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only on a small audience."</seg>

<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities locked up 133 web pages from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>

<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs offer began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering the contents that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the decision-making decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian people have no legal basis with which they can proceed to court against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "thieves smoke chemist with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air coffee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 violence wave in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called for the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"for detailed coverage of violence in Rio, the newspaper" Extra "published on August 16th," This is not normal, "in which she announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the paper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens in Rio is published in the" War in Rio "section. (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a 4 minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, explained that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police that only shoots and then ask questions to cover."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" be used more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist, Cecília Oliveira, argues against the violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"to remember, the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2777">"according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data. "</seg>

<seg id="2780">"the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, is dedicated to the fact that, as Cecília emphasizes, the state security policy has been repeated for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"this security policy also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police station and to permanently stationing a unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"initially, this led to a decrease of violent deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux, from one of his articles from 2010, stated why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"for this, penetration into the territory of a" enemy "in which a civilian is a non-sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" distorted bullets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war back or forth, the fact is that the residents of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2788">"one week ago, the police attacked the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities are suffering from brutal sieges and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victory Watch, a joint initiative by the Peace Organisation PAX and the Research Institute, The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta Region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition come out, on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these areas have been controlled by rebels outside of Damascus under siege, which caused residents to be transported locally or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghouta, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms do not belong to the commonly grown foods in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the Directorate of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because it is possible to plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that for three years he has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now gaining recognition."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform Cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting fungi, so Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used in plastics in order to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" production of fungus seeds from the regions, "before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"after that, they planted a little fungal farm in a tub. when this was done, they used a bigger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the start of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that took place in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this resulted in the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires have also been registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 dead."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bursts spread in the northern and central regions of the country, and about 250 million hectares of forest and many villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, in Pedrógão Grande, a similar tragedy happened, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos, approximately 500,000 acres of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>

<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the government of the farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">They did this Sunday nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy could have happened as in June, as the streets were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"in addition, construction permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had submitted to serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objectionable by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government led a loosening of the law allowing the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means for self-protection, that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," João Sorval continues in the same article of the newspaper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organisation Quercus drew attention to the fact that large areas with eucalyptus trees, trees made of light inflammable wood, are increasingly spreading like in a vicious circle, after fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems are related to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal was seeking information on 15 and 16 October when people sought information, or were trying to contact relatives who were offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they took advantage of their own civil protection data with the help of the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the servers did not stand the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2873">"in one night in the autumn of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban."</seg>
<seg id="2874">"two years before, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, was in the province of Ghazni in Central afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner."</seg>
<seg id="2876">"even though his mother did not say it at that time, she knew that she would not see her son much longer - perhaps never again."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara were suddenly feeling defenceless."</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban known for their hatred on the Hazara-known Taliban were getting closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a few years he worked in a cohroom pit, working hard and sick."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars, who were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was dominated by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service there and no heating. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows to prevent us from freezing at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to aid needy."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a second chance for expired asylum seekers due to relatively high rates of twin rates. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers are in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" special centres of reception, "which involves improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have submitted an application for asylum - which can still withdraw after the registration of asylum seekers for months."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible livelihood helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack-bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now subject to the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to the official estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, some of the Afghan-owned companies emerged, including dressmaking, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the restaurant's menu tells the story of their trip to Italy by the different Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Kabulogna pizzeria in Bologna and a Sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"but Asharafs's goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomic industry and retail, and go back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teenager."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">"I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women."</seg>

<seg id="2925">"Asharaf also greets plans for the opening of a Kabul factory where people can learn about packaging and learning techniques." "so they can sell their harvests on the market and improve their financial situation," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity."</seg>
