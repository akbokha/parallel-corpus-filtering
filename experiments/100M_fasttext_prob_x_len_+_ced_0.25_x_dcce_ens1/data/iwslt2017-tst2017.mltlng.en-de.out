this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before anyone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectacular , that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally sur@@ rendered dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter at all ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined cra@@ cks and called upon him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and to spy journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Review , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked on cra@@ cks , he did something that many brave repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something unusual happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had argued for years that it was essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cra@@ cks . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
&quot; instead of separ@@ ating and cra@@ cks to make statements , that could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his agreement , get his phone messages secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit , and even travel tips with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and ris@@ king supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments together . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government ranks too much from its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology is allowed by the government to handle the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software , which has not yet been written when cra@@ cks had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; this technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source over @-@ source translation system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet of Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , as described here by the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot secre@@ tly proc@@ ure information , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the start . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , however , is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ators like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to get mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; or the next eco @-@ worker who is alert to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street @-@ insi@@ der , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies like Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister res@@ igned .
&quot; in addition , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nervous about the next release , and on the next un@@ covered documents . &quot;
it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
&quot; it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world media and leading politicians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there have been no prominent Americans who occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ ley Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some US states you need less information to provide less information to form a company to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to pick up school@@ children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers are allowed to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African Minister , who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; it really sho@@ cked us that everyone except a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; none of these att@@ or@@ neys took us as clients , and no one was given money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we have to change the rules to complic@@ ate this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very sad , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing could have changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as a native optim@@ ist I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has captured central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders who recognise the problem and advoc@@ ate to end this type of in@@ transparency through laws . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally stop the in@@ transparency which now enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after completing my design studies , I made an outlet store . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed standing and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace scor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake of asking him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
then I heard say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; um , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I slept in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in ? &quot;
a wild stranger sle@@ eps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed , sho@@ ok at ti@@ p@@ tips to the door , and my bedroom door shut down . &quot;
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art which he had bought from me hangs in his classroom today . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers were actually friends , who only waited to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a tim@@ ed , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . &quot;
Ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I &apos;m sure , our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door dropped into the castle , Brian and I stopped . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept out of it .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; no one , who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things that you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Academy of Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of confidence we were striving .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
share your un@@ locked mobile phone with your left hand barn .
this quiet landing of panic that you can sense now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most guests feel so even if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
so who actually has Al Gor@@ es cell phone now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ elling for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name , if he told wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones !
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait for both hosts and guest handed out their ass@@ essments before we placed them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
&quot; not surprisingly , we trust the people most of us who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it &apos;s exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation justi@@ fies com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; you get no answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your home ! I make holidays with my family . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people are using our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , it was unbeliev@@ ably good fortune . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need that had not been met previously . &quot;
for us the business is just very good .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who were un@@ allowed parties celebrated or apartments devast@@ ated .
hosts have let guests be in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was at the foref@@ ront when confidence has been broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one h@@ ears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million medi@@ ated nights had a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other rightly .
&quot; if trust works , miracles can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart inf@@ ar@@ ges due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives even though they don &apos;t really know one .
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of sharing coinci@@ de with monetary transactions ?
this is a commercial transaction .
&quot; but it is now simply called &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if travelling was a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub area , from which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow society and relationships , rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many car parks , which belong to the government , have already begun . &quot;
students who were looking for a place of residence were offered .
&quot; were convey@@ ed to people whose children were educated , inc@@ ub@@ ator programs have been started , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even a host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
&quot; hospitality , too , existed before . &quot;
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find this amazing
almost overwhelming .
every time I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
&quot; we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the check @-@ in at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show that Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met any Muslim , it is great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual muscle . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ te myself .
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only passi@@ vely accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed in question , dou@@ b@@ ted and finally believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to we@@ eping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands you , and yet somehow loves you ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my lap turned into indign@@ ation quickly .
why should one do such a thing ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , &quot; ... &quot; ... Ji@@ had ... , &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me from a citizen to a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move to a new city and start studying . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I went in silence -- as deep as I went in my seat , and I was afraid of being a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard and read the war@@ nings of the national islam@@ ic organizations , who said , &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t blame you . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings came : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the comprehensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were held for Muslims , broke into the open and struck them . &quot;
there were really sur@@ charges to mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have anger@@ ed the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it just raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is incorrect .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are the invent@@ ors and teachers , ear@@ ne@@ ers and Olympi@@ ques . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; it might be a few parking spaces available , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to view people of other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant , and to show larger civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; during the radic@@ alization process , it has been found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts hate the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors its behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or distra@@ cted by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS justi@@ fies its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would fit into their imagination by recognis@@ ing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clause with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when you take a look at them , they are not driving what they read in their &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given meaning to her anger , she was a prime objective of the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formance and pre@@ ju@@ dice . &quot;
&quot; one study shows that if you submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim lands and the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you see when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two elec@@ toral periods .
&quot; Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all . &quot;
&quot; with the assignment of collective responsibility , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; he and his wife Yus@@ on were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was at the Te@@ aching Fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a sealed young man out of my little brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Yus@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had posted comments against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he slept eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed at home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to give to our children : one that would be controlled by fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child seat , we ro@@ de sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; and I took him out , and put off my shoes , and went into the building of prayer , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m gave an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had the courage and sympathy of panic and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who think you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , work in a noble mind@@ set , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did so with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , in any way , I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about getting a billion dollar business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ par@@ cel service penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting them , planes reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ reli@@ ant structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space and determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e. g. &quot; Start &quot; and &quot; End . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flying gad@@ get that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in reverse flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has large benefits when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind turbines .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft does no matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
posts : 5@@ 204
&quot; during our research , we often face basic abstract questions which advance at the heart of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known for example as machines with a thousand moving parts that get together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ d@@ der . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying is working with just one . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ operated aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it only has a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechanical simple , it happens very much in the interior , so that it can fly stable , and move in the room everywhere . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right correctly . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ eli@@ hood of throwing it right right when I see all is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in car@@ eless@@ ness , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; in this way , he receives the extraordinary ability to &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it rot@@ ates or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be imagined in models , the rest is directly learned during flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see it .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two prop@@ eller flying machines .
this turns in clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , even if limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration will examine synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we accepted standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where space it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine da dr@@ ills wants to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the salary is in development and creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy ; they transformed the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second . &quot;
this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a giant laser detector from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to search gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognised her as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Lig@@ o Det@@ ector : the Laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final trial to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after commissioning the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes ro@@ ut through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my father &apos;s daughter .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has investigated gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of black holes and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o for 23 years . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a spra@@ ying in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and cast into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative , instruc@@ tors in courses lead to rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ amped upon meeting the waves . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about grav@@ itation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne has published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
with tones this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now just talks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob suspen@@ ds her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot create simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we transform wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; listening to the grav@@ itation can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; message : Hello , I was looking at rock @-@ gear.de today and found something that might be interesting for you . &quot;

&quot; it is a kind of movement set , em@@ bos@@ sed into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- I heard this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn about as fast as the bars of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est bodies in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle around one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
in this there is the remaining significance of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe , as it had never been possible before . &quot;
on this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
much in space we can not see -- virtually or basically -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them from them .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own shining light . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of whom we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars producing black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancest@@ ral bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the sau@@ rian no@@ od@@ les for our arch@@ eological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o enables us to completely different perspectives on the events in space , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ a@@ geous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; for one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to hold speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , on an unexpected way . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an ast@@ o@@ unding side effect : only recently I fully understood that &quot; yes &quot; to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things get out of it and awake you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in a great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for adding 70 hours of program to the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days of four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars , television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which simultaneously in production are : 24 episodes : &quot; &quot; horror , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running one another on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I have created myself , and not only produced , so even overhead . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who else does it ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I say it to you , that all of you who work so hard if you now run a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a household , take me seriously when I say : I understand that it is not going to dream at a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , everything blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I go deeper into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
&quot; as if you wear a high tone , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the tot@@ als . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could forever drive on it . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I declare to them the sum that I am talking about writing , that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; do you not understand me wrong , that does it . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I began to work and to work and work , build , create , and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the tot@@ als are action and activity . the tot@@ als are a drug .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ ming , then you cannot strive for size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than aiming for great@@ ness , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I &apos;m not for failure , and I only know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more I am writing history . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als . &quot;
I like this sum@@ ming . I love the tot@@ als .
I need the tot@@ als . I am the tot@@ als .
am I only this sum@@ ming ?
and then the tot@@ als stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ stressed , over@@ driven , burned out . &quot;
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are accu@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that her m@@ um is a single working title .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; My mother will not be there , but you can write to my wife . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says , &quot; Bi@@ bs , I want to go to the Sh@@ onda country . &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are a baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the tot@@ als ceased . &quot;
the h@@ um of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .

&quot; I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 @-@ hour days , continuous weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium is not asleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ ming .
in me there was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a showcase Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the tot@@ als and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; Cho@@ ose you , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do what you are doing , you love what you are doing , a ban@@ ker to be a mother , a painter , to be a mother , a painter , to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to stop sum@@ ming when the bu@@ zz stops , who &apos;s you ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; south @-@ state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; pussy . &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; bi@@ b . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m playing Titan and my tot@@ als , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , I cannot do anything except adap@@ ting . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is going to be released , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; lets loose . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity is .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that doesn &apos;t immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums come back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the tot@@ als , but a tot@@ als . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
&quot; no magic , no secret . only love . &quot;
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the tot@@ als , the working sums , the Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ um , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and television sessions and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the tot@@ als are no strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the stream coming from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz@@ ing is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a fixed rule , so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ a@@ holic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
I don &apos;t like to play as much as I work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer at work than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , for what kind of person prefer to be a home ? &quot;
&quot; OK , now I just want BF@@ 1918 / 2 . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we r@@ attle in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always go to my mobile phone .
&quot; OK , now I just want BF@@ 1918 / 2 . &quot;
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ als of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we stop playing with the playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you probably have right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they want to do something else .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
&quot; and talking to my teen@@ age daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more do not need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even at a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my feel @-@ good , my world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
&quot; to &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it yourself .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training , when I wanted to make myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the tot@@ als came back in my spare time . the tot@@ als seem to return when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the tot@@ als , the bu@@ zz is not I ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my tot@@ als .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so grateful . &quot;
it is me s@@ nu@@ ff that I am a titanium . I have never seen a titanium that plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the tot@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ ming , the more this unusual , descri@@ p@@ tive , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more me ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think of things , I awake you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a physician who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; it is certainly one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; &quot; depth @-@ brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ poses an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson disease that suffered under intense trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a the brain will inc@@ ur and the skull stroke increases .
to save life it is necessary to reduce cran@@ ial pressure .
&quot; for this , you sometimes have to remove a part of a s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; letting cells grow from a tissue piece , is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that was exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many experiments Jean @-@ François managed .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can transform into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved different .
they were sharing slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingual area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark color to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we planted them at the reception table of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto @-@ transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
with the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not used , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we did an injury and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were irrit@@ ated .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
can these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
&quot; so , we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task . &quot;
they had to take food p@@ ellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
&quot; when they achieved a stable dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we had the motor skills area in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontane@@ ously recovered to some degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just as with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey who spontane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we spread the cells : the same monkey , two months after plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them with human beings .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting with these great results , you have to fill up about two kilo@@ grams of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multic@@ enter study . &quot;
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile herb it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable awareness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- not the austerity programs that were realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , along with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; because without democracy , our societies are bl@@ ur@@ red , our future is dark and our great , new technologies are wa@@ sted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Twin Summit Par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which thro@@ ws its long shadows over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy business@@ men and corporations , who are too timi@@ d to invest in where it would be productive and income , with which it could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , in all the prosperity of producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tril@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5.1 tril@@ lion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did to infl@@ ame the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in a continuous loop , wor@@ sen@@ ing the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would be true that his son would kill him if he grew up , &quot;
invol@@ un@@ tarily turns the circumstances that cause O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally ended too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing about the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that they were involved in the working arms , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co@@ determination with equal voting in questions of the state of the state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept for a long time --
&quot; like a candle that glo@@ ws very bright , it is also quickly burnt out . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not roots in ancient Athens . &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- was a democratic free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place by gradually in@@ filtr@@ ating politics and depri@@ ving them . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of its DNA .
&quot; it is because you can be in the government today , yet not in power , because the power is stra@@ ined from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which has so long lasting the animals , from which it nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated , that at the end it is star@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ ass@@ ed politics as much as it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are becoming down@@ right , economic demand falls and the managers of corporations are too anxi@@ ous to invest in cash from their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , aside from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation leaves the twin peaks higher , the wa@@ sted effort , and the social conflicts deeper , as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we must transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified sector , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological surveillance @-@ hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he has produced -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to that in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in which machines are used and humans stick their energy into the study of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what does it mean , how could it look like having this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like Utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to mention some examples shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one work@@ station to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income comes from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing , and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no distinction is made between those who are owned by the companies , but who are not working in it , and employees working there that the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating rate of exchange , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that all world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call them &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment materials are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Brett@@ on W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time a liber@@ atory in which it pre@@ fers privileged persons , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not , technological development will produce such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a Liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and so I am completely confused . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not confused , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is played is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to associate liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was very scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can observe in China now resem@@ bles very much the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now , China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself sm@@ ells enormous to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Finance Minister for Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for the first half of the months six months later ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say good @-@ bye to us from compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the constant den@@ ial that a massive rejection of the Eurozone was proce@@ eding and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal to reveal this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have also chosen the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it will be possible for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what are the changes you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a minister of finance , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has no mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed there was an honest interest on the banks of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to fall , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the corruption that passed through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to conc@@ ede that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for five years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ phi@@ es , who imposed this policy on us , arose : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone has not survived . &quot;
&quot; for if it does not survive , the fre@@ est@@ anding staff will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to follow the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most people have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19th , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago .
Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studios
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard cont@@ ested sector . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are located at the right corner of this turn . &quot;
this graph is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; they are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire . &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what goes off at this end of the turn . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is not worried about the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence to supp@@ ress &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about medium de@@ vol@@ ution , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy &apos;s price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch them for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases things for nothing , do you use it right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you jump over or check again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this reads : &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- literally in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a contest , he and his team have looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the ratings they give the shows their course of shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience , which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together they took a risk and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
are you familiar with this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this turn . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; we have two very competitive , data @-@ sealed firms . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is this ?
because logic is somehow saying that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; what you can expect , is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so it &apos;s a bit frigh@@ tening because we are living in a time where we intervene more and more , in order to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no @-@ one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come into contact with it you are in jail .
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a dism@@ iss@@ al occurs . &quot;
&quot; just as with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; average television , 22 minutes , can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is proof that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Google announced that they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worst way -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a big message sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fla@@ w@@ lessly , year around year , until it suddenly stopped working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows into making choices of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should make sure that data is helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very wise men use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
first you disman@@ tle this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a second you put the items together again to make a decision .
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces to be put together again , even if the information is incomplete in order to get a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intel@@ le@@ ct , where they belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , which they would otherwise have not been capable of . but deciding how to take all those parts and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; did not stand in the data . &quot;
&quot; Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision . &quot;
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compet@@ ed for TV ideas , then they chose Alpha House as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say , &quot; &quot; This is what the data tells us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
thank you ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the tool for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ ws or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will f@@ encing it later with a technology demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a much smar@@ ter , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right bend . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
