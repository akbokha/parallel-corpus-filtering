<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular, that the NSA illegally listened to telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally surrendered drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train he became a symbol of the government's pattern, whistleblowers to condemn and to spy journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Review, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked on cracks, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something unusual happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had argued for years that it was essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of separating and cracks to make statements, that could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his agreement, get his phone messages secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit, and even travel tips with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risking supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments together."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government ranks too much from its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional review because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology is allowed by the government to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software, which has not yet been written when cracks had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this technology is SecureDrop, an open source over-source translation system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet of Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, as described here by the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot secretly procure information, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the start."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop, however, is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that jeopardize us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology denominators like Edward Snowden have a chance to get misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next eco-worker who is alert to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street-insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies like Moselle Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"in addition, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervous about the next release, and on the next uncovered documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">It sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Grisham's novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle of which these tax havens work, Mosley Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some US states you need less information to provide less information to form a company to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to pick up schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers are allowed to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator turned out to be an African Minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"it really shocked us that everyone except a lawyer made proposals to our investigator, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these attorneys took us as clients, and no one was given money to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to complicate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very sad, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing could have changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a native optimist I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has captured central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leaders who recognise the problem and advocate to end this type of intransparency through laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally stop the intransparency which now enables this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after completing my design studies, I made an outlet store."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed standing and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake of asking him:" "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "um, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I slept in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I get in?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed, shook at tiptips to the door, and my bedroom door shut down."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art which he had bought from me hangs in his classroom today. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers were actually friends, who only waited to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a timed, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">Creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure, our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door dropped into the castle, Brian and I stopped."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented the investors:" "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still very consolation, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can concentrate on the things that you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Academy of Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of confidence we were striving.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your unlocked mobile phone with your left hand barn.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet landing of panic that you can sense now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel so even if they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">So who actually has Al Gores cell phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is channelling for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name, if he told whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really hold very well unlocked mobile phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to surrender negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait for both hosts and guest handed out their assessments before we placed them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"not surprisingly, we trust the people most of us who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It's exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation justifies commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, such as" "Hi!", "you get no answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, for example," I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request will not be accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" great works of art in your home! I make holidays with my family. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people are using our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, it was unbelievably good fortune."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that had not been met previously."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were unallowed parties celebrated or apartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests be in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was at the forefront when confidence has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million mediated nights had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, miracles can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart infarges due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives even though they don't really know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay expires."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing coincide with monetary transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is a commercial transaction.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now simply called" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling was a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visited, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub area, from which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow society and relationships, rather than loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many car parks, which belong to the government, have already begun."</seg>
<seg id="240">Students who were looking for a place of residence were offered.</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed to people whose children were educated, incubator programs have been started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even a host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"hospitality, too, existed before."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">Every time I have to think about it when a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"we know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the check-in at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show that Americans mean, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met any Muslim, it is great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagull-fitness fanatic</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual muscle."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to oute myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "why do you suppress yourself?" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and finally believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone perceives you fully understands you, and yet somehow loves you?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My lap turned into indignation quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists...,... "in the name of Islam...,"... "... Jihad...,"... "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me from a citizen to a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move to a new city and start studying."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I went in silence -- as deep as I went in my seat, and I was afraid of being a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard and read the warnings of the national islamic organizations, who said," Be watchful, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well-lit areas, "" Don't blame you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings came:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the comprehensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were held for Muslims, broke into the open and struck them."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really surcharges to mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have angered the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually hear people say:" there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="327">"like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are the inventors and teachers, earneers and Olympiques."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it might be a few parking spaces available, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to view people of other faiths more tolerant, and to show larger civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"during the radicalization process, it has been found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists hate the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors its behavior and ideology is a traitor or distracted by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS justifies its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would fit into their imagination by recognising them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clause with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you take a look at them, they are not driving what they read in their" "Holy Scriptures." ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that makes them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given meaning to her anger, she was a prime objective of the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia and my family are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"one study shows that if you submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were rather military attacks on Muslim lands and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you see when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to give to our children: one that would be controlled by fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child seat, we rode silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"and I took him out, and put off my shoes, and went into the building of prayer, and what I saw, left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam gave an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and sympathy of panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about getting a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air-parcel service penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting them, planes reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-reliant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulences and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space and determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level, e. g." Start "and" End. ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying gadget that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in reverse flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can float, and thus has large benefits when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft does no matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>

<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face basic abstract questions which advance at the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known for example as machines with a thousand moving parts that get together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying is working with just one."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-operated aircraft. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it only has a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and crossbars, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanical simple, it happens very much in the interior, so that it can fly stable, and move in the room everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throwing it right right when I see all is small, so I'll show you a video filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in carelessness, this machine is here, the bus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"in this way, he receives the extraordinary ability to"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it rotates or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things can be imagined in models, the rest is directly learned during flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see it.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two propeller flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them, they behave like a high-performance quadcopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further, even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration will examine synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We accepted standard Micro-Quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where space it is and is self-controlled. that's why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine da drills wants to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>

<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>

<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy; they transformed the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit more brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group decided to build a giant laser detector from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to search gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised her as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Ligo Detector: the Laser interferometer- Gravitational-wave Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of Ligo was significantly increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final trial to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, just a few days after commissioning the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes rout through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my father's daughter.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has investigated gravitational-waves of black holes and their observatories like Ligo for 23 years. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a spraying in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and cast into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative, instructors in courses lead to relativity-theory often a really albering dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched and stamped upon meeting the waves. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne has published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just talks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob suspends her." ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot create simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we transform wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"message: Hello, I was looking at rock-gear.de today and found something that might be interesting for you."</seg>
<seg id="524">Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement set, embossed into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- I heard this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn about as fast as the bars of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle around one hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the remaining significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"Ligo paves a whole new way to explore the universe, as it had never been possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can not see -- virtually or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about them from them.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes happen in the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own shining light."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back at the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of whom we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we didn't expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars producing black holes, such as Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancestral bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the saurian noodles for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo enables us to completely different perspectives on the events in space, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for one year I would say to all" "Yes!" "before I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to hold speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"" yes, "changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, on an unexpected way. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an astounding side effect: only recently I fully understood that "yes" to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things get out of it and awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for adding 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days of four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars, television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which simultaneously in production are: 24 episodes:" "horror, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running one another on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts I have created myself, and not only produced, so even overhead. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, that all of you who work so hard if you now run a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a household, take me seriously when I say: I understand that it is not going to dream at a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, everything reality, everything blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I go deeper into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"as if you wear a high tone, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the totals."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could forever drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I declare to them the sum that I am talking about writing, that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"do you not understand me wrong, that does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I began to work and to work and work, build, create, and work together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totals are action and activity. the totals are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzzing is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzzing is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a summing, then you cannot strive for size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than aiming for greatness, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I'm not for failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more I write history, the more I am writing history."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the totals, the totals, the totals."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this summing. I love the totals.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the totals. I am the totals.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this summing?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overstressed, overdriven, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mum is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people," My mother will not be there, but you can write to my wife. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says," Bibs, I want to go to the Shonda country. ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the totals ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The hum of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">Date: 06 / 14 / 2009 Size:</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15-hour days, continuous weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium is not asleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no summing.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me there was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a showcase Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the totals and the buzzing I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," "Choose you, stupid author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do what you are doing, you love what you are doing, a banker to be a mother, a painter, to be a mother, a painter, to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how to stop summing when the buzz stops, who's you?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "south-state waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late, and she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not" pussy. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "bib."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm playing Titan and my totals, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of humming, I cannot do anything except adapting."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is going to be released, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen "lets loose."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity is.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so scarce that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that doesn't immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the totals, but a totals."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">"no magic, no secret. only love."</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the totals, the working sums, the Titanensum, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and television sessions and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The totals are no strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzzing is the stream coming from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzzing is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a fixed rule, so that I can free myself from any debt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't like to play as much as I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, for what kind of person prefer to be a home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"OK, now I just want BF1918 / 2."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rattle in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">"OK, now I just want BF1918 / 2."</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the totals of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we stop playing with the playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you think me naive, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking to my teenage daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more do not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece, even at a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my feel-good, my world."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">"to" "Play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I siege. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training, when I wanted to make myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The totals came back in my spare time. the totals seem to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the totals, the buzz is not I... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my totals.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of work is part of me, but just a part. and for that I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me snuff that I am a titanium. I have never seen a titanium that plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the totals."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this summing, the more this unusual, descriptive, naked and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more me!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am a writer. I think of things, I awake you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"" "do you want to play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to deal with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A physician who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"it is certainly one of the most well-known, the" "depth-brain stimulation". "in doing so, one imposes an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson disease that suffered under intense trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with a skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that in skull-brain traumata the brain will incur and the skull stroke increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life it is necessary to reduce cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, you sometimes have to remove a part of a swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"letting cells grow from a tissue piece, is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the surroundings to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That was exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many experiments Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are unripe cells, which can transform into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were sharing slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-lingual area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark color to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we planted them at the reception table of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- auto-transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">With the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not used, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we did an injury and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were irritated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dyed in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they achieved a stable dexterity level, we had the motor skills area in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to some degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just as with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we spread the cells: the same monkey, two months after plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them with human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting with these great results, you have to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile herb it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable awareness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy disappears with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- not the austerity programs that were realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, along with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"because without democracy, our societies are blurred, our future is dark and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin Summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which throws its long shadows over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy businessmen and corporations, who are too timid to invest in where it would be productive and income, with which it could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, in all the prosperity of producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did to inflame the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in a continuous loop, worsening the pessimism of investors, which would be true that his son would kill him if he grew up,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily turns the circumstances that cause Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally ended too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive thing about the athenical democracy was and is that they were involved in the working arms, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political codetermination with equal voting in questions of the state of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that glows very bright, it is also quickly burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies have not roots in ancient Athens."</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- was a democratic free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our current democracies since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place by gradually infiltrating politics and depriving them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because you can be in the government today, yet not in power, because the power is strained from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores, which has so long lasting the animals, from which it nourishes, decimated, that at the end it is starved."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has harassed politics as much as it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are becoming downright, economic demand falls and the managers of corporations are too anxious to invest in cash from their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" demos "from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "keep control, as in ancient Athens, aside from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation leaves the twin peaks higher, the wasted effort, and the social conflicts deeper, as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must transform the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunified sector, otherwise we end in a pathological surveillance-hyperautocracy, which makes the film" Matrix "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he has produced --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopie, similar to that in" "Star Trek", "in which machines are used and humans stick their energy into the study of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long discussions the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what does it mean, how could it look like having this" Star Trek "like Utopia rather than the" Matrix "similar Dystopie?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to mention some examples shortly."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one workstation to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income comes from capital and redeeming, and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction is made between those who are owned by the companies, but who are not working in it, and employees working there that the company does not belong to. no exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating rate of exchange, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging markets], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency -- call them" the Cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment materials are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the background of a unified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time a liberatory in which it prefers privileged persons, and Marxian because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not, technological development will produce such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, which Larry Summers describes as a" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, therefore I am a Libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and so I am completely confused."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not confused, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large amount of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is played is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I may say this provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was very sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can observe in China now resembles very much the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now, China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself smells enormous to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Finance Minister for Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for the first half of the months six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say good-bye to us from complacency, and the constant denial that a massive rejection of the Eurozone was proceeding and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal to reveal this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have also chosen the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism, it will be possible for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what are the changes you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a minister of finance, or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has no mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed there was an honest interest on the banks of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government to fall, just because they didn't want to deal with the corruption that passed through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for five years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's trophies, who imposed this policy on us, arose:" that was a colossal mistake. "</seg>

<seg id="1038">"most people have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19th, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard contested sector."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are located at the right corner of this turn."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This graph is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"they are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire. ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what goes off at this end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price is not worried about the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence to suppress" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about medium devolution, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy's price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch them for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon releases things for nothing, do you use it right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you jump over or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this reads:" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- literally in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a contest, he and his team have looked at the available data on the Netflix viewers, so the ratings they give the shows their course of shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience, which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together they took a risk and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Are you familiar with this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this turn. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"we have two very competitive, data-sealed firms."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic is somehow saying that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect, is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so it's a bit frightening because we are living in a time where we intervene more and more, in order to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no-one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room. come into contact with it you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a dismissal occurs."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just as with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"average television, 22 minutes, can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is proof that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009 Google announced that they can predict outbreaks of flu, the worst way -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big message sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year around year, until it suddenly stopped working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows into making choices of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should make sure that data is helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very wise men use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">First you dismantle this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the items; as a second you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces to be put together again, even if the information is incomplete in order to get a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and intellect, where they belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, which they would otherwise have not been capable of. but deciding how to take all those parts and make a show like" House of Cards "did not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">"Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision."</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas, then they chose Alpha House as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say," "This is what the data tells us."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Thank you...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the tool for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a jaws or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fencing it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a much smarter, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right bend."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
