Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; a chapel chapel , where it is now dig@@ ged for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
Klein@@ gar@@ dener manages the former land of peasants .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories to days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that had to get excited because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a circum@@ navigation .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but it is therefore very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich which one does not recognize as such .
&quot; in the large picture card , more detailed maps were drawn for towns and villages , so @-@ called original composition sheets . &quot;
these were based on data from the Bavarian sur@@ veying management between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and origin@@ ate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army chief occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Co@@ ali@@ tion War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops arrived with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a nationwide Baden @-@ Württemberg card . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph continued the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot;
the certificate for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
&quot; the comparison of earlier / today is most impressive , for example , the capital of the state . &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ routine , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was annex@@ ed 21 years after the map was created , thus 1877 , as Munich @-@ based district . &quot;
&quot; today , it is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses were concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation &quot; &quot; from which the foundation stone was derived . &quot;
&quot; today , small plots prove no more farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ end@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October test , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete jungle in the 19th century . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district there is not only the street name &quot; &quot; Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; On the Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked up people with ins@@ anity . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich @-@ based district of Ir@@ ren@@ zu &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought to king Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and , for instance , ended the count of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he for@@ bi@@ ds the personnel to use force against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Regional Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; there was room for 280 patients , and later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ene Institute in Haar 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet now on the site of the former Au@@ er institutions .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
&quot; the football field of the TS@@ V München East is located west , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in architectural style by the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &apos;s original construction , which was destroyed during World War II in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main place &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies broke many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big one remained until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marien@@ hof , where these days were the prec@@ urs@@ ors and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
with the slider the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the National Federation for the Promotion of Colour has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks of the State .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents generally occur throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; it says in the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult for people to cap@@ itali@@ ze discrimination , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim at minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , the people . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents like ra@@ cial offen@@ se against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no longer been killed by the state and arrested by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of being a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i Att@@ orney General , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people must be ready to bring che@@ wing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report program , which classi@@ fies the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for residential or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , following immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities ple@@ dge to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further ra@@ cial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
sub@@ project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ ghing @-@ Project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
the CDU Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the right @-@ grab@@ ber courtyard of the Schwen@@ di family , representatives of the fishing village CDU @-@ Orts@@ verband met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ demann first granted insight into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ este . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest Mil@@ k &quot; is for him the alternative marketing track for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste only regional .
&quot; since he is also the BL@@ H@@ V president of Fisch@@ bach , he described the soft aun@@ ching project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the gr@@ ass@@ land area care for a lot of work , a lot must be mach@@ ined with the brush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer although he does not conduct bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader funding . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be drawn up for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate , &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised the mayor . &quot;
&quot; because of the promotion , farmers often stand in criticism &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure surface is 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted via leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers had a total of 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lords it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg provides state support for pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
pre @-@ requ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of a conveyor set marked by the L@@ PR .
&quot; furthermore , the area to be enclosed must not be man@@ age@@ able ( rise above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence for the Fis@@ her@@ bach Fis@@ her@@ ald project 2018 , is currently under construction . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure surface is equivalent to 35 hectares , which is estimated at more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Fir@@ on Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to limit the legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have found him if he had done it .
&quot; but he grab@@ bed their importance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the memorial , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is objec@@ tively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance to the eav@@ es@@ dro@@ pping words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; iling waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a used classical illustration .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American ne@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Laz@@ arus changed the importance of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone , but rather an early Ne@@ oc@@ on that brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it is to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh rep@@ elled here .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative deed of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ bow but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble journeys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge , and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that of course is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cent of a time when only two Scot@@ ts belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; Director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish ath@@ lets was chosen for London 2017 , which starts on Friday . &quot;
black believes that &quot; something special develops in Scotland &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the sc@@ ot@@ tish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team to team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were sc@@ ot@@ tish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in her fifth world champi@@ onships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Schot@@ ten are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; until now , Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will participate in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships when the only other Scot@@ sman was in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be mixed with medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team mates have voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on stage . &quot;
what about my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a World Cup .
&quot; so it is really important to rely on this home support , and to benefit from the fact that we are again at the Olympiasta@@ dion . &quot;
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking cri@@ tically via Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the He@@ aling of voters
the father of our country knew a little bit of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked in the cri@@ tique , sure . &quot;
but he did not put his critics into silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupid , we will be led as sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who must work to be more like Washington . &quot;
&quot; ho@@ gans staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people , expressing their opinion on their official fac@@ ebook page . &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of the beginning of this week .
&quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismis@@ sed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the fifty govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary head of the head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ il@@ fully to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constitu@@ ents and to de@@ bu@@ ke his ha@@ ar@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ person A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments would be nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people , who swing the whi@@ p online . &quot;
the post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; att@@ or@@ neys Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not bot@@ tled , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not like this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are considered by some rather than a so @-@ called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff lab@@ elled as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to sli@@ ce a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in former times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical tapes or to arrest demonstr@@ ators and to silence them . &quot;
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Before ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be that difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable portra@@ yal had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous correspon@@ dents beat his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had an anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; the peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain over@@ came his office , according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organis@@ es 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led to the Arch@@ er@@ field left until the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he established this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he has won the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that really feels very special , &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year , after I had won it . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to his home soil for action . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Golf .
I am happy about the way it went .
&quot; the trio in the field are the former Masters @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior High Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Drum@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer by passive smoking
&quot; in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases can be attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .

house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ ingen Street are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time &quot; , &quot; said the manager of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which repeatedly hin@@ ders construction work , represents a major problem for the company &apos;s company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists from red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are authorized to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai shel@@ ters in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally referred to as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ coal mine will be extracted and swal@@ lowed with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , Z. B. dresses with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course it can be dangerous late to work : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , turned swi@@ f@@ tly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which enter@@ tains control of the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it o@@ ede@@ . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive to the car .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses that are surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and of cor@@ rug@@ ated plates which have been converted into different yel@@ lo@@ wish tones by r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no for@@ eigner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ ua named a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high @-@ country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has reduced the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has timber resources valued at $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preser@@ ves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal peoples in the 1970 @-@ s have been genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police held more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Are W@@ ishing Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; is said in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from the year 2016 , as reports of atro@@ cities committed in the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric shock are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal supp@@ ression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
bolts have intensi@@ fied since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants are from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up with them .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old P@@ ani@@ ai Local that moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Pap@@ ua , the mo@@ m @-@ m@@ ama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua , their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ho@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann ruled 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed and today the locals are feeling che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ho@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , only two months after Jok@@ ho@@ is &apos;s initi@@ ation , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered a low point in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took offen@@ se in their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and killed the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set alight and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command@@ o centre in order to challenge justice . &quot;
they carried out cerem@@ onial h@@ ears and led the Wa@@ ita dance - continuously and im@@ i@@ ti@@ zing a bird song - from Pap@@ ua &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag peb@@ bles on police and military items .
&quot; when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official document by TIME , which was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was able to listen to the atmosphere .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said in TIME on the por@@ ch of his colourful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin was the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes says , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TIME in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings were fil@@ tered only the following day after Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ho@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura where he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October , 2016 , Minister of Defence , Wir@@ anto said that he should establish a court @-@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical violations of human rights . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke with TIME on June 5th in Jak@@ arta , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it was said that 11 cases of violations of human rights in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the P@@ ani@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims met such alle@@ g@@ ations with fi@@ erc@@ ely un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police ra@@ ced on vill@@ agers in the village of P@@ ani@@ ais and Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital died a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ g who was dro@@ wned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones to officers who responded by fir@@ ing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured are quickly delivered here , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an in@@ firm for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by inv@@ ading spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from P@@ ani@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken in custody in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten village . &quot; &quot;
poverty rein@@ forces dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , each of which can work four or five fields of sweet potato . &quot;
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a ta@@ sted only 10.000 Indonesian Rup@@ iah ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants , who have been in greater numbers since the inaugur@@ ation of new routes to Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
&quot; Pap@@ ua rarely have capital , or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the master council of P@@ ani@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far away from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were depor@@ ted for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ho@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development failed . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ even east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations , and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also attended the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say they are unlikely to vote for Jok@@ ho@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ho@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice to Jok@@ ho@@ i as a &quot; blame &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the bodies of a victim was buried on a site just across the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never be given justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residen@@ ces in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years that one acci@@ dentally calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ ams of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; &quot; told an inhabit@@ ant who called his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire @-@ fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch Building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from covering , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winning positions , which is thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; these often very long , but even so much valued five @-@ set classics are preserved to the traditional competi@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the applications .
&quot; not only at the vote , after many claims , the proposal has already come to the finale at a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 is only compar@@ atively smaller details : in future , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the first round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organisers , the requirements placed in terms of training sets etc. will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to take less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 passengers brings forbidden objects to the aircraft , finds out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent were consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while wearing acci@@ dentally banned kni@@ ves or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed that they had been late discovered that they were mistaken with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted with more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also realized that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents who admitted they have kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were . &quot;
the most common items which were visi@@ bly passed by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
&quot; more than 3 per cent reported to have kno@@ w@@ ingly worn articles with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of male respon@@ dents confirmed that they had inten@@ tionally brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was asking travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dental sm@@ ug@@ gling goods had brought through the airport security , and how many would have been inten@@ tionally done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gled - kno@@ w@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - carry out safety , those who fly most often . &quot;
&quot; however , the company suggests that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often in@@ secure which liquids can take them with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items that are conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for some time , people thought T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;
fluids are permitted on inland flights but not on international flights .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys with the huge number of pre@@ positions for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so far , he has been suggest@@ ing that a part of the customers has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic outlet points , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k will reveal another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure for the first time in the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly record : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery is just starting . &quot;
&quot; eu@@ c @-@ j@@ p ( Japanese , Unix ) shift _ j@@ is ( Japanese , Win / Mac ) iso @-@ 2022 @-@ j@@ p ( Japanese , email ) &quot;
critics always pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; for cancell@@ ations , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 USD and in the UK 1000 Po@@ und ) &quot; Booking &apos; Payment . &quot;
&quot; at present , 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations en@@ vis@@ aged , said Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge in ambitious growth goals is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be assembled - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are available per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today should expect the delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never in practice tested production roads with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to larger delays , then the in@@ solven@@ cy of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
because then the company cannot prevent un@@ cont@@ ented customers from dro@@ pping in dro@@ ves .
EPA &apos;s boss P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ treats the Obama @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s rules to reduce emissions because of the failure of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a
&quot; one day after being accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities in response to re@@ acting than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit that was raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a period of time running on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground @-@ level O@@ zone .
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ eck announced that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a for a long time , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block or delay regul@@ ating , which contra@@ di@@ cts the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itment regulation roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ eck suggested that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to co @-@ operate with states through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ lment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often failed to meet the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to be accused of milit@@ ant groups and others , and agreed on the deadline for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;

&quot; however , the EPA &apos;s opinion that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; power to delay and all other legally available full @-@ made powers &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the Jubil@@ ee of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery are@@ al in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday 16th July at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village made the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens to their concern .
Walter Martini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württ@@ ember@@ gische Ur@@ cust@@ ard : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the document , on the Mount Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church there was also a glorious courtyard , to which the church or patron of the patron belonged and not vice versa . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ elled Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , along with the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the area of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; Berg &quot; &quot; of the third , the ancient settlement nucle@@ us of the village . &quot;
old maps from the period around 1600 are subject to this historical situation .
the right to pat@@ ron@@ ate arose from the early medieval original church right .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied himself with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this self @-@ church . &quot;
this was linked to the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the elder of the two were crushed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell then sounded in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were in@@ filtr@@ ated and the bell panels were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were station@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius Gra@@ vey@@ ard served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was canc@@ eled .
only the tower @-@ tower was left .
&quot; in the New Year of New Year in 18@@ 34 , a storm broke the steep@@ le and half crashed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was dem@@ ol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower @-@ tower existing today remained as a witness to the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em care about the &quot; &quot; creative pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; &quot; as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius facility . &quot;
&quot; the organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with speeches by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk is taking place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers highlight the fantastic view . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of significance for tum@@ ors and hear@@ ths . &quot;
&quot; the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini re@@ affir@@ med . &quot;
association wants to prove permission of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim ad@@ ores &quot; &quot; is not a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ ates &quot; has promp@@ ted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen a wind force concentration zone existed only at the bor@@ der@@ line to Schwal@@ m@@ tal .
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible , at the same time , the concentration zone creates an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , a few days ago , but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a form fault . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval letter is still un@@ lawful and therefore res@@ um@@ ed , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : in front of the summer break , the City Council has again decided to leave the wind@@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; the respective letters have been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them on the occasion to check the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself as regards the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four per 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen particip@@ ates indirectly , had closed lease agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be met - this is roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sens Stad@@ ler gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ nich near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was killed in a le@@ thal way .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; after police officers , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ nich set the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion to her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ aer and people from the region will discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the shopping stroll in the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the business association Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ tise the customers , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket stock . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their apprentic@@ eship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite you to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action is not limited to residents of the city and the region .
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the weekend weekend , so Christian King . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association collaborate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; in this way , the commercial club and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive City . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ sto@@ wed Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potenti@@ als should be newly or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many n@@ atives also lost the inner city of shopping from the view .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly broad@@ ened , König said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his purchasing behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction work , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new more people were injured .
&quot; at a gas explosion in the US city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine more wounded , some of them heavy . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed in the explosion .
a first missing was later also buried dead .
at the dead they were cler@@ ks of the school .
&quot; as a matter of fact , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; during the holiday period , only a few people stayed in the building of the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy . &quot;
Tr@@ ump continued under pressure after deduc@@ ed tran@@ scrip@@ tions of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say he would not pay for a planned boundary wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president accused him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull has also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States immig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US . &quot;
Mr Tr@@ ump ended the call after having said Mr Turn@@ bull . &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for all day .
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury ran through a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man of middle aged in a con@@ i@@ fer strip - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and glan@@ ced around the wind@@ shield .
in@@ ward the in@@ mates were in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man scre@@ wed . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged down by the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a follow @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop around the neck is thrown out of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of them in the audience ble@@ w very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , civil rights to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to mim@@ ic the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey have been le@@ ashed by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years , no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our churches , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps the organization of post@@ ures . &quot;
it is a dirt spot on a story but it is a burden for our souls .
bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life long civil law .
&quot; for him , the post @-@ ordination serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that a wron@@ g@@ ly has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a medi@@ ator will put a blank@@ et on the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI acts received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding areas were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one ever was charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black people in Georgia for the first time to vote their vote in the pres@@ election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com gave a white ground owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore not came from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
&quot; but when they removed from prison and approached Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , removed evidence and accused the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an elec@@ toral massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual post of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; her presentation is vivid , gri@@ pping and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many would like to believe that in America it no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that it is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confronted with its ug@@ ly in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done through . &quot;
&quot; rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the Rest were pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him angr@@ ily that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n ...... he , wa@@ ver@@ ing from my property ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ cona answered the fire . &quot;
there is a pause .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always smiling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compani@@ onship replaces dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene is beginning again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition is violent and fast .
&quot; there are cri@@ es , shots , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a trau@@ ma , stands over the bodies of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays sad song &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as , almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks carries her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; when the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken by their heads , record the f@@ aked blood and the quiet bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch rope and wi@@ pe away their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ ts Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his te@@ amm@@ ates and then breaks in her arms crying together ; the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sat together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at one table a white couple from Atlanta was talking with a black pair , which they just got to know . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words that felt the performance left .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone &apos;s Court holds Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the citizen &apos;s rights . &quot;
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is in a way inspiring , as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;

&quot; Pear@@ son shor@@ tens more 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tens the dividend in order to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut out more 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; the reduction in jobs , which was mainly announced by General Director John Fall@@ on for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 jobs . &quot;
&quot; in May in a third cost reduction program , Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 39@@ 4 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the quick step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner of Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after generating a growth of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;

&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were viol@@ ated , shared a declaration of NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in a Nato position , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening has happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; carried out &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive attachment . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on Bag@@ ram &apos;s Air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on 31 May a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious safety situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump considers the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country . &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide rate in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ex@@ chan@@ ts Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Ru@@ le to K@@ lagen
&quot; the US Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that states are obliged to cur@@ b smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states accused the Agency on account of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Requirements 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said that it is showing the Agency &apos;s obligation to work with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ eck announced the intention of EPA to assess the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions have to be measured in a part of the country to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a suit on Tuesday and said the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump is supposed to boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and nature groups , which concern concerns about the effects of major emissions on public health . &quot;
the EPA website says that breathing air that contains o@@ zone contains &quot; reduce the lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .

&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two contra@@ sts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ tz@@ els decides to set up a community space in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining land part is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; while the area is still owned by the parish community , there is no planning permission for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion with regard to a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
&quot; the administration and majority of the common council bu@@ ys such a community space not as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ent living , but open to the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Salon &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn , is determined by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposal is to indicate the investor to indicate that in this respect there is no b@@ ill@@ ity between the legs , the as@@ certain@@ ment that both saddle @-@ height and the ceiling height - which reduces the height of the tr@@ uss and make the building more economical - it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only is Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he will pass the committee . &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of his own buildings , with which they are not really moving forward , but they rest now in the common room out of the window , they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m heavy with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is strictly speaking to the common room - but absolutely against a communal involvement .
it sees behind it a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy to any wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the area , there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real , in doubt market@@ able counter@@ value , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ wis@@ er &apos;s request to ple@@ ad the decision accordingly , will find three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this is what Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises in the original program that sum@@ mar@@ ises Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; if we sum@@ mar@@ ise the decision , we make a giant leap forward to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road

&quot; as the police reported , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Langen@@ felder was on the way along the Rad@@ weg path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg to Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .

seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the winner of the cup .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30 PM / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel of the German So@@ ccer @-@ Record Master in Bavaria are getting bigger and bigger in the winner of Po@@ kal@@ sieger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to ren@@ ounce on David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; there is also a lack of Manuel Neuer , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six trials , An@@ cel@@ otti held responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the play of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , that was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official pr@@ el@@ ude of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to be intelligent , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who was expecting a &quot; difficult , intensive game . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German football league ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday . &quot;
in the Harz Mountains hike to Stern
&quot; in the Harz , the first &quot; star path &quot; is to be created . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
a planet path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; accommod@@ ates the needs of many Har@@ z@@ visitors .
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic achievement . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase to 2018 , the organisation plans &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; dear readers , as these audi@@ ob@@ ooks are in German , it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language . &quot;
the information on boards should be supple@@ mented by the internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing the location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criteri@@ on .
later the train to train will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of knowledge worth knowing about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star more light than another , even though it was considerably further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation you can find a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the municipality of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there have been something similar to the planned stell@@ ar journey since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet route with its stel@@ a@@ es up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; site at Di@@ em@@ arden ( Community Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the P@@ lu@@ to d@@ warf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , while the sun is at least 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet route is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light is needed from sun to P@@ lu@@ to for about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the stal@@ k with P@@ lu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fixed star would take a half year .
&quot; Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko met for the first time , discussing a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting battle in the near future under 147 Po@@ unds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light weight Champion , went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko to greet the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super Spring Champion Stal@@ lion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How is it you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia rec@@ alled . &quot;
&quot; I asc@@ ended for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 Po@@ und &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down on lightweight .
and he must move on weight @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 Po@@ und debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight championship battle on 23rd September . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said and then openly expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous comb@@ at@@ ant , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three combat champion from River@@ side is &quot; &quot; very slow &quot; , &quot; sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show pot@@ ency , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said that they could feel the momentum , which arose for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;

&quot; during the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed towards the north for about an hour , afterwards traffic could be passed on the left lane at the accident site . &quot;
do you want to report this message ?
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; with the first win of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result also , there were not the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to pay better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three @-@ chain is to be further optimised .
&quot; and a fool according to a free impulse , the For@@ tun@@ en no longer want to catch up . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( ensing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better even after the experience in preparing with the tri@@ p@@ ette than with the qu@@ ad chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer cemetery spar@@ kle , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just been able to build on the half @-@ position in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ elmann , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we do harmon@@ ize even better and we don &apos;t have so many mistakes in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk about a deci@@ de@@ dly successful start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be ok , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can focus on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing to know about this .
&quot; the start of the season I judged only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Wireless , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken pre@@ matur@@ ely due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can virtually start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favor@@ ites in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the defender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; in fact , guests from the Rhin@@ eland are a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stupid , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to start from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant .
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results published by Swedish asylum seek@@ ers &apos; tests
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Food Safety Authority ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started carrying out tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should make an assessment of age more precisely after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; up to now , migration covers 6,@@ 8@@ 80 reported cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson on the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said of the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about its age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the subjects were 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 results , it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it was 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I shots of knee joints , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist , Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people , to see if they were sooner or later than usually passed through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
to assess biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson , by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of jud@@ ging a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven ton of heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s running great , &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , head of the department at the department of road and traffic in the government pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three renov@@ ations in need between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the building is planned for October , and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is respected . &quot;
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red colour@@ ing@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has since come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ developed . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has received a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap . &quot;
&quot; this is a wall fix@@ ation , which is also used as a work@@ piece . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , a 20 @-@ meter wide bridge cap should be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will take place .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling required the laying of pi@@ pel@@ ines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a fibre optic cable , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ lers about the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cr@@ abs must first be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting branch in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is controlled by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for building work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
the cost of the three bridge renov@@ ations is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colourful protest with German potato salad
&quot; it doesn &apos;t seem so often that parties attract an urge , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is difficult to get under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties involved in the Cre@@ ole parliament ( CDU , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows peac@@ efully flag on that day because the Af@@ D invites you to the &quot; &quot; big campaign &quot; &quot; in Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer &apos;s Stadthalle . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ collectors but demonstrate . &quot;
the theme &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at one table &quot; on the fountain , but now takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ale - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , president of the forum One World and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; ur@@ german potato salad &quot; , &quot; which also the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him with him . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel . he took care of such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; now that Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , among them the Rhine @-@ Palat@@ inate Af@@ D leader Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; there are around 200 listeners in the hall that are waiting for the candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chair@@ person Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence was unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is short after 9@@ pm . &quot;
the police can come back - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a good@@ bye with the Wol@@ ver@@ er tromb@@ onist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , in the row Has@@ la@@ cher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; in conjunction with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he is playing a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore , &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and lau@@ re@@ ates of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the acclaimed Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo trumpet of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both un@@ ites the desire to not only cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also merge the boundaries of different genres . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new robe , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ä@@ gers Nils W@@ ogram , mix classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating complete artwork . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer Nils W@@ ogram has written it specifically for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stewart quite openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite in grilled cheese , I think , &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
Hollywood star &apos;s probably best known relationship was Robert P@@ att@@ inson on her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson .
&quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette performer is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I had ever had . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so I never confused or hin@@ dered me .
I just never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in school time they prefer to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt ass@@ aul@@ ted , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be relative in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some describe me as ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you a lot of prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it is time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not appro@@ ve the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
&quot; justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Govern@@ ors Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working on to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , Gover@@ nor Justice &apos;s announcement is just the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom , and is unable to find a positive , unanim@@ ous message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised him on Thursday what he described as an apparent excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be res@@ um@@ ed again in the sport . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ h said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships , that the exile of his country was correct out of the sport and that he decided to fight dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were cut away gold and silver medals at competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress approved for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) reported on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e reports . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself , that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the Task Force recommendations that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships that begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re@@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still active , he told repor@@ ters in London after a talk at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
memorial for soldiers stri@@ pped in Mali
&quot; at a fun@@ eral service in the Northern H@@ essi@@ an F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers were thought of a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
IPN BU 0@@ 193 / 10@@ 72 D@@ WOR@@ CZ@@ Y@@ Ń@@ SK@@ I WI@@ ES@@ Ł .
&quot; she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; cro@@ wning of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life a week ago in the West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ es Dom St. Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church were f@@ arewell . &quot;
&quot; after that , the fun@@ eral service started in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; Trau@@ erg@@ ä@@ ste settled down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm around the coff@@ ins . &quot;
before the church F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ es and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
Minister of Defence of the Ley@@ en described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sm@@ ashed .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the air operation of the fighter pilot tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ chs , commander of the regim@@ ent , to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; at the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en did not show that the deployment was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is of great importance &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the fun@@ eral service , the coff@@ ins were taken from the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this was announced by the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
&quot; the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , it was further stated in the announcement . &quot;
&quot; if Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be un@@ clear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a H@@ ehl from it that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he retired , giving the title &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by explained , the chief speaker of the Danish king . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; born in Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ racy , Mar@@ gre@@ the had met in London in 1965 . &quot;
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always hel@@ pless , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his 50@@ th birthday with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was gay , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked in place of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Minister @-@ President Wei@@ l wants rapid change in new elections
CDU and F@@ DP before the possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a swi@@ ft re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
he said on Friday for the resolution of the parliament .
&quot; prior to that , the surprising res@@ ign@@ ation of a Gre@@ ens @-@ led Parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition of CDU and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover . &quot;

&quot; with this , CDU and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 Se@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new parliament will be elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it imper@@ ative that the Diet resol@@ ves as soon as possible his self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CDU faction is expected to decide on its further course on Tuesday .
the state constitution also provides the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament cho@@ oses the trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be checked in a legally clean way , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed if they are legally reasonably tested . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west &apos;s step &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a practitioner of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the dismis@@ sed dep@@ u@@ ties for the return of their country meeting .
&quot; of course , we assume that she has received her Land@@ tag report , which she has received via the Green Country List , with immediate effect , &quot; shared the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ ill said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen exceed@@ ingly . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to lead a pron@@ unciation in the group .
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;

&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed parts , Herr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) speaks with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; eu@@ c @-@ k@@ r ( Korean ) g@@ b@@ 23@@ 12 ( Chinese , simplified ) g@@ b@@ 180@@ 30 ( Chinese , simplified ) &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all , what we are currently aware of , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has opened up without delay and since the announcement of the concerns of Germany in close cooperation with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as much concern as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and health @-@ harmless .
&quot; if the level of resi@@ due is exceeded by 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are non @-@ market@@ able . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the factories are to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to current knowledge , the production plants do not meet any immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , it must be due to potentially illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too few controllers in the harvest . &quot;
is it lacking only on the staff or also in the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out at 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are available are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have made it clear several times that I expect a comprehensive explanation by the responsible authorities .
does the regular alarm mean for food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly regarded . &quot;
&quot; through the counter@@ f@@ eit means manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in keeping food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be solved quickly and without gaps .
how the football rules of football impact on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded spending on European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation super@@ vis@@ ing the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
financial Fair @-@ Play rules set up in 2011 by UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to extract Brazilian from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make the money loose with security so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar will sign and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the wealthy family of Qatar .
&quot; clubs may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but they must be counter@@ acting with legitimate income sources which enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their business . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken huge debts in their quest for success , che@@ at effectively and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentr@@ ating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally purchased in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to build the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini fell from the pres@@ idency of the presidential election in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are off from excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause from Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sum total for the next five years will be reported amoun@@ ting to EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 made the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of EUR 60 million ( back then 82 million dollars ) , which later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ board their financial view by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come about payments from the 2022 World Cup Organ@@ izing Committee in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Q@@ at@@ ari 2022 are argu@@ ing that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM will be ambassador and can easily find such maneu@@ vers for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
&quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , try to avoid any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G anticip@@ ates that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s removal by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga with a state funded by a club . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because there are different ways or different interests , if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ supplier
in the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board cho@@ col@@ ates for Swiss made .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline writes the contract new .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday on request from the news agency .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
about 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate panels up to 14 grams each year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide information on the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; North @-@ Western Switzerland , &quot; 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros subsidiary achiev@@ es an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; but more important is the advertising effect : for a jack@@ pot manufacturer , it is a prestigious order . &quot;
the Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are involved in the new ten@@ dering .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for an opinion . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Swiss company has been distribut@@ ing chocolate panels on board of its flights . &quot;
&quot; before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablet in cooperation with Hu@@ g . &quot;

nostal@@ gia enters &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ years @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter turned the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to major things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like time is scar@@ ce . &quot;
first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained a original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
&quot; by sti@@ ff@@ ening to the core of the g@@ ags - actors in middle aged play cool kids who will grow up - nevertheless , they have the im@@ possibility to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with its adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally u@@ pro@@ oted and his par@@ ody goes beyond the wat@@ ering principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90@@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character encounters a character by an Apple power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now novel@@ ist , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy evil plot , included in the Ronald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ known impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt Dill@@ ons sub@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of acci@@ dental ma@@ dness that could provo@@ ke this fran@@ chise , like a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I see as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon now re@@ members another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ on@@ de &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with its east @-@ west rally icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest who are fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ tuned Gregor and an ide@@ alist I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose dialog@@ ues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a full producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on television as Americans may do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Find the voice &apos; . &quot;
but Com@@ rade Det@@ ective is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
&quot; in six long episodes , it pul@@ ls itself and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was edited on a lower length , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who swal@@ low a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make everything to feed for a schol@@ ar .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger story and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a strike against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar County , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 accused persons were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 , and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , officials ordered larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
two people were arrested at the same time in Italy at the same time .
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia organized drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organized drug trade in the south German region . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; for this reason , the large bet on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four police officers from Palermo . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up early in the morning , could go to the bank account . &quot;
ways lam@@ ents large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; data of citizens who should not appear there : &quot; &quot; according to a report , the for@@ eigner &apos;s Register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions on asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country register . &quot;
&quot; in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , defici@@ encies in the registered data could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions , warned in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; is present . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , 10 million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; since the data has not been properly maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 have been found in single cases , &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive or of citizens who have become German citizens and in the register no longer should emerge . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data input can slow down back@@ tracking processes , &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of paid @-@ out people , EU citizens are also included who would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; these false statements , however , led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with it , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government apparently began to send refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they came from there . &quot;
&quot; this emerg@@ es from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; &quot; New Osnab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the paper therefore calls for BA@@ MF to carry out such procedures &quot; regarding families with children , with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper insi@@ sted on the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees that they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can return it to the country . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the office is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with poor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) holds these commitments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the female political spokes@@ woman of the Left faction in the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ p@@ ke critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten the un@@ lawful detention conditions in the Italian asylum system due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 litres of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available for other people . &quot;
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , who were honoured on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ow@@ l , who has now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 don@@ ations in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the community in the meeting of the municipal council ackno@@ wle@@ dges the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is brilliant how our bodies are laid out for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors , who provide their blood for strangers , nor un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; emphas@@ ised mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Regional Director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ en@@ bacher , because the preser@@ ves are broken into their components . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ en@@ bacher reports about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Head . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has resulted in higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ lau@@ rel were among the multiple don@@ keys and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many do Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pl@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter delivered 10 times each 500 milli@@ liter of her life juice . &quot;
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over a rise .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
&quot; the decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates at 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month , as the weak economic growth weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly infl@@ ation@@ ary report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and forecast to 1.6 % for 2018 , and warned that inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot;
but it sign@@ aled that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mam@@ mot@@ h economic package , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for financial plan to provide cheaper financial means for banks from the coming February , although it is said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with CHF 115 billion . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forec@@ asting of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , since the pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot;
&quot; the interest rates repeated , however , that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; extent than markets . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; step @-@ by @-@ step &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the down@@ ward corrected growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % , and 1.7 % forecast in May . &quot;
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these news compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision for no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on a interest rate , and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to fall at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent infl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and low levels of sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening is still worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy could not &quot; prevent in@@ comes from in@@ comes &quot; in the coming years , but she added that wages will recover at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which is compens@@ ated by a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU referendum that caused the fall of the P@@ act .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to complete the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the Bank &apos;s last ruling on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households with three policy makers in July called for an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that the exceeding in proportion to its goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent swa@@ p rate of swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are exp@@ iring and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;

patients will receive an &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial , after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October 2018 , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ p pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come into question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a primary doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local sex hospital .
the program is awarded £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchase .
&quot; the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as is widely used , recorded and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when targeted on vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been pro@@ cured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Sh@@ adows @-@ Health Minister said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV infected , and that it will help to end the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne does not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown to me in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely refurb@@ ished . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with an ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and an mezzanine level to make the generous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; to this end , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ l@@ apping , so the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand . &quot;
fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other , without having to mos@@ quit@@ os . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to insert the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored golden furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored at both ends to make it work longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units provide space for all the cut@@ lery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is object @-@ important , so that when you push the door very easily slip . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property will be appreciated , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the size of the ground . &quot;
&quot; here , they succeeded in increasing the floor space and at the same time using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing due to good design and increased square met@@ a of a little standard .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a confrontation because of one of Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s biggest real estate empire in the value of more than 500 million dollars .
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 real estates worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co Jeans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail shops . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul , has described as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the corporate estate and Paul about one third . &quot;
a case of justice states that this means that Col@@ in property has $ 316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the ass@@ essments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now fight for control over the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early affir@@ m@@ ative v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk @-@ bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first jewel shop of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says he began his career when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in asser@@ ts that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars in leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , Paul says , &quot; &quot; the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in was very restra@@ ined , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography from the year 2015 , Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to disgu@@ ise me and draw our family name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands . &quot;
&quot; our father had not wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .

Tr@@ um@@ ps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence from the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course . &quot;
here is a piece by Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive employees on his first working day , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he wanted to fix : poor information coming into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame down Tr@@ ump by over@@ seeing his media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Can@@ didate Tr@@ ump was angry about un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he had received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; said the former Elec@@ toral Ac@@ count@@ ant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February . &quot;
&quot; at the time , Politi@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote that &quot; the key to uph@@ old Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
posts : 5@@ 204
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit ever was &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets do not contain any more combus@@ ti@@ bles .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his associates have managed to keep away from it several times , their efforts have paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented g@@ ass@@ le contro@@ vers@@ y .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump Material that potentially promotes their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to give the president for strategic reasons , dou@@ bt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a vul@@ cano to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he tends to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; that was what happened at the end of February , when someone compl@@ ained to the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy commander K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for sh@@ kan@@ es , or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he has sold false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Williams read the article and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tr@@ ump ob@@ tains . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tried to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his couns@@ ell@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will be asked and raised . &quot;
the police all over Europe sends post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; as the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are naturally not known , indications from the population are hoping and asked . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences have shown that many volati@@ le destinations are hiding at holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards for sought criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
&quot; since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times have been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online songs could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of statements after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate about a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the foot of the war , who have negoti@@ ated a tren@@ ch from the community to claim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans in a field outside a prosper@@ ous road by Soli@@ h@@ ull , called the &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s Series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their incur@@ sions . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defensive systems and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers . &quot;
the Council must be forced through shame to implement it as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May and were moved on and are back again .
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instruction to protect its parks . &quot;
I am living on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal taxes if the Council cannot even stop this .
&quot; a n@@ atives who didn &apos;t want to be called said , &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and one has even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evi@@ denti@@ ary collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible have an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine , when we present our case . &quot;
Birken@@ hof to the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is taken from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closing of the hotel Birken@@ hof through the then Ambiente of Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , about 30 000 nights spent per year lost and also income from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district , the hotel building was offered as an accommodation , which caused controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospective buyers in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has long been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; cosm@@ opol@@ itan &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an elevated downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ists , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and tourist director Michael Kr@@ ause , he has already led , so sha@@ vers . &quot;
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the exterior installations are also brought to the fore , which is clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; a large terrace , which is open to the public , creates a patio in a courtyard . &quot;
&quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler Robert Mu@@ eller was said to have set up a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; the committee recorded the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to persons familiar with the matter . &quot;
the newspaper ta@@ sted the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller was wi@@ dened and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
the CN@@ N station reported that there were already first charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time to be targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were negotiations between Tr@@ um@@ ps Elec@@ toral team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to face who acted as advis@@ ers to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Sonder@@ erer Tr@@ ump has personally moved into the centre and investigate whether the President possibly hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand J@@ uries is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called Ank@@ le Cham@@ bers .
&quot; most of the time , they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite individuals to the company under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ loads have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , said it in the report . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps Consult@@ ant and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his former Elec@@ toral Director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were there . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the translation shows that Mu@@ eller does not shy away in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end , in order to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the overthrow of the Gre@@ mi@@ um was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia history is a total invention , &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
&quot; the theme of the Democrats gives the democr@@ ats a possibility of &quot; &quot; feeling good &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he would not know anything about setting a Grand Jury .
&quot; this work , however , is usually in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House endor@@ ses any action that ha@@ sten@@ ed the work of the Sonder@@ erer on a &quot; fair &quot; way .
&quot; the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times , that it was not determined against the president . &quot;
&quot; there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; because of this bul@@ ging , alle@@ g@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he has hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special promot@@ er and his staff . &quot;
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to dism@@ iss .
&quot; unlike an independent promot@@ er of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later res@@ igned president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theore@@ tically could be fired from the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move . &quot;
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented bills of legislation on Thursday , after which the off@@ erer could no longer be dismis@@ sed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic ice mountain drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ice mountain has been solved by the barely seven times of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the big col@@ os@@ sus poured over a tril@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometer stretch now to the north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 miles of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for man from him .
&quot; as far as climate change has played a role in the fall of the ic@@ eberg , research data is un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual fl@@ aps in the region for some 30 years , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the split Kol@@ oss now has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swim on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; North of this dish , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed some years ago . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f file is in danger , as the front edge has never gone as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the sla@@ b is under tension and can be dis@@ infected if there is a piece of scrap on a key point . &quot;
&quot; melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level , as it float on the water and pus@@ hes ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow more quickly than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only margin@@ ally , writes the British research project to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI information , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f is the fourth biggest ho@@ stage of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is conscious , the Eis@@ schild now enters a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf should grow again or go back in the long run and possibly collap@@ ses , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not lead the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ eberg to climate change , in the past decades many ice @-@ tu@@ fts of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula are falling apart . &quot;
this long tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature was attribut@@ able to the decline in temperature .
&quot; in the past 50 years , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has heated around three degrees and thus counts to the areas in which the temperature is the fastest sti@@ ff . &quot;
CDU ( CDU ) wants to be a house@@ keeper at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant jobs , the CDU calls for the CDU to join the employers &apos; association in order to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new positions in administration took place in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have left their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very sought after .
some 620 applicants were registered for the places to be for@@ warded this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are still 50 un@@ occupied positions in the group M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration . &quot;
the CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the parties &quot; wishes , the administration aims to develop a concept for sta@@ ff@@ ing personnel and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter the future @-@ oriented application short@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself both internally and extern@@ ally , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and involve the CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know in the past .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a real &quot; competition by the public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service of illness or age . &quot;
so it is time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the common proposal with his party . &quot;
he had long been worried about a big surprise when he publicly questioned the sta@@ ff@@ ing costs and st@@ un@@ ned the remaining parties .
people want all the possibilities to be reviewed which enable exit from the local employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfying solution at short notice , the county government should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the affiliated towns - a home tari@@ ff , &quot; states nations . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CDU , the employees and officials , is trying to pay better than it actually looks at the tari@@ ff for public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level that is oriented to professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown increasingly in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be established in which employees care about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone of NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express himself to the detailed alle@@ g@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can assess all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , after we have collected all the information and ass@@ essing the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ su@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is presum@@ ed that its crew adop@@ ts tu@@ din@@ ous migrants aboard , which can be delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was allegedly only held 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of imposing on the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as I@@ su@@ v@@ enta must first have an Italian police officer , who over@@ sees their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far been willing to stick to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel Prize winner organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Minn@@ iti said meanwhile that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharp@@ ly in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing the efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Palat@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; look@@ out points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Palat@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between , there was repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer asc@@ ents , for the long Tri@@ als p@@ opp@@ y . &quot;
on the second day went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again the look@@ out point to the viewpoint , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and cottages brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .

&quot; after 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga prepar@@ es itself for e @-@ sports
do the sport stars in future sit in front of computer con@@ soles instead of swe@@ ating through wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high guests . &quot;
these have also recognized the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine which are increasingly engaged in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for FIFA 17 &apos;s computer game . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; that there are still some clubs to climb on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend FIFA World Association organiz@@ es the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in London , where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;

also Robin D@@ utt can see great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be much more likely to be present on these markets by far more often than once a year to send the federal bond to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the FIFA World Cup play FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; they have long since established themselves as well as in normal sports , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in Asia , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it a real sport at all ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly used to get used to it . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber has long been dealing with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can be found in classical sports , for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive abilities , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction ability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to carry through on @-@ line games and in the scene lack@@ ed the structures of classic sports .
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports .
&quot; players are travelling internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros were implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and major tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundes@@ liga , this is not enough . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are already many countries .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez join the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood @-@ actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e @-@ sports bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football league matches , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an E @-@ Sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; says V@@ f@@ B CEO Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to decay , and to clarify the old times , is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; it is about keeping the association &apos;s tradition , but at the same time al@@ ig@@ ning the company on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a dig@@ itali@@ zed world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to it , that only when football everything is as it always was . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy press for suicide , condemned &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been abandoned . &quot;
Carter was sentenced to life in June by Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter rose with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
she ended his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no regre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters Att@@ orney @-@ at @-@ Law said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they fully regret . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t feel the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I turn with everything . I try , in spite of all my pains that we will bear with us for eternity , for his sisters there . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer the only person I have been working with since my birth , is a pain that I will always be keeping with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to urge others to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention to itself , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang up , leap from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad , &quot; and &quot; All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit by any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few who defended Carter owned Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in Italy for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
it &apos;s not a coinci@@ dence that Joshua Kim joined the Audi Cup as a captain .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut a great season to the F@@ ed @-@ Cup winner - Extra motivation is not doing there .
&quot; something else was different in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim right away , even though the additional piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neuer were to be seen , he made a rush to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; told the F@@ ed @-@ Cup winner after his first deployment as Bayern captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the level could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach could be suggest@@ ing Kim@@ i as well .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of vacation , but he was chosen as a game leader . &quot;
sugar is best distributed to those whom you have a lot of dar@@ ing to keep in humor .
&quot; so , who was chosen to compete in Lah@@ m &apos;s legacy , can only use a small extra motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ashed out as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
&quot; to the right , that is its position , the white binding on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all Kim@@ i worked in this starting @-@ formation like the one , who can best take the helm in his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the in@@ filtr@@ ated tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had a look at the whole , while many others were occupied with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal thus , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( left little ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , to link to dev@@ ils , to get out of the services of the Asia journey ( fold also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le are not neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ tri@@ cot . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked very well . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ i , Rud@@ y ran off against the def@@ enses , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ ßer was also trying to successfully temp@@ t himself in the game @-@ building a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot;

firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
this shows more than a year in which the new Minister for Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
Cham@@ bers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old ministers .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , President of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ser attacks the wishes of the economy , which has all blocked Lem@@ ke . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the ministry hopes for a plant@@ ation process until 2021 is supposed to be the right of construction . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Chanc@@ ell@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ forem@@ an Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive businesses . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) of Trier aims to increase the market value of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports bag@@ ging for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; in the new Master bonus , the Trier Chamber of Crafts will provide an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
a bonus of 1000 Euro is provided for the master exam and 2500 euros if graduates are self @-@ employed in the course of ten years after the master &apos;s training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; in the planned road construction , there are quick facts to create , but at the same time the country fails to provide the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , the main Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ ser at state @-@ owned mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; comm@@ enting on calculations of the Court , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the maintenance of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
so@@ ber@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies evaluated the grid supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ outs .
&quot; in contrast , ex @-@ economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine Pro Wind . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field after four months of discre@@ pan@@ cies .
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said the company believes that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and related themselves to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as call@@ back .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers to install systems for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases e@@ jected from diesel vehicles also increases , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of h@@ itting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
&quot; companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen &apos;s mistakes that could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation equipment that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; several employees were charged by Volkswagen in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former Head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and may be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities of Audi accused Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously strain Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .

&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft is driving through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;

porn @-@ Movie with Pin@@ a@@ Pop@@ p
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at times one of the most widely published carto@@ on@@ ists , the n@@ oll@@ enn@@ esses of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ inian is still drawing and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the early years as an artist , he represented himself as dra@@ fts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; following stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the Six@@ ties : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; big , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; according to his own information early in the morning , he is still sitting on the table today , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; about cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ ll figures continue to be widespread worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los random animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counter player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D movie , which will be scre@@ ened to the movie screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that &apos;s why he tends to focus on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced verb@@ ally . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threat@@ ens climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der is decl@@ ining because of the conditions borne by d@@ rought and because of the diseases transmitted by insects , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions are causing great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the agricultural research institution CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has an effect on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf c@@ ic@@ adas , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts attention not only for tourists but also for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of the ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sha in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 years anniversary .
the highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a middle age fest .
&quot; Krä@@ mer , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ants or a land camp are to be seen in the city centre these days . &quot;
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , ever since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 and until now , there have been at least seven dead in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , showing his smile face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der @-@ Bundes@@ an@@ wal@@ den was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has conducted only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked every year with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , journalists are rarely charged by journalists . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ dova , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and though the terrain is still more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we don &apos;t mi@@ str@@ ust ourselves . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he just managed to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla had been stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; &quot; twel@@ fth &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or several people are shot on the road every day or that the cemetery is full of complicated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce , has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February , the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to not comp@@ el Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , leaving the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he served as an experienced repor@@ ter in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing a problem of nar@@ cot@@ ics , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and public@@ ity increased . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it hin@@ dered . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the job that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the ri@@ odo@@ ce team mix@@ es Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse as a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love of routine his destruction ?
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how to do their job best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their cann@@ y starting and landing flags , &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instin@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anno@@ y@@ ance is , said the editor of the Ri@@ vo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is done with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor himself designated as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce li@@ cked three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of former well @-@ known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the government spending that focused on the home town of the governor .
&quot; there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosec@@ utor , conducted a kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly the entire century all the political levels . &quot;
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped military assault . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers had seen Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source about kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was reloc@@ ated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees had become something they would never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the public prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials said , based on DNA tests that it is its . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der because they have written down in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and letting them kill them because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since asked that she is re@@ parti@@ tioned by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; however , Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials , and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces who stuck with the organised crime under a blank@@ et . &quot;
&quot; at Artic@@ ul@@ o 19 , the media alarm group &quot; Artic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
apparently the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was suppos@@ edly signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were lying next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo performed after the murder of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ elle with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with high @-@ risk choices . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug traffi@@ cking start@@ led him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and so I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ vo@@ ce were sitting at the side@@ walk in front of the office and drinking beer , as suddenly all their phones began to h@@ um . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ val ri@@ vals and security forces near the spa of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a number of anti@@ trust messages in the region .
from the on@@ board edge they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phones .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens flock nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ dova followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the tra@@ inees asked me to send them for reporting on the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ouflage to avoid its enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ ort of a Canadian mining worker have been preserved so well that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even find that its fl@@ ak@@ y skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said it would have had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the guar@@ ded arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r , ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well preserved condition has aston@@ ished scientists , which describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met on something that seemed out of the surrounding rock on the board , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best received din@@ osau@@ r specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing shell , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ weight , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to interfere with its surroundings better and to avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million year old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli following the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the astonishing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ our over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the sh@@ ado@@ wing , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r has been hun@@ ted by enough pressure through eating car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ado@@ wing - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as lo@@ ot , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dose @-@ carrier was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to study the animal on evidence of his life , including its preserved intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs when he died , fell into a river and dri@@ fted into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flour@@ ishes today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther far@@ ther far@@ ther than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative fl@@ ak@@ y skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the beast , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cre@@ tac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you have just a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period was a time when giant ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , passed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the King of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fear@@ ful ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the guar@@ ded arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that ra@@ ined from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded flow flo@@ ods into the open sea .
but the underwater re@@ funds of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
&quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the Hau@@ bar@@ ley still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a winning lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I watch it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ nage .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ re long rods - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass @-@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age in the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first data of the police , there were about 30 vehicles between the districts of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; on the exact number of the injured , no details will initially be given . &quot;
&quot; it was a light to medium @-@ weight injury , said a police officer . &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in direction of Munich .
&quot; in direction of direction Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re back@@ stage was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter reports , it also occurred on the opposite way to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle handle@@ bars , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
German Rail : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is stuck in the train and sle@@ eps .
or one is deep@@ ening into his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
&quot; comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ hing , or swe@@ eps the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot;
ticket inspec@@ tions .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspec@@ tions .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer depends , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in , &quot; the train calls the ticket de@@ valuation without the conductor . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which already do most passengers .
&quot; you must also have purchased the app from the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works like that : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; the train companion when ticket inspec@@ tions goes to No. Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep quiet . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn is to use passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to travel without ticket inspec@@ tions by our train crew , check out the DB Navigator software . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing management board . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often goes by train , knows that in addition to delays and missed moves , ticket inspec@@ tions are among the greatest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for many times , however , one of the passengers does not have all the documentation needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or ID card is missing , or otherwise a document you have to assign . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger , leading to bad mood in part or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further conc@@ essions on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; whose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after she arrived in New York City , she sat in St. Louis &apos; s bed on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
they stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , as no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly sa@@ vi@@ ed on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to tweet live . &quot;
he posted an image of Brown &apos;s li@@ fel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours .
date : 06 / 14 / 2009 Size :
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she removed her cell phone to return later in the evening to Twe@@ ets on people at the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman took his gun and sh@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell reminded her of her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we are accu@@ stom@@ ed to and which we can call typical .
at this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power , which consists of the people &apos;s point of view , who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take it with me , &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know it and it must be seen and raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we have to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is not different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after August 9 , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , focusing on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rell passed Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film during an evening demonstration . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said that she and her cam@@ er@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by inn@@ um@@ erable cases of men , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his engagement brought the project near@@ er to Fer@@ rell , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that in the movement &quot; not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but about a community coming together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the incar@@ nation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who , following the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , have marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement is truly held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , she insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence although it was at the foref@@ ront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police stations in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway during a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoliti@@ cal atmosphere of the area that it calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ings herself to a song and she feels committed to that memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ in@@ ct split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject hardly leaves the issue cold .
the subject is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say , &quot; This would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t you need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while pro@@ pon@@ ents are building that a gallery draws more customers into the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian prec@@ in@@ ct is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct marketing markets offer their products . &quot;
at the beginning of the construction work will be an end .
the gallery owners want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lords were always happy again and again . &quot;
also the but@@ cher &apos;s shop was discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities this is also possible .
especially the small mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery is located , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this might not be very low in the new project . &quot;
Rezension : Ian Mc@@ E@@ wan : &quot; sweet To@@ oth &quot;
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough of them in our city .
you see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , stores are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the rental shops there are often not tra@@ ce@@ able for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; sorry , special shops are almost no longer available and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping centre with a Mark@@ thalle didn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall be in the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery actually arrives .
or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery before selling all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that is empty doesn &apos;t need any .
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place . &quot;
&quot; when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
&quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly identical - which hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ seg@@ gen that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth prison where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after secre@@ tly classified diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks site .
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is named A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dis@@ sident , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his post . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , a sharp , though some intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already talked openly about the identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison their image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg passed straight from the great success of its 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and che@@ wing gum , by extracted the DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal British friends who exchanged several letters in the course of two years .
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , predicted a future in which the President would convert the verdi@@ ct in person and would be able to see the exhibition in person . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome sort of happy coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to continue to infl@@ ame the rigid circuits that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things are going to happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing asked in an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic disper@@ sion , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg wanted to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in the biological view , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome is not responsible for who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , are also visible . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above comic novel . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing how she emerg@@ es with a free speech in hand from the Dis@@ cipl@@ ines of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they put up your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets out of Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the space by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ les , which gather together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their gene@@ tical hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an Associ@@ ate of the University of Oxford because of killing
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at the North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who was searched as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Regional Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead in the scene of the action , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigating the engra@@ vings as murder while the police actively sought after the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ ase , vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them may now be in certified and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus . &quot;
this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College stated in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every possible way .
&quot; the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked , wanting to stand up . &quot;
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he requested the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident occurred on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and expl@@ ores a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA timet@@ able in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented to restore Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA timet@@ able was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA schedule to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ release R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the approval approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in the Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA as part of the D@@ oping sc@@ andal in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs any more
they shared the divisions of the company .
&quot; it was a pure precau@@ tion , it could further be assumed by no health impair@@ ment , it was said in the announcement . &quot;

Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency in its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to compete with your employees at your e @-@ commerce startup @-@ up , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the Gro@@ wing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to address surveys , support staff anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers manage to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees &quot; commitment . &quot;
she said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T won .
&quot; in addition to the s@@ nap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low cons@@ ents results - so that you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the Fin@@ anz@@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ LIN@@ T , Conver@@ cent allows companies to send customized &quot; pul@@ sing &quot; surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat @-@ maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the supervisory board . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that does not treat its employees badly or behave in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience expensive consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has used Conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to prosec@@ ute the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company Conver@@ cent ple@@ ases , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair inter@@ ns quickly identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations caused by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Conver@@ cent offer their software as a service and pol@@ lu@@ te the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of firms such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ y secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its overall financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising considering the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are more likely to expect from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s . &quot;
staff want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices are heard , and that the work you do is well worth it , then they feel more strongly committed to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both conver@@ sely and G@@ LIN@@ T are used . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ tes when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , there may be an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can grow dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 comments , you have to be prepared to have 4,000 queries , &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; Why do you really hear me ? &quot;
do you take care of this ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly workers &apos; surveys , was able to launch measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so saved . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not committed to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose businesses . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it goes to 23 : 00 when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey units and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center on the next morning .
&quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was closed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has leng@@ th@@ ened their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already fully packed schedule of players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the Bru@@ ges shifted the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time while Mor@@ as performed six times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
20 before the start of formal play preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supported the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the gam@@ bl@@ ers &apos; busy routes . &quot;
&quot; we put this tremendous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed through , they spread themselves further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is termin@@ ated , in view of the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been abandoned with foot balls , which will be a protective net behind a door@@ post , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; bru@@ ins gam@@ bl@@ ers should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room and then set up an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a fairly good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ checking in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and their results below the original contribution then show , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible mis@@ understand@@ ings and to send them to fac@@ tual checks , which may possibly display results of the fact exam from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters to be floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to quickly recti@@ fy hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts verification is started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the insight that stories of third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has lived 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat at the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ary . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England spann@@ ed the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Ste@@ e@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell after smoke , because at that time one lighted a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he was himself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so beaten with old papers he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; &quot; ) this is all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the installed hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care , gar@@ dening and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , employees began to take care of the archive , which he referred to as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristoc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent what possessed : &quot; it could mean that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des said , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se in English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revol@@ t of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the peasant revol@@ t started in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons that the Dar@@ rell family hidden during the English re@@ formation seven years . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is portra@@ yed out of the 18th century , which filled his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery which was only completed years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always make debt and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying out rich old wives - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise their land@@ lady . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique write experiences &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the consec@@ ration of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team wish to keep Nelson Art@@ z &apos;s logo and slogan secret . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we do not really think ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their website that was released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
&quot; and to make it clear , that some things are better than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as a Bad Honne@@ fer are very well aware of the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is about more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot;
&quot; it is necessary to form@@ ulate an omni@@ present promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the City of Bad Honnef welcomes its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , Ankara advis@@ es the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ sion@@ ings and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the head of government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliber@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in number . &quot;
the government dra@@ gs the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the na@@ vy have been dismis@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; since the Cou@@ p , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired out 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the clin@@ cher of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 48@@ 6 persons , who are supposed to have been directly involved in the attempted coup attempt , this week in Ankara is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan described the attempt to overthrow the &quot; &quot; God &apos;s present &quot; &quot; as he had given him the opportunity to fully clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ha@@ iry in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ i@@ ani@@ zation &quot; of the army which , among other things , manifest@@ ing itself in the lifting of the head@@ scarf ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the major coach in the army and the security forces goes on .
&quot; in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan suffered further 73@@ 95 heads of state , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they stimul@@ ated their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; following his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan over@@ threw the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt in fear of persecution in foreign countries , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this happens , such a development could not leave Nato cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he pre@@ fers to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill shall be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by issu@@ ing the US the way citizens from other countries are dealt with Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the migration of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; this new evaluation procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; says Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to refurb@@ ish track for road@@ way shuttle
&quot; again and again over the past few months over the future of the race @-@ platform sh@@ utt@@ les had been fought - now , it should go very fast . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , it is supposed to be built on the mar@@ vel@@ ous track on which the tourist train runs . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race @-@ platform sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will start on the track this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country turns to this important link above all for tourism , &quot; declared road secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of over@@ hau@@ ling the track was about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country will exceed 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future from the country will be finally voted , said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as an operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; in this way , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the rac@@ et@@ rack Shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , a pilot company has been tested to determine whether the route is used by enough many people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
the track is also heavily damaged in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots comes . &quot;
yes indeed .
sex robots are a big thing at the moment .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Rob@@ otik ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ ul@@ ls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a progressive woman progres@@ sively . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ ul@@ ators have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for instance , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they look appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ sh@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots developed by True Compani@@ on with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compani@@ on website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , it also has its mo@@ ods - like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the sub@@ missive female qualities , the all@@ usions to rape if one walks a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. : contradic@@ tory ) Far@@ rah , quit one the most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have any Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement indicate somewhat dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ gation as an optional enc@@ ore .
&quot; most men will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes its increasing popularity , they remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ aks out of the periph@@ ery , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots face in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ iled to have women sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most det@@ err@@ ent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the dev@@ oured body and the pierc@@ ed eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
&quot; they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that points to independence or anything , which might distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : maid
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
&quot; it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which have polar@@ ised the US elec@@ torate , have also split families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving there were newspapers in the United States with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all pur@@ por@@ ted ourselves to let our filter bub@@ bles burst .
&quot; less noticeable is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , to bring families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ directed bree@@ der who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , anyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship with which it had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is important to me that this ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the decre@@ asing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be thrown away . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; which suddenly appear to be the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ b@@ orian version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump actually occurred as a very mild off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally fit to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the biggest of the Car@@ ousel of the New York Park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are cra@@ cking and the animals are twi@@ sting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ pping music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are getting old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the topic pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park Car@@ us@@ el is still a strange magical experience , since two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to slo@@ wing down what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to put personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store ap@@ ologi@@ zed ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically , while I had tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of s@@ lei@@ ghs , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence because of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by throwing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say it is too cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence increases to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ bergs schools , the four @-@ door sler from F@@ utzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were dischar@@ ged into the school holidays and into the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the exp@@ atri@@ ate students will attend school in the future , four at the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen . &quot;
&quot; as a symbol of the dism@@ iss@@ al of the school , the 29 pupils of the four classes were elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , a young Adler who grew up in the chicken yard , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower cabinet introduced a musical with the title &quot; The eagle in the chicken court . &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and left it out of his chi@@ ckens .
&quot; instead of a hen , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken , and the eag@@ les spread out his wings on a high mountain and swa@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the recording of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who carried cylin@@ ders to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young animal is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished each four @-@ person @-@ person that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; this was followed by a word of gratitude to colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who again and again jumps at teaching posts , and the parent representatives . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ away time was over now , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only rel@@ inqu@@ ishes lessons very un@@ inten@@ tionally because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door @-@ sler . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; with the children , great joy broke out among the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ class sler has already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally killing people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of free camps and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
checks are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine penalty .
software update for Diesel @-@ Vehic@@ les : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
the aim is to improve the emission characteristics of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new promotion obligatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates that are dealt with are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles , the Schumann software , &quot; &quot; said Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Kraft@@ fahr@@ er@@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; manufacturers have announced quick implementation in the next few months , but no exact date is yet known . &quot;
Daimler had reported to write to each person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done in its framework . &quot;
how long should the retro@@ fits be drawn altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the slopes depend on manufacturers &apos; commitment and political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
&quot; presum@@ ably , foreign manufacturers would be attra@@ cting , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is there a threat of a massive decline in the price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
A@@ ce fears that .
but just in the regions where dri@@ ve@@ ways are threatening .
&quot; in rural areas , there have been no losses in value for older diesel . &quot;

the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners will not come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars . &quot;
the awards will be awarded at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump is hosting a reception together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony . &quot;
&quot; the award winner Le@@ ar , who has been announ@@ cing the progressive TV series , has already announced that he will for@@ go participation at the g@@ ala . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; This pres@@ idency has decided to completely negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and it bur@@ dens me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she would use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clarify their views .
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Zentrum , named after the former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written out - however , appropriate applicants are rare . &quot;
since 31 years W@@ acker is a city builder .
and the work still makes him great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press brief@@ ing .
&quot; he reports from varied , but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it adm@@ ires that no application has been made to fulfil the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible moment .
&quot; in compliance with the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the Administr@@ ative community as a Lower Construction Authority , the applicant has to provide appropriate conclusion . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice . &quot;
&quot; but the city and the city itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reported a good working climate and a good mood between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in ministry , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city viable , &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its staff . &quot;
but also in the future there are diversi@@ fied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Areal and the Dutch parking lot .
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; only the latter will be@@ vel at around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; If we do it correctly , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
st@@ aging is available for a municipal building master large playing room .
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and a gar@@ dener , many things can be re@@ acted quite flexi@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble is listed as a monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what is to be missed &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city builder emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the city builder has a great responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; in the end everything runs through my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor will stay for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who wants to really identify and stay with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment but also for the further design of the city .
&quot; if you would like to be a Roland W@@ acker , after information from the city of Has@@ lach you should have a completed degree course as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with speci@@ alizing in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Municipal Building Department is subject to civil and civil engineering , construction management , basic rights matters , management of urban properties , Municipal Fac@@ ilities with Bau@@ hof and Municipal Gar@@ dening Service as well as the Lower Construction Authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on pi@@ pel@@ ines closed : southern railway line closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike from the rail@@ road crossing in the area of Le@@ oben Strasse ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines . &quot;
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been looking for them since the night hours .
&quot; near the crime scene , a ros@@ ar@@ et sco@@ oter and a bike rider were observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Lus@@ ati@@ an region , &quot; said Ö@@ BB Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators had brought themselves into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the costs of rail freight transport , the cul@@ pr@@ its of the railway customers could also be given to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people were absent for Friday morning , two of them considered the long @-@ distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains were not cancelled , but they were delayed . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA and in the UK 300,000 causes ga@@ stri@@ c cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody diarr@@ hea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues .
&quot; if the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve immune cell occurs in mice with a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; it suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet toler@@ ant of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han enhances a toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel movement if the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan looked for a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was however housed separately , had not had this . &quot;
&quot; they presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
the intest@@ ines of mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells but lack@@ ed them in mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were obtained by L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria looked at the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transmitted small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was cle@@ ans@@ ed from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ es were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells such as mice and that most of us have L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ cts .
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in humans with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote since these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the intest@@ ines &apos;s internal surface . &quot;
&quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ es in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i , can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ und Sig@@ nature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cks off Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed the owner &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week the Independent revealed that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but insi@@ sted that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary obligations . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given themselves great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew off Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turned , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister still looked forward with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only there was no fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation - this was the most important desire of the elec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus also observe the events in the SPD @-@ governing state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , a head@@ wind wouldn &apos;t be described in the approach . &quot;
there were ra@@ inf@@ all .
and one by one .
&quot; according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CDU sees a general signal against coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green cannot be reliably ruled out , &quot; said CDU , Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising group of S &amp; D Euro MPs has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the elections , its Red @-@ Green coalition sign@@ alled its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition of CDU and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transition to the CDU signi@@ fies a clear counter@@ fei@@ ting of the voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the German Managing Director and election director of the Green Party Executive Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; an SPD elec@@ tor si@@ gh@@ ed , when the new job message was reached on Friday morning . &quot;

it is the pro@@ visional highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD Land feder@@ ations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades reas@@ sured at that time . &quot;
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
it became even worse - and it became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD ins , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te won the party smooth . &quot;
the comrades in the weeks later stir@@ red up te@@ di@@ ously .
&quot; then , when they had just got new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit of Hamburg was coming . &quot;
and with him came the next depression .
&quot; Mayor Olaf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he was doing pretty much wrong in the crisis communication , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism since a long time . &quot;
additional survey results were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or maybe even so , Wei@@ l tried to set acc@@ ents in the federal government in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the endeav@@ our of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , also remained un@@ covered by comrades in the context of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him go as they promised to stabil@@ ise the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party @-@ internal pressures of the Lower Saxony Green Party in essence no guilt . &quot;
and Schulz does not know at all .
&quot; at times , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ anism T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen provides her own career opport@@ uni@@ es on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , the Lower Saxony MP . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .

&quot; four years ago , the voters were clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CDU dep@@ u@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or have given further commitments to the CDU Niedersachsen .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
those who want to be rehabil@@ itated over the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; on Wednesday , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ST@@ EC Urban Development informed them on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a look back to what happened . &quot;
since 1991 it has been in sens@@ ational refurb@@ ishment areas .
&quot; at the time , in the restoration area I of 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing renovation projects are a &quot; success story &quot; - finally it is important to promote the development of the interior and not only open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Federal Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III . &quot;
&quot; the total funding amount was 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the commun@@ e sensi@@ tivities . &quot;
what is the result of a re@@ development area ?
&quot; so Sch@@ in@@ dler will continue to investigate , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether in the planned territory there is any interest to be rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could also be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening , the ST@@ EC represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the Bund @-@ Länder @-@ program &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ ale Stadt &quot; , &quot; where the refurb@@ ishment would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working relationships and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot . &quot;
the restoration area would then finally be determined as a stat@@ ute .
the period of approval for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; until September of this year , however , the inventory should be carried out only once , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionna@@ ire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the constitution should be carried out as soon as possible , so that the refurb@@ ishment will begin next year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each commun@@ e had to carry out the said pre @-@ investigations . &quot;
it is a question of evalu@@ ating the town &apos;s ab@@ uses and deciding when it is refurb@@ ished and to what extent .
for the respective property there is also a rec@@ ap@@ itali@@ zation report written in the basement .
&quot; once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensi@@ tivities and become a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a major success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; this is why there will be questionna@@ ires , which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionna@@ ire is the &quot; &quot; building and development arch &quot; , &quot; in which it works among other things the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionna@@ ire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; questionna@@ ire , information about size , layout and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; can only be filled out if the premises are operated in the building .
&quot; however , to be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionna@@ ire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphas@@ ised that the distribution of the funds according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; is working - who comes first comes first . &quot;
you cannot reserve a subsi@@ dy for later &quot; reserve . &quot;
&quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; Orts@@ kern II &quot; &quot; were shown in order to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand@@ shake . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consultant an@@ aes@@ thesi@@ ologist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; Mr North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
the married father of one has now built in both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the promotional costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production in the last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military personnel left to the TIME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officer of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ k@@ lift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his super@@ visor , deputy na@@ val commander for aviation . &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed due to the limitation of the working hours a second team would need for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight number was at the helicopter during the event , while the security staff remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; from the recordings provided by TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight was necessary . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the purpose .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform of health reform underway in the Senate and propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; in February Tr@@ ump completed an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all over 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; as a rough start at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 training land@@ ings at the White House in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted for the training needs of the flight number for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential Sup@@ por@@ ting missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took charge of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have bud@@ get@@ ary desig@@ nations for the presidential par@@ agra@@ phs , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the US Department of Defense for the budget year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
unit Records recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are manufactured in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man car . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and sh@@ ou@@ ted with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

how America can harm the OM@@ V
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he set his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for tigh@@ tening sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his capacity to en@@ act the law , the Congress adopted a few &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; and et@@ ched it . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sp@@ ammed the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to pun@@ ish European companies that help Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors have been troubled by domestic OM@@ V , which co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian East Soul North Stream 2 together with other European companies . &quot;
the dr@@ one is enormous .
&quot; however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to bring even the sanctions to life by Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .

roll back : the city provides 46 kitchens
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock is returned .
&quot; on September 1 , the city Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ reg@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth aid department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking continues except for home : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked food .
&quot; the city runs in the Kre@@ feld area 46 child@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; in the last kit@@ ten year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for at 45 hours , in the K@@ ita lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered dishes , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , portions the meal individually , give the food off , clean off , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; said Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as seven @-@ group units - decides on the extent of the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen heroes are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; said Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more involved and it is easier for the administration to implement educational concepts . &quot;
because that &apos;s what it is all about : healthy eating and cooking .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is meaning@@ less .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - is done by special cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm of the kitchen power , as well as the charm that it turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison of the city as the most economical one , is it from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and this , although 46 sub @-@ time forces will be re @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
&quot; the Taliban have released threats against a election process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will hand over the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent elec@@ toral commission reported that 1.2 million women from a total registered 3.6 million elec@@ tors were registered .

G@@ MB concern about investments at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to ensure a long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant in Man@@ ege of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ zier .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has been silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ flow location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces bis@@ cu@@ its and rich tea bis@@ cu@@ its besides other products . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds over the past few years .
he added that employees and union representatives would be &quot; the first to experience &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ zier &apos;s call on &quot; &quot; expressing concern that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of employment , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person by Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to it as we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ onica , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continually review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ onica facility , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ onica as a production site fully and completely . if our operations are changed at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
La Liga © s interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti regre@@ ts
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not succ@@ um@@ b to Ne@@ ym@@ ar after receiving an offer of £ 189 million in order to release his release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the World record attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than twice the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after the end , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way out , although there is a source near the Catal@@ ans board that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti in the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

Rezension : Ian Mc@@ E@@ wan : &quot; sweet To@@ oth &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen will continue for discussion .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; stated after publication in relation to the German Press Agency , he received an ap@@ ology from the former R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false assessment of the events .
&quot; on the other hand , the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that the report on violence was measured with &quot; two measurements . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in respect of the enc@@ ro@@ ach@@ ments in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; to be punished and prevented in the future ; but striking is the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; , &quot; writes the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; you &apos;re welcome to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; stro@@ kes have been a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they found it un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports of abuse , pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wron@@ g@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take the protection of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with En@@ ligh@@ tenment recognised by the lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; altogether 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sex@@ ually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 domain cats . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was even more severe . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other compl@@ aining , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence covering violence at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many disciples highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became pal@@ p@@ able by the econom@@ ist when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz musi@@ cally produced no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as your bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you do the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all . &quot;
he is just eight pages dedicated and it is clearly revealed by any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the acts of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool occ@@ ured beyond its sphere of influence .
&quot; one can at best repro@@ ach him , to get out of it too late or to have taken first hints seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the high school gym@@ nasi@@ um on which he worked , was perceived as literally &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this way , the broad majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provides an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; and &quot; honest &quot; teacher who provided the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and cand@@ y and &quot; always lag@@ ged by children &apos;s grapes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and high emotion@@ ality , which also led to qu@@ arri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he did not only pop up with chairs and threw the mu@@ zzle on the floor , but also put ear @-@ fei@@ gn@@ ed and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself had already given him years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I too have experienced this in a secular school , a state grammar school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , that is certainly Bag@@ at@@ ellen . &quot;
&quot; one wonders if it is not more concerned with his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just collap@@ sed on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media in connection with the report a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was reported in the media .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have entrusted to the cathedral cap@@ ella .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a victim of the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in the education of sexual abuse , however , is that most of the victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
what is the rate of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insight and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is reck@@ oned to him ... Bu@@ ben un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive or clear or even more open than against their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ories , confidence teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; concerning sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of any co @-@ author . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to link his good name to these vile crimes , as it happened in some cases . &quot;
in the media much of &quot; acts of violence &quot; were to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
&quot; the former cathedral @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was charged in the report &quot; &quot; Weg@@ visor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and anywhere , in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; clearly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other repro@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir leader of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were quite lay@@ ered and en@@ for@@ c@@ aged , all took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have prev@@ ailed . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do with the cathedral @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he didn &apos;t get the boys to face when they were already at the domain gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the theme &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; paradise &quot; . &quot; &quot;
what was different at the gym@@ nasi@@ um gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline already , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even bring positive memories to it despite violence . &quot;
&quot; thus , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut down the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the high school gym@@ nasi@@ um that the report was actually reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out this , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test penalty will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pen@@ alties were banned in Bavaria too long ago . &quot;
&quot; before this , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where those affected might be over@@ done or dram@@ ati@@ sed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; however , one cannot say that he had always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis affir@@ med that it was un@@ fair to apply the current ped@@ ago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we have been talking about &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of jud@@ ging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess is already right .
&quot; but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that then . &quot;
this is all horri@@ ble and I am happy that it will finally be worked up .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take the protection of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. pinn@@ ac@@ kles and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , it also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what image of his Regen@@ s@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger given in conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of exam@@ iner also available for speech ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XVI@@ . , tells from his perspective , since the cathedral @-@ cats only played a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I didn &apos;t deny that he was there a strict regim@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly be possible for him to form a cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons alone you don &apos;t even make a great singer and before every success , just in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work in the book and beyond , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep @-@ temper@@ ed , deeply beli@@ ever and heart @-@ good people , of whom one cannot imagine that he could only do a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly receive regular contact with him , like many former domain cats , 23 years after his em@@ bodi@@ ment , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was stern to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; today , most of the domain cats are thank@@ ful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he always was a good father , a strict father , certainly that might be - but also a lovely resp@@ ectable person , to which they still look up today and to rever@@ e them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all you have accused of are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make a sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent that stands behind , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the propri@@ eties tend to have a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its , and probably none of Germany would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
