<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="3">"a chapel chapel, where it is now digged for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Kleingardener manages the former land of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that had to get excited because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a circumnavigation.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but it is therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flickenteppich which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture card, more detailed maps were drawn for towns and villages, so-called original composition sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were based on data from the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army chief occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops arrived with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Baden-Württemberg card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the" Topographical Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The certificate for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison of earlier / today is most impressive, for example, the capital of the state."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is subroutine, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was annexed 21 years after the map was created, thus 1877, as Munich-based district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, it is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses were concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a small-part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered flutes from the so-called" "urbanization" "from which the foundation stone was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"today, small plots prove no more farmers - but small gardeners of the plant" land in sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Unterendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October test, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete jungle in the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district there is not only the street name" "Gasteig" "or" "On the Lüften" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked up people with insanity."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich-based district of Irrenzu" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - that psychiatrist, who is brought to king Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and, for instance, ended the count of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he forbids the personnel to use force against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Regional Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"there was room for 280 patients, and later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirene Institute in Haar 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum meet now on the site of the former Auer institutions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with apprenticeships.</seg>
<seg id="42">"the football field of the TSV München East is located west, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was erected in architectural style by the Irrenanstalt's original construction, which was destroyed during World War II in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "main place", "the Kaufingerstrasse was called" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the precursors and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Federation for the Promotion of Colour has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory politics and racist attacks of the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will come into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents generally occur throughout the state and be noted here," it says in the group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to capitalize discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that disproportionately aim at minorities, prompted the group to issue the warning, the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, the people."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racial offense against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no longer been killed by the state and arrested by the Missouri police, without being accused of being a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be ready to bring chewing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which classifies the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for residential or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, following immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities pledge to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Subproject is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weighing-Project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentarians Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-grabber courtyard of the Schwendi family, representatives of the fishing village CDU-Ortsverband met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens and accommodated in five apartments Feriengeste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest Milk "is for him the alternative marketing track for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the BLHV president of Fischbach, he described the soft aunching project as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland area care for a lot of work, a lot must be machined with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parent company and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer although he does not conduct biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader funding. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the areas could be drawn up for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate," "emphasised the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">"because of the promotion, farmers often stand in criticism"</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure surface is 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted via leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers had a total of 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landlords it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood firm: "best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg provides state support for pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Pre-requisite is the presence of a conveyor set marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"furthermore, the area to be enclosed must not be manageable (rise above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence for the Fisherbach Fisherald project 2018, is currently under construction."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure surface is equivalent to 35 hectares, which is estimated at more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firon Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president to limit the legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have found him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he grabbed their importance, and in particular the meaning that it was written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the memorial, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance to the eavesdropping words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:"</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "iling waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a used classical illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American neativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early Neocon that brings the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh repelled here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elbow but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge, and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that of course is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not lighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two Scotts belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"Director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athlets was chosen for London 2017, which starts on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "something special develops in Scotland" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in her fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Schotten are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"until now, Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will participate in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman was in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be mixed with medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team mates have voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb on stage."</seg>
<seg id="155">What about my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so it is really important to rely on this home support, and to benefit from the fact that we are again at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critically via Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the Healing of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew a little bit of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he knocked in the critique, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid, we will be led as sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">"hogans staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people, expressing their opinion on their official facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the fifty governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary head of the head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilfully to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and to debuke his haarless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments would be nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people, who swing the whip online."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorneys Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, Md., was not bottled, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not like this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are considered by some rather than a so-called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the Governor's staff labelled as" "concentrated spam" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to slice a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in former times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical tapes or to arrest demonstrators and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Before (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be that difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portrayal had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondents beat his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had an anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"the petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overcame his office, according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organises 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, who last year led to the Archerfield left until the final round, before he lost against Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>
<seg id="209">"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieved his fame with this event," said Rafferty. "</seg>

<seg id="212">He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.</seg>
<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">"the Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, even though he has won the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career."</seg>
<seg id="215">"that really feels very special," "said the home-based player in Southport."</seg>
<seg id="216">"I did not defend Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year, after I had won it."</seg>
<seg id="217">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It is a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="221">"Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50th birthday, returns to his home soil for action."</seg>
<seg id="222">This event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you're playing at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh. "</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I am happy about the way it went.</seg>
<seg id="227">"the trio in the field are the former Masters-winner Ian Woosnam and Senior High Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty."</seg>
<seg id="228">"ORR and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond."</seg>

<seg id="259">"an existing movement, which stirred up for independence against the Dutch rule, turned swiftly against the government of Jakarta, which entertains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers."</seg>

<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as" a tragic, forgotten village. ""</seg>

<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's uneven easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation. "</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread injuries "in Papua including the Paniai shooting."</seg>

<seg id="376">"Jokhoi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice to Jokhoi as a" blame "he has to pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai victims had a last symbolic act of defiance: the bodies of a victim was buried on a site just across the police and the military station."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery areal in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday 16th July at 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village made the friends and supporters of Tumlingens to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische Urcustard: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the wording of the document, on the Mount Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church there was also a glorious courtyard, to which the church or patron of the patron belonged and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamelled Freudenstadt from 1858, along with the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the area of Tumlingen, the" "Berg" "of the third, the ancient settlement nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 are subject to this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right to patronate arose from the early medieval original church right.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied himself with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this self-church."</seg>
<seg id="478">This was linked to the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The elder of the two were crushed on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell then sounded in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were infiltrated and the bell panels were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were stationed near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Graveyard served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the tower-tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year of New Year in 1834, a storm broke the steeple and half crashed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower existing today remained as a witness to the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem care about the" "creative pensioners" "as successor to Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius facility."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tumlingens on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery at St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>

<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim wates" has prompted Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Viersen a wind force concentration zone existed only at the borderline to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are possible, at the same time, the concentration zone creates an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">"such zones are intended to prevent" "saving" "of the landscape."</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette, a few days ago, but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve, because of a form fault."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval letter is still unlawful and therefore resumed," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim." "</seg>

<seg id="522">"with the establishment of the four wind turbines, electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be met - this is roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="887">"up to now, migration covers 6,880 reported cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">"eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in further 25 cases Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was" possibly 18 years or older. ""</seg>
<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person" may be under 18 years old. "</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson on the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said of the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about its age.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending on European football clubs will not disturb Neymars Weltrekord-transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organisation supervising the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair-Play rules set up in 2011 by UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make the money loose with security so that Neymar will sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the wealthy family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but they must be counteracting with legitimate income sources which enable them to break the break-even point in their business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">"FFP was designed by Michel Platini, after his election to the UEFA president in 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken huge debts in their quest for success, cheat effectively and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP moved from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally purchased in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to build the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini fell from the presidency of the presidential election in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare off from excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP compared to The Associated Press last week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause from Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sum total for the next five years will be reported amounting to EUR 44.4 million in the financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 made the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (back then 82 million dollars), which later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overboard their financial view by inflating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsor should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the 2022 World Cup Organizing Committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatari 2022 are arguing that Neymar WM will be ambassador and can easily find such maneuvers for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive, try to avoid any attempt to bypass the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"the UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="1262">Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensifying pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the decision makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members in this month, as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflationary report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and forecast to 1.6% for 2018, and warned that inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signaled that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to curb the inflation of the Brexit and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package, which was issued a year after the Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for financial plan to provide cheaper financial means for banks from the coming February, although it is said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with CHF 115 billion."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central forecasting of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, since the pressure on the real income of households continues to be burdened by consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"the interest rates repeated, however, that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a" slightly greater "extent than markets."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that increases would be" "step-by-step" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">"the downward corrected growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9%, and 1.7% forecast in May."</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell to these news compared to the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision for no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations on a interest rate, and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to fall at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflationary report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and low levels of salaries, as the tightening is still worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy could not" prevent incomes from incomes "in the coming years, but she added that wages will recover at the end of their three-year forecast."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak Pound, which is compensated by a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU referendum that caused the fall of the Pact.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to complete the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the Bank's last ruling on interest rates, the call for interest rates rose as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households with three policy makers in July called for an increase to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Bank said that the exceeding in proportion to its goal of 2% is" "quite" "to the weak pound."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" "in view of the recent swap rate of swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive, as the lenders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way."</seg>

<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a pretext prophylaxis (prep) pretext prophylaxis, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial, after the Appeals Court confirmed last year a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep in spite of the assertion that the local authorities should finance him."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention", "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October 2018, before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prep prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who come into question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a primary doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local sex hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is awarded £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchase.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to evaluate the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, as is widely used, recorded and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, when targeted on vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that prep test medicine has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Shadows-Health Minister said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and reluctant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV infected, and that it will help to end the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne does not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely refurbished."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with an nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and an mezzanine level to make the generous ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"to this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlapping, so the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Fan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to mosquitos."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to insert the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored golden furniture, silver accents and vintage serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went there," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is object-important, so that when you push the door very easily slip."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property will be appreciated," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the size of the ground."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they succeeded in increasing the floor space and at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing due to good design and increased square meta of a little standard.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them."</seg>

<seg id="1357">"the former director of the Carlton-Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion about separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers acquired 38 real estates worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail shops."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul, has described as" main operator and the dominating personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the corporate estate and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A case of justice states that this means that Colin property has $316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the assessments proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now fight for control over the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, have excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affirmative vit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk-bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jewel shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"Colin says he began his career when he was" "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with their sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin asserts that Mark has paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars in leaving the company."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark were, Paul says," "the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter."</seg>
<seg id="1380">"Colin was very restrained, although he was a former AFL member of the board and after a biography from the year 2015, Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin responded by SMS to say" "I really can't say much" "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to disguise me and draw our family name through the dishes," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father had not wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," "he said, and added that he" still hope for a solution. ""</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our affair will be solved in the near future by the courts," Colin wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abstinence from the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive employees on his first working day, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wanted to fix: poor information coming into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame down Trump by overseeing his media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he had received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," said the former Electoral Accountant Sam Nunberg in February. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"at the time, Politicos Tara palmeri wrote that" the key to uphold Trumps Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Posts: 5204</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever was "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trumps tweets do not contain any more combustibles.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his associates have managed to keep away from it several times, their efforts have paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented gassle controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by promoting Trump Material that potentially promotes their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - very concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to give the president for strategic reasons, doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a vulcano to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he tends to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"that was what happened at the end of February, when someone complained to the president a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy commander Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for shkanes, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he has sold false accusations in the past and has revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Williams read the article and began asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump obtains. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counsellors still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1428">"some of the wealthiest landlords of the West Midlands are back with some determined travellers on the foot of the war, who have negotiated a trench from the community to claim a field in front of their mansions."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"the travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous road by Solihull, called the" Millionärs Series. ""</seg>
<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out in May without being deterred by a trench excavated by the Council to prevent their incursions."</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defensive systems and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"residents have urged the Council of Solihull, who said it was" useless to deal with the problem. ""</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous inhabitant said:" "they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones onto the passers."</seg>
<seg id="1434">The Council must be forced through shame to implement it as it was useless when dealing with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1435">The travellers were there in May and were moved on and are back again.</seg>
<seg id="1436">"more arrived yesterday evening, probably today more."</seg>
<seg id="1437">"she added:" "the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instruction to protect its parks."</seg>

<seg id="1439">"a natives who didn't want to be called said," It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers, just to be looted by another round. "</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is taken from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closing of the hotel Birkenhof through the then Ambiente of Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, about 30 000 nights spent per year lost and also income from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district, the hotel building was offered as an accommodation, which caused controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospective buyers in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"welcome to Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has long been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still a lot to do.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "cosmopolitan" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"you don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated downtown level, Scherer emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"both individual vacationists, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"Mr. Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause, he has already led, so shavers."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investment required, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to pinpoint exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the exterior installations are also brought to the fore, which is clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"a large terrace, which is open to the public, creates a patio in a courtyard."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affaires: us Special Investigator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, Sonderermittler Robert Mueller was said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the committee recorded the work in recent weeks, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "on appeal to persons familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper tasted the step as a sign that Mueller was widened and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN station reported that there were already first charges of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to be targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were negotiations between Trumps Electoral team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigation, several men are to face who acted as advisers to the republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the Sondererer Trump has personally moved into the centre and investigate whether the President possibly hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Juries is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called Ankle Chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to invite individuals to the company under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN transmitter, pre-loads have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, said it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps Consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former Electoral Director Paul Manafort were there."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the translation shows that Mueller does not shy away in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end, in order to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the overthrow of the Gremium was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of new revelations, the President on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia history is a total invention," Trump said. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme of the Democrats gives the democrats a possibility of" "feeling good" "because they have nothing else they can talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he would not know anything about setting a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"this work, however, is usually in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorses any action that hastened the work of the Sondererer on a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"the former FBI chief James Comey said three times, that it was not determined against the president."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"there is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this bulging, allegations against Trump have become loud, he has hindered the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to the presentation of US media, the White House gathered material against the special promoter and his staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent promoter of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later resigned president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired from the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"however, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented bills of legislation on Thursday, after which the offerer could no longer be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic ice mountain drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the Westantarctic, a gigantic ice mountain has been solved by the barely seven times of Berlin from the Schelfeis."</seg>
<seg id="1520">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the big colossus poured over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometer stretch now to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 miles of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for man from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"as far as climate change has played a role in the fall of the iceberg, research data is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual flaps in the region for some 30 years, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The split Koloss now has been part of the Larsen-C shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swim on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C shelf is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this dish, the balance of waxes and abruptions was disturbed some years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that even the Larsen-C Shelf file is in danger, as the front edge has never gone as far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the slab is under tension and can be disinfected if there is a piece of scrap on a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level, as it float on the water and pushes ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow more quickly than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only marginally, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI information, the Larsen-C Shelf is the fourth biggest hostage of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">It breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is conscious, the Eisschild now enters a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists is controversial whether the Larsen-C shelf should grow again or go back in the long run and possibly collapses, his colleague Adrian Luckman said:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in the past decades many ice-tufts of the Antarctic peninsula are falling apart."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature was attributable to the decline in temperature.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"in the past 50 years, the Antarctic peninsula has heated around three degrees and thus counts to the areas in which the temperature is the fastest stiff."</seg>

<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counter the future-oriented application shortages."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orientate itself both internally and externally, to show concrete measures for cross-entry and involve the CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is of a real "competition by the public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service of illness or age."</seg>
<seg id="1569">So it is time for action so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter peoples, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common proposal with his party."</seg>

<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level that is oriented to professional years."</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express himself to the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment," "said the organisation in a statement on the social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can assess all accusations that are currently raised, after we have collected all the information and assessing the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Jugend Rettet', the Isuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is presumed that its crew adopts tudinous migrants aboard, which can be delivered directly from traffickers and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting was allegedly only held 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's acts, whose contents were published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of imposing on the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats such as Isuventa must first have an Italian police officer, who oversees their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far been willing to stick to the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring any" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel Prize winner organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti said meanwhile that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting the efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"lookout points, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate Forest and the upstream levels."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there was repeatedely longer ascents, for the long Trials poppy."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again the lookout point to the viewpoint, connected by" flowige "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days there were again many altimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Do the sport stars in future sit in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through wind and weather over the stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high guests."</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first Bundesligavereine which are increasingly engaged in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and recently the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two pros for FIFA 17's computer game."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," that there are still some clubs to climb on this train. "</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend FIFA World Association organizes the first" "Interactive Club World Cup" "in London, where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Also Robin Dutt can see great potential in the e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be much more likely to be present on these markets by far more often than once a year to send the federal bond to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"computer games like" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or even the FIFA World Cup play FIFA on competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"they have long since established themselves as well as in normal sports, in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in Asia, E-Sport is already part of the official programme."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly used to get used to it."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has long been dealing with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can be found in classical sports, for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, cognitive abilities, technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fitte player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, Frobbing also sees problems:" doping becomes more and more a topic. ""</seg>

<seg id="1639">The scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are travelling internationally, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly about advertising, sponsoring and major tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to be 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"in contrast to the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga, this is not enough."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-Sport" is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "write the Deloitte consultants."</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are already many countries.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the football league matches, according to Dutt, are now obliged to set up an E-Sport department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany lags behind," says VfB CEO Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"only in nostalgia to decay, and to clarify the old times, is no longer enough."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"it is about keeping the association's tradition, but at the same time aligning the company on the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitalized world," says Dutt. "</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been abandoned."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced to life in June by Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is inconspicuous.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until calling.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter rose with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She ended his life in order to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has no regrets."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carters Attorney-at-Law said it was a" "terrible circumstance that they fully regret." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz however, he did not find out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">A public prosecutor read an explanation of Roys's mother Lynn Roy who said that there is "no day in which I don't feel the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I turn with everything. I try, in spite of all my pains that we will bear with us for eternity, for his sisters there." "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the knowledge that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or would be an aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer the only person I have been working with since my birth, is a pain that I will always be keeping with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent since there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to urge others to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case drew national attention to itself, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, leap from a building, get yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the eyes of his suicide, she wrote:" you have to do it, Conrad, "and" All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit by any press from the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"among the few who defended Carter owned Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in Italy for murder of her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago."</seg>

<seg id="1694">"the coach didn't announce it," told the Fed-Cup winner after his first deployment as Bayern captain. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"well, the level could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But the sign of the coach could be suggesting Kimi as well.</seg>

<seg id="1701">On Wednesday the 22-year-old flashed out as a mini-Lahm over the field.</seg>
<seg id="1702">"to the right, that is its position, the white binding on the arm did its rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all Kimi worked in this starting-formation like the one, who can best take the helm in his hand."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to steer the infiltrated troupe."</seg>

<seg id="1707">"after all, it worked very well."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"in addition to Kimi, Rudy ran off against the defenses, both acted confidently."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli-storm was often difficult, and Süßer was also trying to successfully tempt himself in the game-building a few times."</seg>

<seg id="1805">"the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slowdown of the evaporation from the ground, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to dryness."</seg>
<seg id="1806">The town of Geisha in the Thuringian Rhön is celebrating its 1200 years anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="1807">The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a middle age fest.</seg>
<seg id="1808">"Krämer, guilds, dealers, vagants or a land camp are to be seen in the city centre these days."</seg>
<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no respite from violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, ever since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 and until now, there have been at least seven dead in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her publisher and her inspirer of Rioodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, showing his smile face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder-Bundesanwalden was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has conducted only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders, which are linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, journalists are rarely charged by journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodova, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconspicuous and though the terrain is still more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little use, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we don't mistrust ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he just managed to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla had been stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" "twelfth". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the road every day or that the cemetery is full of complicated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Rioodoce, has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February, the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the sons, presumed gangsters bought each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to not compel Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, leaving the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as an experienced reporter in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Rioodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering a problem of narcotics, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and publicity increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Rioodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for their coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it hindered."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the job that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the riodoce team mixes Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse as a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love of routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their canny starting and landing flags," "to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the annoyance is, said the editor of the Rivoce Andres Villarreal, that" "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is done with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days before it became known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the scherz, some of the reporters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor himself designated as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Rioodoce licked three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending that focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled nearly the entire century all the political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped military assault."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers had seen Valdez's column as the best informed source about kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was relocated to the storage room for signs and stickers, protesting against the murders of journalists, because employees had become something they would never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the public prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials said, based on DNA tests that it is its."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder because they have written down in organized protests" SOS Press "on walkways and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is gone away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them kill them because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since asked that she is repartitioned by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"however, Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials, and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces who stuck with the organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"at Articulo 19, the media alarm group" Articulo 19 "has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Apparently the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo performed after the murder of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartelle with an editorial on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with high-risk choices."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admitted that drug trafficking startled him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to hell, and so I became a reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Rivoce were sitting at the sidewalk in front of the office and drinking beer, as suddenly all their phones began to hum."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with rival rivals and security forces near the spa of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued escalating as promised by a number of antitrust messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the onboard edge they have published the news on the website of Rioodoce on mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens flock nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the staff of Riodova followed his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day Javier was murdered, the trainees asked me to send them for reporting on the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight, it looks like a statue, though a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible Nashort of a Canadian mining worker have been preserved so well that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so good that they could even find that its flaky skin was of reddish brown - and they said it would have had something of a" "troubled past." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in" Current Biology "described him as" the guarded armoured dinosaur, ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well preserved condition has astonished scientists, which describe it as" really remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met on something that seemed out of the surrounding rock on the board, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best received dinosaur specimens, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that these herbivores, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing shell, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterweight, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to interfere with its surroundings better and to avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaurs family has made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli following the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the astonishing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armour over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaur has been hunted by enough pressure through eating carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter shadowing - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot, which signalizes that this nodose-carrier was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores must have been of the Cretaceous period," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to study the animal on evidence of his life, including its preserved intestine, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs when he died, fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as southern flourishes today, and rivers and oceans probably farther farther farther than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosaurs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preservative flaky skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the beast," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you have just a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, passed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaurs was hunted by some of his fearful ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the guarded armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that rained from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant-eater was swept through the western Canada until a flooded flow floods into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater refunds of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the Haubarley still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a winning lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I watch it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1976">"on the exact number of the injured, no details will initially be given."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was a light to medium-weight injury, said a police officer."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing is stuck in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepening into his work and has just an ingenious thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: pufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">"comes the conductor and wakes an unsushing, or sweeps the passenger in the middle of the workflow."</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and validate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test operation is running on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer depends, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available in many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," "said a railway speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in," the train calls the ticket devaluation without the conductor. "</seg>
<seg id="1999">"to be able to use it, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which already do most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you must also have purchased the app from the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" "comfort check-in" "works like that: one climbs into the train, calls his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"with the test customers, a button for electronic devaluation appears."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"the train companion when ticket inspections goes to No. Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep quiet."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn is to use passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you prefer to travel without ticket inspections by our train crew, check out the DB Navigator software."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal," says Michael Peterson, DB's marketing management board. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">"second Plus:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"who often goes by train, knows that in addition to delays and missed moves, ticket inspections are among the greatest offences."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for many times, however, one of the passengers does not have all the documentation needed for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"either the credit card or ID card is missing, or otherwise a document you have to assign."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger, leading to bad mood in part or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2024">"confused, as no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly savied on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., to tweet live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Date: 06 / 14 / 2009 Size:</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She removed her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets on people at the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" Fergusons police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman took his gun and shouted," "I'm going to kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell reminded her of her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11 o'clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and power, which consists of the people's point of view, who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two talked a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it with me," said Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and it must be seen and raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we have to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is not different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after August 9," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell passed Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said that she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by innumerable cases of men, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the former Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his engagement brought the project nearer to Ferrell, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Brown's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that in the movement" not a messiah leader, but about a community coming together, "Folayan said - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents from" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrells's life as she falls in love with her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the incarnation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who, following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin, have marked the film" BlackLivesMatter "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement is truly held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, she insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence although it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the police stations in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that it calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clings herself to a song and she feels committed to that memory since she went to Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian precinct split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The subject hardly leaves the issue cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The subject is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say," This would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" This would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't you need a person "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while proponents are building that a gallery draws more customers into the city, including the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian precinct is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct marketing markets offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be an end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery owners want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlords were always happy again and again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher's shop was discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities this is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small markthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery is located, comes to the amount of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this might not be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Rezension: Ian McEwan: "sweet Tooth"</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think this is superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, stores are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the rental shops there are often not traceable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"sorry, special shops are almost no longer available and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a Markthalle didn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market hall be in the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery actually arrives.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghost bit gallery before selling all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that is empty doesn't need any.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the unbelievably many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly identical - which hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarseggen that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after secretly classified diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks site.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is named A Becoming resemblance."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has united its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his post."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, a sharp, though some intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already talked openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison their image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg passed straight from the great success of its 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, by extracted the DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal British friends who exchanged several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, predicted a future in which the President would convert the verdict in person and would be able to see the exhibition in person. "</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome sort of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to continue to inflame the rigid circuits that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things are going to happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"Manning asked in an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery (the" i "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of" automatic dispersion, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg wanted to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in the biological view, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome is not responsible for who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, are also visible. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she emerges with a free speech in hand from the Disciplines of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put up your speech, then they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets out of Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the space by the masks, from their own genomic simulacles, which gather together like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which their genetical haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg of portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who was searched as suspects after a man had been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Cook County Regional Court."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>

<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead in the scene of the action, and detectives investigating the engravings as murder while the police actively sought after the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubase, vice-president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem may now be in certified and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus."</seg>
<seg id="2167">This is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>

<seg id="2170">"the statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked, wanting to stand up."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he requested the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>

<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza, who had just received a mysterious tip, said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi. "</seg>

<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria listed in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the approval approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on state-sponsored doping in the Russian sport."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in relation to the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation, because our anti-doping system has made a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>

<seg id="2193">"in conversation with Russian sales point rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added:" "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the WADA as part of the Doping scandal in Russia."</seg>

<seg id="2261">Some have pulled out their jersey units and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team these inactive minutes are a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center on the next morning.</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of the players, and it has lengthened their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 to meet the already fully packed schedule of players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day, at which the Bruges shifted the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time while Moras performed six times in Westwood practical exercises."</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has lived 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat at the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>

<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England spanned the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Steewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter, which was written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the installed hyena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care, gardening and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" whiskey and started writing. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go all the way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that appeared in 1380 in the castle, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says. "</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasant revolt started in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start.</seg>

<seg id="2314">"other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patrons that the Darrell family hidden during the English reformation seven years."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed out of the 18th century, which filled his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery which was only completed years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney:" gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always make debt and spend money for things they couldn't afford. "</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell-men solved their debt crisis by marrying out rich old wives - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise their landlady."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique write experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has brought a two-week stay in Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the area of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the clincher of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 persons, who are supposed to have been directly involved in the attempted coup attempt, this week in Ankara is negotiated."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan described the attempt to overthrow the" "God's present" "as he had given him the opportunity to fully cleanse the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Unhairy in Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the general staff, there are concerns about an increasing" Islamianization "of the army which, among other things, manifesting itself in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The major coach in the army and the security forces goes on.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in the middle of July Erdogan suffered further 7395 heads of state, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they stimulated their role as guardians of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his victory in 2002, Erdogan overthrew the power of the military step by step, not least on appeal to the reform proposals of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is targeting an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "a named officer, who sought asylum after the coup attempt in fear of persecution in foreign countries, warned the Turkish army in a few years" full of extremists and Salafists. ""</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots comes."</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are a big thing at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotik) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently," Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpulls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also" "adapt" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a progressive woman progressively."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpulators have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for instance, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they look appealing, such as shyshness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," enthuses the True Companion website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, it also has its moods - like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" in mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the submissive female qualities, the allusions to rape if one walks a step on Frigid (i.e.: contradictory) Farrah, quit one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have any Roxxxy?" "it says on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing refinement indicate somewhat darker and deeper in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what leaks out of the periphery, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots face in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boiled to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') are not the graphic pictures, the devoured body and the pierced eyes, but how realistically this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personalities, "robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that points to independence or anything, which might disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are counterfeit slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Redemption of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">"it has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions, which have polarised the US electorate, have also split families in small format."</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the United States with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all purported ourselves to let our filter bubbles burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">"less noticeable is the power of Trumps, to bring families together."</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a left-directed breeder who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, anyone who knows it, including the republican relationship with which it had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is important to me that this entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the decreasing effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" "normalization" "and" "Trump", "we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens will no longer be thrown away."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing" normalized "which suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urborian version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump actually occurred as a very mild offence."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally fit to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the Carousel of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are cracking and the animals are twisting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clipping music conveys this in a strange way."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate may help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA and in the UK 300,000 causes gastric cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol, to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance conducive immune cell occurs in mice with a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"it suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet tolerant of tryptophan enhances a tolerant, less inflammatory bowel movement if the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan looked for a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was however housed separately, had not had this."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells but lacked them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were obtained by L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria looked at the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transmitted small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleansed from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanes were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells such as mice and that most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote since these cells control inflammations on the intestines's internal surface. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially high tryptophanes in the presence of L. reuteri, can lead to an expansion of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production in the last month costs taxpayers according to the military personnel left to the TIME Magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and executive officer of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"manufactured in Connecticut, helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his supervisor, deputy naval commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long until the turf was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed due to the limitation of the working hours a second team would need for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight number was at the helicopter during the event, while the security staff remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the recordings provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could violate the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," "answered the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to reform of health reform underway in the Senate and propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But their use only for a photo-operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February Trump completed an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in front of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages that complained about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is thrilled by the show" "Made In America" "- the products from all over 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials," said the deputy press secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to suspend US president in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"as a rough start at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings at the White House in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for" "Made in America" "event counted for the training needs of the flight number for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopters also flew 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential Supporting missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers took charge of none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budgetary designations for the presidential paragraphs, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the US Department of Defense for the budget year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Unit Records recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," said Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things this week, which are manufactured in America," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to emphasize that."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fireman car."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and shouted with the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>

<seg id="2894">"on the other hand, the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that the report on violence was measured with" two measurements. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in respect of the encroachments in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is" shameful and shameful acts "to be punished and prevented in the future; but striking is the" degree of media manipulation "," writes the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "you're welcome to go to the church and this is a found fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that" "strokes have been a very normal educational tool" "in her youth," "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they found it unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports of abuse, pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorabilia" "My brother of the Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take the protection of Georg Ratzinger," "says Hesemann," "because all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with Enlightenment recognised by the lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"altogether 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "with high plausibility" "victims of attacks, 67 domain cats."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was even more severe."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other complaining, many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen was relieved by Georg Ratzinger in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence covering violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many disciples highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who became palpable by the economist when a Domspatz musically produced no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as your biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you do the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight pages dedicated and it is clearly revealed by any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the acts of violence at the preschool occured beyond its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"one can at best reproach him, to get out of it too late or to have taken first hints seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the high school gymnasium on which he worked, was perceived as literally" "salvation", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"in this way, the broad majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also provides an excellent testimony," "sincere", "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere "and" honest "teacher who provided the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always lagged by children's grapes. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and high emotionality, which also led to quarries."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only pop up with chairs and threw the muzzle on the floor, but also put ear-feigned and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself had already given him years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for this."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I too have experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, that is certainly Bagatellen."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders if it is not more concerned with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just collapsed on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who never understood him are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media in connection with the report a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen was reported in the media.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger put in the final report any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted to the cathedral capella.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said a victim of the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in the education of sexual abuse, however, is that most of the victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the rate of the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insight and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it is reckoned to him... Buben unobtrusive or clear or even more open than against their parents, dormitories, confidence teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... is unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"concerning sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of any co-author."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to link his good name to these vile crimes, as it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media much of "acts of violence" were to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former cathedral-master Georg Ratzinger was charged in the report" "Wegvisor". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and anywhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"clearly separated: between the pre-school and the high school of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other reproaches."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were quite layered and enforcaged, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have prevailed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with the cathedral-master Georg Ratzinger, because he didn't get the boys to face when they were already at the domain gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, as most witnesses emphasise, the theme" preschool "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even" "paradise". ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline already, but there was no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even bring positive memories to it despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at most, the accusation remains to have looked."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut down the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the high school gymnasium that the report was actually reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out this," that in the pre-school the test penalty will continue to be practised. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test penalties were banned in Bavaria too long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before this, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate, where those affected might be overdone or dramatised and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one cannot say that he had always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis affirmed that it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we have been talking about" Fallstrick of Anachronism, "i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that then."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I am happy that it will finally be worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take the protection of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. pinnackles and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, it also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger given in conversations with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of examiner also available for speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVI., tells from his perspective, since the cathedral-cats only played a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I didn't deny that he was there a strict regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly be possible for him to form a cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone you don't even make a great singer and before every success, just in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work in the book and beyond, I experienced Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, deep-tempered, deeply believer and heart-good people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could only do a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly receive regular contact with him, like many former domain cats, 23 years after his embodiment, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was stern to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most of the domain cats are thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good father, a strict father, certainly that might be - but also a lovely respectable person, to which they still look up today and to revere them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all you have accused of are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make a scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that stands behind, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the proprieties tend to have a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits, and probably none of Germany would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
