Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I always put in drawers
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star un@@ ambig@@ uous in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously .
I always put in drawers or stuck from outside label stuck with me and the reality mostly little .
I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are more sn@@ app@@ y to me . &quot;
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her as Miss Perfect as she explains in the current cosm@@ opol@@ itan .
&quot; the act@@ ress is most likely to spend her time at home , in front of a television with delicious d@@ utch and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child &apos;s Play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs on us from August 25th .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sports Pyram@@ id
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues searched for a little variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses rec@@ alled their holidays , they hun@@ ted at the fast g@@ allo@@ p home to the fe@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and that ended the riding career as well .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament vic@@ tories - back in the vicinity of horses . &quot;
&quot; he left with his family about the installation of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even s@@ wear for photo . &quot;
the first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid provided the man from An@@ hausen in a small g@@ ala the Golden Sports Pyram@@ id .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
Good@@ wood Revi@@ val - 13 - 15 September 2013
even the British Queen has already ad@@ mi@@ red him .
the 18th winner of the Sports Pyram@@ id is a long one .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting junior talent for decades .
and so he gave the prize money of 25.000 Euros the same .
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master &apos;s winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ eng , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ eh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports legends were coming to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illu@@ stri@@ ous society wander@@ ed to the show stadium where the Lav@@ azza price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; the two US presidential candidates , however , are at the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tr@@ ump does not want to remain small in doubt and war@@ ns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he would be quite different , asser@@ ted Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely withdraw regulations , and he makes himself strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain duties , he has privileged opportunities to open up and needs money . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , taxes would be increased for the rich , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost immediately . &quot;
the Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
government investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical wing of the Republi@@ can Party .
so on Tr@@ ump there might be party internal discussions .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policy .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and re @-@ drive the coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce it . &quot;
&quot; with its investment programme , Clinton specifically wants to expand the renewable energy and demands : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the d@@ spa@@ zi@@ ffer trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of us do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , demands about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , &quot; &quot; The minimum wage must rise , then he says that he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics guard him , so that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
&quot; escape : &quot; &quot; every escaped woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is a part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has placed her little son in her arms .
he looked curious into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until it not@@ ices that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene appears normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs created the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman arriving here has experience with sexual violence during her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families are sending them as hope @-@ bear@@ ers to Europe , &quot; she says . &quot;
women out@@ weigh other reasons for the flight : &quot; many steal away secre@@ tly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , volunteers , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , are mistaken , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in worst case . &quot;
&quot; this results in the fact that about 90 per cent of women who live in the North of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children have certainly not come up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are accu@@ stom@@ ed to say that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experienced , because shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodations just for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether or not they knew from a similar project like in Munich , they answer no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Palat@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , escaped women are not housed separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower Saxony and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are some common shel@@ fs or houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be shel@@ tered from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are being shel@@ ved separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing , or if men and women are accommod@@ ated , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible for women , is included in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel about this need of protection can be seen at the rush , which gives it to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily set up a second house .
assistant sts : demands for new work combat measures
dep@@ u@@ ties of the assist@@ ants have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new work of work in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work of work from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC declared that ministers would have failed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract .
assistance and medical students have voted in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to issues , which led to the refusal of the treaty . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Bureau has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and calls for official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Bureau today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work combat measures starting at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistance for assistance in this year was six sm@@ al , the first complete out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the B@@ MA assist@@ ants , Dr. Johann Mal@@ a@@ a@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for physicians in England would be mandatory . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot for@@ bid the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be nar@@ rower and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly from his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report full of five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even be improved . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper compl@@ ained that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened . &quot;
his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first one mentioned in its introduc@@ tory words : the down@@ turn of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to time was kind@@ led .
Putin dismis@@ sed and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia .
&quot; the off@@ ence was even greater , since it was committed by a put@@ ative friend . &quot;
re@@ building the confidence will become difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the controlled media controlled a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks bear the blame for everything .
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations from leading officials that Erdo@@ gan would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could hire a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan is primarily needed for all friends he can get after he was given nearly his ministry last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
this week the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; a report in Ve@@ gh@@ ost@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , as it considers its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the continued gru@@ dge over the snail &apos;s pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ p@@ pled to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus for the fact that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he called for support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this gl@@ amor@@ ous palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y the &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described , &quot; two countries that are exp@@ elled from the West and feel poor@@ ly treated and are now alli@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both the pres@@ idents at the press conference said they did not even seize the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey inten@@ tionally avoided a question of their differences , while Putin decided to acc@@ entu@@ ate them . &quot;
there is no clear consensus about where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will at least talk to one another . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced himself since it had to be collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; in this period , br@@ anded strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer fin@@ anz@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national stamps into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head office and the stock exchange are transferred to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for retail , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors brand and the brand under which our employees are busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these trademarks will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these trademarks with our customers .
R@@ BS has already announced that his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer continue and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the chief of the board . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these stamps . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;

Russian Putin regi@@ sters Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of Putin &apos;s nar@@ ro@@ west vote of confidence .

&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration without stating reasons . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was vice @-@ president since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo emb@@ assy . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief of the staff and staff of the government personnel . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as head of government with regard to bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow secre@@ tive .
&quot; for a long time , Sergei Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Putin and worked as he worked for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff would withdraw from his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is there the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at present .
&quot; but the official claim , that a man who once was praised as a potential president , suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin referring to the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated item - you could almost say - embarrass@@ ing post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the position in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin was a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;

ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in Ban@@ ff garden
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there are 75 f@@ ishings related to San@@ da@@ al that were mir@@ r@@ ored by a fountain .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 obli@@ que ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown today paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witn@@ essing an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tri@@ cky activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the entire bridge deck at its place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete base today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first cl@@ asp is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high @-@ pressure and civil engineering .
&quot; after the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the northern tower deck located in the extension , we had to close the existing gap on the north or south side . &quot;
&quot; this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge , 700 milli@@ meters south . &quot;
this was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; since the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , they were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
&quot; rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re r@@ n@@ li rescue station made an alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved out of their own power . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a boat without life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men thrown into the water have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; although the boat had an emergency stop , the boat was loos@@ ened by the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has now wo@@ ke up over these men today .
seriously injured - man suff@@ ers from his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police reported yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alco@@ ho@@ z@@ ine dis@@ si@@ p@@ ates the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
she then al@@ armed her sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her companion .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old sho@@ ok his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens think : investors should in future be put into duty much more strongly in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 favour@@ ably cheap apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; room concept living &quot; at the next council meeting .
but contro@@ vers@@ y is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president Christoph Brat@@ mann comments : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the big contro@@ vers@@ y in the town hall is , however , as viol@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing construction program , which will cost millions of dollars , should be paid for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so viol@@ ently : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CDU wishes to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er runs for investors .
&quot; not@@ with@@ standing , as viol@@ mann , there is an intensi@@ fication of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; the programme does not yet fully exist : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how does one compare the loss of other 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments whose funding will run over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
because in the West city the year @-@ end dead@@ lines are running out .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; the number of social housing in the West city is dras@@ tically increased , from the objective of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged parts in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; s &amp; D vice @-@ president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke believes : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU has to go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they have been concentr@@ ating on more building plots for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
&quot; teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time on star@@ ing on screens , has been compl@@ ained by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the television , then vide@@ og@@ ames and finally on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later they created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game has resulted in a significant increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person lays back every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch who pursu@@ es 3@@ 5,000 users , shared the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of tra@@ ced people practicing every day 30 minutes , 45 percent were le@@ aping to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take about 30 minutes to come &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active each day &quot; &quot; on de@@ af ears , because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look el@@ usi@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; those who regularly drive sports , reduces their chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here . &quot;
&quot; the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people even include new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always there are also sul@@ len bac@@ kl@@ ets , which have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
a breakthrough happened .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will take time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and will help many people hunting , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the belt
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the ground .
brilliant on a full line .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast died on Thursday for the multi @-@ combat title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
&quot; her total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es will perform at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ combat title and overall the fifth , while she soli@@ di@@ fies her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 World Championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected her last check in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas will be considered a dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the art gym@@ nas@@ tics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; it took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the f@@ arewell party of the team coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long run to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
a part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gym@@ nasi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost a multi @-@ competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak series that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Must@@ af@@ ina led slightly through two twi@@ sts , the picture dec@@ ei@@ ves . &quot;
Swedish beams and floor sur@@ geons - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ tered .
&quot; she picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her end @-@ b@@ able - a mere form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became a reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , called &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercise , she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ eba to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Hor@@ ror Story )
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed , who had been killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series mur@@ der@@ ous attack by Phoenix , while staying in the car and listening to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle &apos;s Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire weapon , while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the triple murder might not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who belonged to one of the adult victims . &quot;

&quot; in total , seven people were killed in his@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months , and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles including a brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same killer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to its injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting that crashed on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a bul@@ let out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his retirement , Ed@@ mund Stan@@ ek has known the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t . &quot;
I don &apos;t like it .
I did not let myself alone .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund can never recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a side@@ walk .
&quot; Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cra@@ wl up to his third year of life , and he still cannot speak . &quot;
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run and cycle with support .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has conceived for &quot; Please sing me something before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented a few signs alone .
&quot; micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic , as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the zig@@ z@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds you of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I constantly ask , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis again for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect someone to really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; violent ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ scale flo@@ ods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their shores and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards reported that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the governor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased . &quot;
ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a would have requested tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service showed that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in this area in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flo@@ od@@ gate system was used on Friday , while in the area of Mobile continued to rain . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood a lot of houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream in@@ undation of Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , since they are slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the flo@@ ods . &quot;
&quot; the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , arrived on Friday at 0@@ 9.00 the highest level ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still ski@@ pped people from flood water in the areas of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strong overnight . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives nearby , had warned him . &quot;
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water poured out and poured in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years , where she lived there , never seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were staying until Friday .
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had &quot; &quot; spread rapidly &quot; &quot; since there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil has been considerably su@@ cked by ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities admitted that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and flo@@ ods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and a breakdown of school in five school districts .
the C@@ BS &apos;s WW@@ L subsidiary reported that an ordered two @-@ person in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 floo@@ ded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both floo@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets , washed by flo@@ ods . &quot;
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond emergency measures were set up to lodge the evacu@@ ated .
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to flood water and sand bags were provided for the residents , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison &apos;s count@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported as floo@@ ded , but on Friday they were not reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; perfor@@ ated by spheres , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents admitted that brown had suffered several injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm , and belly , but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was perme@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores gave to the broad@@ ca@@ ster . &quot;
I just cannot believe that .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy informed the broad@@ ca@@ ster that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it seemed to be a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , t@@ aps the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this was clearly a constant struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the road , were seals . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have been several armed comb@@ at@@ ants involved , who were very actively involved , &quot; shared police man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
&quot; there was no ar@@ rests and police inspec@@ tions , according to reports , report@@ edly checked the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ ra@@ cket on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police still search for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been in every summer olymp@@ i@@ ad since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian who is Catholic , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic @-@ female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an American American . &quot;
Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were last year .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising , Olympic winner and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three @-@ fold world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they provided unexpected , yet master@@ ful grammar routine . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone became the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ competition event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see gym@@ nas@@ tics throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to make it into the olymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ ning is an expensive sport and is primarily driven by private trainers who are maintained by parents who are maintained for training , training , travel and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these gym@@ nas@@ tics are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the gym@@ nas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to inspire the communities of au@@ n countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easily accessible exercise training . &quot;
I founded my gym of 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gym@@ nas@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and his@@ panic ) , and national and international winners are trained . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gym@@ nas@@ tics , which make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gym@@ nas@@ tics and that is great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance sts want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assist@@ ants voted for a vote rejected him . &quot;
Hun@@ t had un@@ v@@ eiling her plans in July and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
&quot; the first assistance services are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to bed@@ time and weekend dar@@ s to improve the care for early watch times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA committee for assist@@ ants announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance for the proposed contract , particularly , that it will heat up the current workforce and will admini@@ ster it to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time is running out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to solve the disputes through talks have joined the government for rel@@ uc@@ tance to take part and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; that happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done about it last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now to raise the up@@ swing and address the concerns of the assist@@ ants .
&quot; if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work combat measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to grant physicians on the Stri@@ ke chain cover . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants a better week of the week for the 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , CEO of the N@@ HS staff , called for the assistance to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work combat measures do not achieve anything of the only little but strain reli@@ ed teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only concerns , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the past two months , we have spoken to the Committee of Assi@@ sts and responded positively to concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wings with the Ministry of Health as well as other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who returned from a vocational training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the Ministry of Health in terms of compl@@ ying with the agreements with B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons suffering from heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack . &quot;
the NI@@ CE regulation of the N@@ HS has recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the NI@@ CE regulation of the N@@ HS has recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the surface breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dissolved , it can flow through the blood stream and blocked the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another risk .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely . &quot;
&quot; the study of NI@@ CE , which was published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of NI@@ CE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; with a preliminary recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years .

the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ision has led to the fact that widespread elections in Muslim communities are ignor@@ antly ignored as a devastating governance report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les interven@@ es verb@@ ally the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ s to have ignored evidence of mis@@ use due to &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al Government , who is now a slave @-@ king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside of elec@@ toral bodies to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should have a hint with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er merely needs to name his name and address . &quot;
the report proposes not to apply removable ink to the finger of a person if they give up their elec@@ tive voice to prevent someone to vote twice .
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to church records and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only aimed at election fraud , but should also protect the municipal government against the wider corruption and financial fraud that comes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special elec@@ toral Tribunal decided that the Mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be ab@@ used after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court ruled that &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal ways &quot; &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations . &quot;
Rah@@ man is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him .
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation in which one person chose as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ arm@@ ingly to the dec@@ eit@@ ful letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the leadership of instruc@@ tors to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; as evidence , pressure has been exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or Banglad@@ es@@ hi backgrounds . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have unk@@ now@@ ingly ignored this behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean@@ se the system , including the ban that political activists work brief@@ ing documents to stop &quot; re@@ aps . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires harder registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
&quot; do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has released her voice , to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic stamp .
ban that political activists work full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes from mail@@ ings .

photography prohibited in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees generally asser@@ t that voters go to the elec@@ toral cabin themselves .
&quot; Sir Eric runs through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets has been no criminal complaint . &quot;
&quot; the election tri@@ bunal has explained Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty on the basis of the high requirements of the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check @-@ out controls &quot; of the election registration departments of the town hall .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spreading of election fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities men@@ ace this good reputation . &quot;
mad after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come across the French cycling team Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T in addition to the edge and the band that proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic &quot; &quot; Olympic &quot; &quot; is by far not the only gold @-@ fighting ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if one is allowed to believe in social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s most famous . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; except K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the track , many people on the Internet pointed out how to be a certain bow cap of the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
the team member of the US team in the bow shooting Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star sc@@ ary alike .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy shared the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking fellow , so I do this as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ female singer for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison . &quot;
one gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor .
&quot; another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who shows similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face @-@ shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the simil@@ arities as well .
&quot; theory into space : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in the gym@@ nas@@ tics Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own wonderful , wide smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry it happened . &quot;
&quot; at the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the people who had answered the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter for more than 90 times . &quot;

&quot; C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users , compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments &quot;
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .

&quot; B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olympic course , he said . &quot;
&quot; I was referring to the performance of the float , not to them as a person . &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who tried sham@@ eless under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked as she looked at it , drag@@ ged her out and put her back to the shelf . &quot;
they continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before placing her back on the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of pants from the out@@ lay , drag@@ ged her own ti@@ ghts and pants and ta@@ sted her . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Oskar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same thing with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , and went up and went out . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching someone - or thinking about the person who might under circumstances buy the under@@ pants she had tried .
&quot; Mr Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting that someone would take home pants who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to draw clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of pants and find out that another woman hated her and pulled out and she wasn &apos;t washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question have been with@@ drawn from the sale .
how to Prot@@ ect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against arms
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you .
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to spin the sk@@ e@@ wer for your rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; if you are approached from behind , you should turn around first so that you can see your attack@@ er and move from the fir@@ ing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit the face with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with his knees in the chest and twist while the aggres@@ sor is cro@@ oked before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the gun on it . &quot;
&quot; for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the fir@@ ing line , grab the gun and twist it , so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; shift the weight onto the weapon at the same time and hit the attack@@ er on your chest , then flip the gun from its grip before moving backwards and the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
take a look at the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y , it is saf@@ est to submit your money - unless you are not a Grand@@ master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide@@ book his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex a serious test - by making some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k crashed his train on a Euro ticket , a ban@@ ker at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a spre@@ ader of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; in front of the le@@ aking of each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is getting into . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought to le@@ ak the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a tensi@@ le toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left that he li@@ cked out more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his gut by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public money to train stations to flus@@ hing of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely below a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud @-@ water . &quot;
in the film he was definitely justified in his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample @-@ painting showed a lumin@@ ometer population of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometer quantity of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to le@@ ak after its lumin@@ ometer population was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I got in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not dock here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o .

&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ hafts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in color@@ ec@@ tal cancer is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direction , added : &quot; let me say so - I lost my respect for Ian , if he had some of the things I had told him to lick , just like the ec@@ el@@ ly Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to dock , and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said they should at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; social family destro@@ ys the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation of social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cious family left her social home after a del@@ u@@ ge with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terror@@ ised her neigh@@ bors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls showed plain@@ tive holes , wooden boards were torn up , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation .
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for home management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I believe people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who were living in the apartment meanwhile , and the police said that the terror that the family had added , sei@@ zur@@ es of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive cri@@ es , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; there were drugs dealt with in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floors torn &quot;
neigh@@ bors said they had to fight them on the streets and perio@@ dic@@ ally had to be inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ o@@ gi@@ ated her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ u@@ ction were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neigh@@ bors who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They were not interested in anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager von Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have failed to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called up at regular intervals , for 20 years . &quot;
gar@@ bage and old toys were dump@@ ed on the crowded part of the village house
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant des@@ ist to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family since a del@@ o@@ gi@@ cation is always the last step taken by Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horri@@ ble .
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ a@@ geous toward us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and con@@ veys the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was awarded a fine after having found guilty of the owner of a class B drug in trade @-@ sec@@ rec@@ y .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in 2013 in a car accident .
&quot; having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will arrange ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela c@@ row from the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police reported that the del@@ o@@ ding was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without repro@@ aches and those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal panic after a ti@@ charged military jet flies
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ guese model P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane of the air forces put an unbelievable fall flight
&quot; the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no safety risk &quot;
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists are starting to panic after a jet @-@ powered Jet sink over a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ots showed how the military aircraft flew close to the sun @-@ refu@@ ges on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle works , without first seeing what came through the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep two times and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ yo added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast , and so deep flying that this was the only way to see them . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said that due to the bad visibility conditions in the vicinity , the air@@ strip flew slightly deeper than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with four people from Madeira to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which limits his sight . &quot;
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot;

&quot; the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , thereby clari@@ fying the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the benefit of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen trade fairs in Barcelona have been the number one for two years now .
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique thus ren@@ ounced a clear decision in this respect and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er Ste@@ gen had the priority in most other applications . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; also at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ par@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convincing . &quot;

Ma Long in a private league with table tennis
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis tournament winner .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , the first ranked player first awarded the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at WM , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the end game and made the title one another .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would pick the single title in the mark of the Five rings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ Min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time outs they had no c@@ aches . &quot;
they had pulled back on the grand@@ stands and left their prot@@ ectors at a fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches to this place I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang concluded . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts pos@@ ing with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
&quot; after that , he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected thr@@ illing match .
&quot; nevertheless , there were enough breath @-@ taking air changes to be seen . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump explo@@ des ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative federal states to lose their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident multi @-@ militar@@ ist expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race within the own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House now grow . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians he asked for support in major states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; blame were false reports on his candid@@ acy , he again took up his well @-@ known media sho@@ vel . &quot;
Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by sur@@ vey@@ ors from June , Tr@@ ump and his bank@@ rupt@@ cy from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump though in front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also endangered as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and sh@@ it afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than telling the truth .
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for political correctness , it is al@@ right , Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press reports , the party Tr@@ ump is supposed to have threatened to submit funds to support his elec@@ toral campaign , he should not present better results . &quot;
instead of that one wants to push the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans more under the arms of Congress .
Olympic : third st sc@@ am with dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; after a recru@@ itment test in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee was promptly advised to establish a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village gave a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 3 ( Southern Europe ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 5 ( Cyr@@ il@@ lic ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 6 @-@ i ( Arabic )
the IA@@ AF World Association has requested the IO@@ C to obtain information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and went out as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , released and signed the test , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ creditation of the athletes who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in 2015 in Peking World Cup fourth .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics . &quot;
he is said to have informed about upcoming D@@ oping tests against cash inf@@ lows of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he report@@ edly was arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport . &quot;
&quot; after numerous dop@@ ing trials , Kenya has been under special observation for a long time . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls published by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Olympics , it was un@@ usually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic beginning .
&quot; as a consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Peking .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , there were always alle@@ g@@ ations that dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a substantial ment@@ ality of sports fraud . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und last asked for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had indicated in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it was possible to prove that in this kind of sport was widespread and systematically sub@@ du@@ ed . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
&quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth mare .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ stav@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix and the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
she rec@@ alls with melanch@@ oly to her friendship with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there is Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
she is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli back the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as conclusi@@ ve today as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e &apos;s lawyer said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ packed country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school@@ girls from the east of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sult@@ anas family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .

&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton will nom@@ inate the Jud@@ ge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked the country &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; &quot; gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for Rei@@ d said later that he had not spoken to Clinton , whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the U.S. App@@ ell@@ ation Court for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , be mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidates Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his naked magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys is distingu@@ is@@ hable since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the opinion that the Calendar also does .
&quot; we need to return to depic@@ ting timeless and classic hair@@ lessness where both women and men feel at ease and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the release of Kal@@ en@@ dar@@ s . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person at open cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .

&quot; in the short term , the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany expects ten thousands of def@@ enders from Turkey to flee to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even &quot; become &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; believes the leader of the alliance Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh action of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with several hundred thousand prot@@ esters from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already crossed Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds in months ago with sanctions , 500,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the icy put@@ sch , even secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks would be added . &quot;
many will want to re @-@ start in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , who is taking refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of Foreign Affairs compl@@ ained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been era@@ dic@@ ated or driven out over the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said , who is also a CDU member . &quot;
&quot; the government said that the Federal Government is &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics .
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .

&quot; as the newspaper reported on appeal to the figures of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turkish authorities in front of the coup plot@@ ted the biggest group of asylum justified in Germany for political persecution . &quot;
&quot; at the end of June 30th , this was 11,@@ 386 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all of them had been eligible for asylum ( 39,@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey there are no prisoners of war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : where to go where it hur@@ ts
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament decided already at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the candidates are on vacation .
&quot; most of the holi@@ day@@ makers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , spread ballo@@ ons , spread fl@@ yers and en@@ um@@ er@@ ate them in the end , only work lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; up to 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let the people pass over themselves once even in the election campaign . &quot;
the hot phase when one can say that at all has just begun .
Windows @-@ 12@@ 54 ( Turkish ) windows @-@ 12@@ 55 ( Hebrew ) windows @-@ 12@@ 56 ( Arabic )
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU . &quot;
what is exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition air .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous campaign for election . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , spread ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , as it did his legendary word@@ less predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel to blame for the blo@@ oming of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We create &quot; have spe@@ eded up the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CDU with her leading candidate , the Minister of Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when at the wrong time at the right place elec@@ toral campaigns . &quot;
she has invited Angela Merkel twice as Chancellor Angela Merkel . Merkel &apos;s parliamentary elections lies in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it is also a shame to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CDU ren@@ oun@@ ces largely to the usual campaign conditions on market@@ places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that , in the country , it crum@@ bles the basis that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely present in the vast expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CDU voters Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is much on the game , Sell@@ ering called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind CDU ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
in the election of 2011 the SPD won by 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CDU ( 22 ) .
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in surveys , should make the leap into the country day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and spend their election campaign largely on the internet .

&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the leading candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hou@@ seb@@ o@@ at through the Mecklenburg L@@ akes and also finds it beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ref@@ ur@@ b@@ ishment : inn@@ s suffer from block@@ age
&quot; the speed with which the B 27 is re@@ developed , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is always praise . &quot;
&quot; they have made everything pretty jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gasoline station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the weekend , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; praised is also the proceeds of those responsible for building work , for example when it comes to setting up accommodation . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the block of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was abol@@ ished , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again exists , the traffic situation within the place relax@@ es . &quot;
the citizens can now sail on both sides from Of@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen on both sides .
the ev@@ asion by the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the deputy head of Director Florian King responsible for the technical management of the rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the residents of the highway , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ k .
&quot; since the speed limits were not observed , the community increasingly demanded the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; says King , who informed himself about the situation . &quot;
there have been already two to three per minute .
the fastest was on the road with 77 kilometers per hour .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at B 27 it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales bur@@ dens , each one asks you to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; for those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum light decline , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; the course of course &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most strongly exploited are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only it , but all restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we need to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; in addition , sales revenues increased to &quot; more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
&quot; street restoration has thrown its operation &quot; &quot; two years back . &quot;
he has to dism@@ iss the half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismis@@ sed , politics would have acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt addressed a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , the Gast@@ stätte would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the B 27 . now they have to bear the dis@@ advantages resulting from the renovation . &quot;
Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other districts where something more generous is handled .
&quot; in all defe@@ ats , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; the fact that other regul@@ ars pass less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot get here , it is also somewhere else beautiful . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , which is brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly being scre@@ wed to laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , interior minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now proposes a thick security package . &quot;
but what does a Dul@@ ce state have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the reconc@@ iling .
&quot; all of his proposals are &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior at the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t sur@@ pass anyone .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
posts : 15@@ 3@@ 38 NT@@ F &amp; C.@@ O.@@ N.@@ S. Co @-@ Star Â ®
&quot; however , as Minister of Interior , he was in the position of results and in a &quot; cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for safety in the republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot has already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security agency should take care of the communication of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère will start a second run for proposals that have not yet to be done with the SPD : he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ b ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; said the CDU man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he thinks this is reasonable and does not require any opportunities for the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
they partially have it in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted to land should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in case of Dul@@ ce for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than previously - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately reject their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legally cur@@ sing .
many things are still un@@ balanced and leaves them open to questions .
and at some point - in case of un@@ equal treatment of patients - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; moreover , in view of the high refugee numbers , many people were worried about safety . &quot;
and things that the people deeply occupied were not allowed to cling to in election times .
the inner security has moved enorm@@ ously into the focus .
&quot; the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elec@@ toral campaigns . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Union and the SPD are increasingly gaining in position on the subject of internal security . &quot;
in the past few days there was a great deal between the two parties .
&quot; only a dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons of the Interior , in which the department directors also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the dual citizenship . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; from a turning away from the double pass , he does not hold anything . &quot;
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
re@@ covering it is not useful .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has no constitutional objec@@ tions . &quot;
whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner does not yet have to show itself .
there &apos;s a lot of things that could make a fight .
&quot; at the moment , the SPD is also trying to pro@@ claim inner security . &quot;
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is not yet able to go through .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it is running smoothly .
there is a concept in the recall campaign .
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year in ship@@ ments .
&quot; in spite of diesel aff@@ aires , Europe &apos;s largest auto@@ graph can continue to demonstrate a plus in spite of diesel aff@@ aires , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the VW nuclear brand was weak@@ ening primarily in Western Europe and thereby imp@@ acted the total sales , such as the company noted in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s figure in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent lower than the prior @-@ year figure . &quot;
&quot; in the home market Germany , deliveries of deliveries increased by almost one sixth . &quot;
sales of brand sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , there have been a sale rel@@ uc@@ tance in some key markets through &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust air escal@@ ated first , a minus has to be be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the primarily affected house brand of the Lower Saxony has further deteri@@ or@@ ated by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition of 0.9 percent is available to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show a sales volume from January to July . &quot;
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles sold Volkswagen at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated off @-@ gas testing software .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling for around 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; according to the conversion of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the truck stop the customer after retro@@ fitting a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen is now weighing its German customers with a guarantee of re @-@ equipped diesel models . &quot;
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was such a meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the editions of my enquiry commission and the KBA full @-@ length . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting will not take place and all types of approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was in company circles . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen has the possibility that for example , for example half a year after the conversion , customers come into a workshop with an engine damage - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal , comes to uncertainty regarding possible warranty conditions , as it was said . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Raiff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savings in future pen@@ alties - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; CEO Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who are able to park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal Spar@@ es would not have to fear &quot; &quot; to pay for their spar@@ se pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee applies to Raiff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or Day Money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in future , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has had 40 million euros for some time , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other and which he could not exploit . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me in the central bank account and cause a 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the Head of Banking . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lie for each million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he now continues to pay the costs following the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
&quot; it would be much too dangerous to put the cash in the notes of the Raiff@@ eisen Bank : &quot; &quot; I have already experienced four rob@@ ber@@ ances , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the CFO . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investments .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy strategy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear them alone , &quot; &quot; economically is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have raised their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros , the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ bank and Raiffeisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 made head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , the chief executive of the German Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay full charges for deposits , the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele , which is more luxuri@@ ously equipped by the property . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if it was free of charge . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; no further banks are currently known to the Co @-@ operative Association of Bavaria , which calculate a le@@ verage rate for savings of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the German Volks@@ banken and Raiffeisen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , announced at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not be able to please that in the width .
destination plates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged men love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comment wed@@ n@@ esday , to sow it under the pseud@@ onym non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ ant men &apos;s middle age with harsh ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the rec@@ olle@@ ction of vinyl records is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending their own time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in S@@ oho in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oho , a modest gray suit , and I &apos;d like to say something more intimate like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ ho@@ s shr@@ inks slowly in its char@@ me - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were once independent - there is still a handful of fantastic sheet specialty shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
&quot; from Glasgow , 55 , from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data of eight men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; if he is a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have approx 3.000 or 4,000 sheets . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford than they appeared and re @-@ buy articles , which he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 1960s , early se@@ ven@@ ties that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought were a little too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media track , people who have heard about com@@ eback and are promp@@ ted to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to followers of the record ri@@ vals of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offers a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound space sleeves , from objects that watch happy adjustments . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; a staff inf@@ ects from a stack of sheet pil@@ es . &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at that time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while I was more pu@@ zz@@ ling through a stack of bos@@ sa nov@@ ellas . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( Number of Number : three men of middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone just came in and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ laden , less music @-@ like . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly get in . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the record to almost a whole floor , has an inter@@ rupt audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the a@@ forementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ thesi@@ zers and sex@@ t@@ pack@@ er pop instead of experimental jazz from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks odd , but serious psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are difficult to find if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of boards for sale . &quot;
it &apos;s more like a window shopping showcase than buying a big shopping .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ able si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the impression to brave the jeans jacket , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group for a moment to group Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - maybe because they are just decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these objects would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of So@@ ho@@ s for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my investigations yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave , at least in record shops in S@@ oho , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they do not spend their Thursday morning with the bum@@ ble@@ bees of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates while they avoid the star@@ ing view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who stands above the shoulders nothing of middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French court decl@@ ines offer on demo@@ lition of stores in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer from the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; at a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down , because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and health . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups judged the Court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the government supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also indicated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely tra@@ ce@@ able . &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Camp , which is operated as a charity and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as couns@@ elling on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian it meant that the closure &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants cher@@ ished on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer . &quot;

rein@@ forcement Story Trailer
&quot; Germany has to focus on the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new lightning devices will be tested , which are designed to effectively pass the pace of speed . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic real@@ ignment tra@@ ilers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used in areas of accident prevention , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itate bridges with temporary templates there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit . &quot;
a long @-@ lasting mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the rein@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : his battery holds five days in continuous measurement mode , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with Laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be captured over several tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits and traffic messages by time , driving strips and vehicle classes can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; according to manufacturer , it is possible to move the trailer with each car with trailer h@@ itch according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easily di@@ gest@@ ed , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also a non @-@ slip outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the cameras from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the specifications of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , following an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
UK pick silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold gets
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro stage in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back , line and rough force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was swe@@ pt by the not too bad t@@ rough price of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als the same day could fall to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago she lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fla@@ p will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began mar@@ vel@@ ously and let the attacks remove GB@@ s from fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if you were running in travelling buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 up when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au left in the corner .
&quot; with just four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he converted . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a well @-@ deser@@ ving T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but Fi@@ ji has only stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute of Ath@@ lete j@@ aza Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the Re@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still about a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u presses through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the interval .
&quot; it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 , while GB still st@@ oned . &quot;
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anian gap ... for whole four minutes that was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant Inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul , whose fans sang , flags blowing and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame made the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and the GB ki@@ cked out of crus@@ hing in the tur@@ f .
&quot; in the past , Fi@@ ji Japan had conquered Japan in semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain forced South Africa to hit a half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown led the bu@@ cks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with impressive foot@@ work and sc@@ ored a gate under the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that wants to be .
&quot; from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve , that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning took an extra significance in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they rowed the first women in the history of British Sports , who laid down such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 39,@@ ly un@@ fulfilled commitment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the trium@@ ph@@ al . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and it was none of the trainers than the coach , who would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer before 30 months . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing on itself is a challenge , but it makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ven@@ er@@ ous morning spent a little more than anything else , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; st@@ anning , which was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Regim@@ ent in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be nobody , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose any race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something to do .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race as we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding with her own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exemplary of clarity &quot;
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose @-@ association as a model for the big water producers .
this was the name of the Bavarian Broad@@ casting Corporation some time ago .
&quot; little later , the Water Forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia appreciated the association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the association for 31 years , is behind all this , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150,000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; municipalities are Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
for further towns and villages there are water delivery contracts .
&quot; the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller worked as a water @-@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ inger Association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they have extended office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the re@@ organization of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial restoration of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still , and there were always innovations again and again , because water yields life and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her speech , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
he has used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Water Forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; for this , he received a lot of praise and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller in his part praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water @-@ wart and he was a faithful kno@@ b .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well construction and re @-@ structuring of the Zw@@ inger Association . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the hard@@ est effort was the quar@@ ry at the high reservoir near Kirch@@ ner on January 3 . &quot;
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees , we had to work all night through , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the P@@ ett@@ stadt high reservoir with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who followed the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n County ) on Friday at 10 : 45 a.m. and injured it deadly .
&quot; the man himself called upon us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after him , he was publicly humili@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown and has a bald . &quot;
meanwhile the police have released a photo of him .
it is however a few years old .
&quot; meanwhile , the man has a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon in himself , so the police . &quot;
notice that it is not posible to insert more than one slider on the same page .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the local police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide information about the day @-@ to @-@ day or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but she confirmed that a person had been killed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a child mal@@ treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more than we do not say right now , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operation command@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene . &quot;
steel - Flash@@ view for German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial bur@@ dens that the industry threatened from renew@@ ables subsidies are from the table .
&quot; it remains at the liberation of the Renew@@ able Energy Tran@@ sition to the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned to use the steel producers , the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption , to ask for the register . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is an agreement with the European Commission for talks with competition commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced by a 20 percent E@@ EG lev@@ y .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s unification with the European Commission for self @-@ flow .
&quot; as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; it is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emission law , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed down , &quot; explained IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suff@@ ers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continued to wor@@ sen as the world &apos;s largest producer in China cast steel onto the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers reject Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import duties imposed on imported steel impact , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have been suspended . &quot;
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; in the latter case , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude certain works of individual works . &quot;
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 86@@ 0,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Industry Association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced quantity went back to the second consecutive month . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association anticip@@ ates an improved order situation with an increasing output . &quot;
&quot; community , mind , health : sing sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; the singing of Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total living , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does a good thing about her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; from several perspectives , singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , writes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; by regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures arise in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to agree and organise , to be able to depend on the others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
anyone who challenges his lungs regularly gets out of the d@@ olls even in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to obtaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labor Community of the Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , it explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs awak@@ ens many memories in older people , often associated with positive feelings of their youth time . &quot;
&quot; by lyrics and especially melodies , people have self @-@ denied incidents of long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; when singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
concentr@@ ating on one &apos;s own voice and rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
elderly people who live alone are not just concentr@@ ating on themselves .
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .

&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in an elderly choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ clesi@@ astic chor@@ us can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many sen@@ iors can also be found on the internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neigh@@ bors can ask for help with the internet search . &quot;

cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ ver on the cri@@ es of the k@@ itt@@ ens
&quot; bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover , which effect the cri@@ es of cat babies have on adult animals . &quot;
&quot; to her surprise , the ch@@ ew did not let the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the exc@@ itation of cat babies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te von Kitt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great need , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) have found out . &quot;
&quot; males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the ch@@ ew of less and strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens for the males are either un@@ percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding von der MH@@ H . &quot;
it is a du@@ sting in the study published on this Friday in the specialist magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the pussy @-@ cri@@ es differs with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for three minutes from the throw box and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings for three minutes .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who did not yet have their own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned more quickly to the loudspeaker when this cri@@ tique of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens was playing .
this ability may be con@@ genital or evol@@ ving with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded to all at all , &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises several times in humans . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann wrote . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski grab@@ s with &quot; GaLa &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warran@@ t has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey again takes place an important football match . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the ore riv@@ als between Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul about the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even at the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempt to overthrow in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be imp@@ aired . &quot;
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the attempted coup attempt .
there is no need to stop football in front of football .
&quot; against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r , the Prosec@@ ution issued an arrest warran@@ t . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the South Coast who is living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ me@@ r is supposed to be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , it actually does not affect the life of most Turks but as good as no effect . &quot;
the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy guards &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared an end to Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into tra@@ ilers and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as working clubs are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the anger of the Turks is the strict rejection of military leaders . &quot;
even the fans even agree - whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; in the event of the winner &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; , &quot; Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski will be returned to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with 17 gates and nine models in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he sc@@ ored the 1 : 0 victory tre@@ ffer .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an outstanding way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also withdraw early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it was only ranked sixth . &quot;
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as the game year was better .
&quot; above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season @-@ hits as the Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ gei@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue hoping for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , which was under contract with AC Florence , had announced only bor@@ rowed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his Euro vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club boss Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Stür@@ mer would have to be ready to wai@@ ve around a third of its annual budget of 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay its sal@@ inity to Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have won medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other ski@@ pped athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had su@@ ed her start right in front of the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was plu@@ cked and burned mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly at its start ( 100 meters br@@ is@@ k@@ et ) . &quot;
it was a bizarre scene : with a smile put on her she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
&quot; when it was established that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more sports@@ men , who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit down a six month lock after her capture of the pain by using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ co@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 have been tested positively to the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the full intake and was blocked for six months .
the four wid@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion above 400 m , was positive in 2010 and has been closed for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , stepped Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ed , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly any athletes have been recognized as many medals subsequently . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also reg@@ ained , due to a ruling by the International Sports Court CAS . &quot;
&quot; at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking list . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world record driver and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positively in May , but can still be started in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , evidence was found for taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA fell sof@@ tly and ran away on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian hurt - Sever@@ al deaths
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered injuries and had been treated in the hospital , but already left it . &quot;
her home trip was planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ uk@@ et and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are also affected . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life two bombs .
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; even from Ph@@ uk@@ et , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
&quot; in the det@@ on@@ ation near the seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured in police directions . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded that killed a city cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower be@@ et in front of the territory of the coast police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast called for several injured . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee free day before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it was too early to express itself to possible motives , but it is probably the case for the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not connected with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have received secret evidence of im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
nor is it clear what group is behind the attacks .
&quot; the police advised their officials throughout the country to enhance safety around important government buildings , airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings in Thailand , but usually they are not targeted towards tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the explosion in bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( safety level 3 ) applied for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between the security forces and the Muslim population , there is no need to travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applied to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution elabor@@ ated by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; said Jun@@ ta leader and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha , the bombs were an attempt to don@@ ate chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeps itself assured of having led the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; nearly a year ago , in Bangkok , in a bombing attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the most bloody stop in the recent history of the country .
the Right &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; is the visor of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several regional offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the federal government have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &apos; cl@@ ues for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; said constitutional head Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ assen of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional bodies in nine states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Wur@@ tt@@ emberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; in the decision , Ma@@ assen said that his authority was closely aligned with the regional offices . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the President of the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; extreme clim@@ ber Andreas Mar@@ th@@ aler has returned to his home in Sty@@ ria , the rugged mountain@@ ous region of Austria , for the first time in three years . &quot;
the Islam@@ ists are just as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising for their own cause .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports of contacts of the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ eres &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
Ma@@ assen said he did not know how to do that .
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point onwards . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase in illegal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and asylum seek@@ ers , Ma@@ assen said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be legal @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler Group .
&quot; it may well be that further legal @-@ terrorism groups or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee shei@@ ks or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ terrorism is not recogni@@ zable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; moreover , Ma@@ ate expressed his concern that many attacks went to the account of people who did not appear before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum requests were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have voted for the CDU , the SPD or the Left , who were then radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the brave performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics center , the easily over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia was so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his free@@ wheel with a gap of 48 seconds and won the 59@@ th place of 59 starter . &quot;
but it was rather his not just spor@@ tive figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ians had a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly made the first nickname the round .
some media recorded it as a &quot; ro@@ uble of wh@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he first struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres Freestyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention . &quot;
&quot; memorable was the appearance of the Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a run over 100 metres of free@@ wheel . &quot;
f@@ rene@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was then fired .
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia , and had never had such a long distance before the competition . &quot;

Tr@@ ump looks not so close to the im@@ pending election defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks on an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; should it be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; when Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it would be quite no matter : &quot; &quot; in the end , it will either collapse , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that is al@@ right , Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
&quot; he described US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post climb@@ s into the trade with electric v@@ ans
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously big .
the Post is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
&quot; shortly , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; from the next year , the post office wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free market . &quot;
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; said a Post @-@ Spe@@ aker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been checking its self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with which the letters and pack@@ ets are delivered to other companies . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen Ger@@ ard &apos;s post office had said that there are always inquiries , such as craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ des had announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and in the long term a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we are converting the entire fleet .

the back@@ g@@ itte appeared suddenly - but not quite surprising .

the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahler is already leaving the supervisory body with effect from 12 September .
&quot; as early as September 1 , the management board of the board of directors of Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , the board of directors , took over the company . &quot;
&quot; he is to officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the appropri@@ ations , the company called &quot; different views &quot; to the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
&quot; for details , a spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to mention the details . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; on Friday , on Friday , the shareholders were finally dis@@ appointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced ahead of years ago . &quot;
Mr Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also do the odds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not stop its dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales rose by 6.1 percent below the same level as the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the first half @-@ year , sales shr@@ ank at 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros by 3.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was mainly attribut@@ able to the decreased value of the company . &quot;
&quot; the company value de@@ preci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , posted a loss of € 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million under the d@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K had generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
eight people were injured on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors .
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , the police informed . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to his data , had to ev@@ ade a contrary vice , which was partly on the counter @-@ train . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a tren@@ ch like a spokes@@ person of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; because of the location of the bus , the people were not able to leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency doctor came to the accident scene on Landes@@ straße 2 .
the injured travellers were brought back by a bus to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators demanded the transpor@@ ter and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the price per cubic meter of waste water is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ th@@ ig@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( up to 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wa@@ ste@@ water fee will be increased once again , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after an over@@ lay calculation , the wa@@ ste@@ water price in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the household was established by the Land Council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach for these sewage treatment facilities . &quot;
&quot; due to legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ covering manner . &quot;
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ th@@ ig@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
fee rises between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed the committee , a re @-@ calculation of the charges for the wa@@ ste@@ water facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or over@@ l@@ app@@ ings from the previous calculation period were to be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt founded the grave fee increases by relatively small facilities with a very small waste water fall , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; for example , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect on the basis of the small distribution basis . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wa@@ ste@@ water volume in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the rec@@ ir@@ cul@@ ation period for all three installations was not least due to the age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses in a considerable scope . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ th@@ ig@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be spra@@ yed , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to keep the water @-@ regulatory requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the ongoing care and maintenance costs incurred , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the small waste water incident in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance are &quot; fully penet@@ rated . &quot;

&quot; according to stone houses , the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially since one cannot extend the supply area of the wa@@ ste@@ water @-@ purpose association Fri@@ esen@@ ba@@ cht@@ al because it is a lack of public facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria posted inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year as positive 0.2 % recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell by clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as a asi@@ an car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it &apos;s in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its Filter@@ tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already limit@@ less . &quot;
&quot; you can transform yourself into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ da@@ unted , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have gone into criti@@ ques in the past where they were accused of making the app Black@@ face promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week suggested a filter to some users , who gave them s@@ lot@@ ted eyes , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics ago called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others declined the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote in an e @-@ mail , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely spread across the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and the least said unpleasant . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the ja@@ un@@ face has been drag@@ ged into the degra@@ ding extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel wire .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
&quot; and snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in terms of race than their older opponents - might be more likely to assume sensitivity , too . &quot;
&quot; when one of Snap@@ chat &apos;s filters creates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that ra@@ cial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the recru@@ itment practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the big part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat is largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a staff responsible , focusing on sub @-@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence information in order to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Military Intelligence Committee , Intelligence Committee and the Military Intelligence Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Intelligence Agency , who reported how superi@@ ors changed their ass@@ essments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information , typically ingeni@@ ously wi@@ ped by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com units , reported a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed actual conditions locally and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , stated . &quot;
the guiding errors in the Cent@@ Com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government tips have given orders to change reports , it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were significantly more positive than the facts , &quot; stated the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that a military recon@@ quest can begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; ISO @-@ 2022 @-@ j@@ p ( Japanese , email ) eu@@ c @-@ k@@ r ( Korean ) &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the chiefs of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they had been assigned , that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be comple@@ mented by more detailed insights as the investigation continues .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com accounts are underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Department of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an excessive process for the creation of intelligence ass@@ essments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest @-@ ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; har@@ med mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essi@@ vely little space for differ@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no indication of intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st with regard to a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported about investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s chief inspec@@ tor , who were taken into complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress , while the investig@@ ators of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still under way . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have an effect on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information on the Islamic State recall the dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , fores@@ aw a small occupation force in Iraq , and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that in contrary to the statements of the government , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these temporary refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ Com Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
&quot; the U.S. win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain is standing &quot;
&quot; one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember it ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are simultaneously in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
&quot; the first @-@ placed will take a little longer to the strong Dutch , which will lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; whatever the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising bu@@ zz through their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games at the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ rie in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 since she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to a better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have the ru@@ d@@ der completely ri@@ pping around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door in the first half of the game with a hand@@ shake from the close @-@ up area .
&quot; India went into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed a surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a Sprint with the flat ball through the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the run of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling constant and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid stag@@ gering between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning stick , which is passed from the wrist protection to a swi@@ mmer for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can not turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the queu@@ e in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ opol@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a female black with dim@@ pl@@ ets , could easily have been among those familiar names being sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good @-@ TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even tra@@ der . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights gold in the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ oline . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I should rather make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline race has already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ sely perceived that many of those I had questioned were not aware that there is a Olympic mode at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the tramp@@ oline and had won an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final lap . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadian women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline jumping has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a clo@@ wn school than that for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has a hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ able trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending impact , but also the Gra@@ zie of the gym@@ nas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially un@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , stern and o@@ int@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are rated according to the official olymp@@ ic program according to version , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , upwards and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also a further enhancing goal in television transmission : those of the world or the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the goal oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed even when viewing these games .
the tramp@@ oline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolf into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is so Zen like competition at the Olympics can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the Ang@@ us and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male US tur@@ ner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base after air . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during coll@@ isions with the police at fire@@ places .
is Ethiopia straight to inter@@ rupt ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
but in the last months protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and spread to more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was mer@@ cil@@ ess according to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; videos on the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid F@@ di , head of the head of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a Research Group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous African country in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terrorism over the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , with dis@@ si@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; when you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of ground up to the stran@@ gl@@ eh@@ old of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts agree that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den have been forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence over the last few years and could re@@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness tend to explo@@ de after years of falling under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethi@@ op@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphone became more and more common and improved internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are doing at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that are hiding where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians allowed themselves to come together to protest .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from ae@@ op@@ i@@ ens predominantly Christian high @-@ lands , flour@@ ished in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tig@@ ray , which account about 6 per cent of the population and which are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , had been an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness until his death in 2012 for 17 years Ethiopia &apos;s Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and to make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime l@@ acks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ clear reasons to occupy the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia was experiencing such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 , after thousands prot@@ ested against elections , which report@@ edly ple@@ aded by the government according to the figures of analysts , and were then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s leaders praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of internal mis@@ e of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it accepts a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , managed by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently communicated that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very thin line @-@ up . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama has founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last contro@@ vers@@ y that surro@@ unds his campaign by claiming that his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clari@@ fication has raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public .
&quot; it also brings out his comrades who try to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position , statements which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump ru@@ sted on the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really did not intend to interpret , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early mor@@ early tweet on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the tweet was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he thought the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement , he reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing of it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism sho@@ ots out on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling in@@ security . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic again .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July , he raised strong criticism when he said that the Russians should be Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but he later explained &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive , and then possibly &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert observing the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ u@@ ely enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an estimated sound , since his survey values have continued to decline . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leadership with great advance in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but as he rein@@ forces the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ g@@ gers , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he pulled off the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; before the election events held in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of wra@@ pping around on each of his words and against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ology than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idency .
&quot; once the price comes from the market , café arrives in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ab@@ by café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were pushed out . &quot;
&quot; the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie shop , which was released in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local sur@@ vey@@ ed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel excluded and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , then it is also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a re @-@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , owner and managing director of the new coffee bar . &quot;
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new outdoor place , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so pocket model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ es like cap@@ ers and sour onions .
there are natural keys .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed out by the Willi@@ am@@ sburg Pri@@ ces , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after drawing to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee @-@ r@@ ink for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb that liked me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual I@@ ced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business had occupied the old business area .
&quot; in fact , the owners of soap Ch@@ erie offered to create a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee of the cafe as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will still go on offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants , Green@@ points , have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish , and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit them soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plenti@@ ful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took lunch in the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water Tur@@ tle Sou@@ p . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted from the Chinese kitchen in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man relates in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met a repor@@ ter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , local snacks in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh water sand@@ wich with olives , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; when the Repor@@ ter Hack@@ ed , this found the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se , and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap , which stretches the ingredient . &quot;
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as a dinner .
co@@ e sm@@ ir@@ ks .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; draws the path@@ ways with which the country has gone with it no longer to be the country of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; Co@@ e said why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new Bud@@ get@@ tin was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ies were too basic food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ alizing nutri@@ tious lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ able ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
strange mix@@ tures were tried because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
&quot; during her research for the book that includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addi@@ tive at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the domestic economic recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating habits of the country are so similar . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; households &quot; and the challenge of turning P@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa farmer &apos;s kitchen in his kitchen , he spoke like the millions of millions of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost golden dining room and bore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully real@@ ism .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the owners of a house@@ keeper were not interested in tastes by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was disc@@ ar@@ ded as soon as the country came back to the legs .
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to foods . &quot;
the couple gave the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better understood when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; She really made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag incident .
&quot; after the plates at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s cleared , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , adding that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ pped somewhat rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the t@@ ame , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E repeated three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
&quot; killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo , &quot;
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the lives of others .

&quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a group of civil protection groups who saved the lives of almost 60,000 people according to Bild @-@ Zeitung . &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life on the game in order to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Guard , showing him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said lou@@ dly : &quot; for me , this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die of saving lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four lap@@ tops over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing difficulties . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; the picture rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;

Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland shar@@ ks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland shar@@ ks only get up to 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms down on the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches a distance of just 1.@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it counts , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates at a speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , influenced by slo@@ wn@@ ess , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a great age . &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 39@@ 2 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein at the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life @-@ span which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist probably suspected , that Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks would become stone @-@ old . &quot;
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coastal areas of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the li@@ festy@@ les of Greenland .
&quot; their slow motion , they measured , when they exter@@ min@@ ated six animals with a broad@@ ca@@ ster in front of Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the ja@@ ws of a young polar bear . &quot;
perhaps they hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol the bottom of the ic@@ er and look for car@@ c@@ ass that tor@@ ches from higher water layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland shar@@ ks who picked up fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 502 cen@@ timeter measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens nucle@@ us of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is already being created before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
&quot; thus , after the early 1960s , their birth should lie as nuclear weapons seeking larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes , which were created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 335 years for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter long , while the record Ha@@ i with 502 centimet@@ ers was even 39@@ 2 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Grön@@ land @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
the researchers of the length could now associate an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 39@@ 2 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sex@@ ually mature stage and its age was determined for 156 years , Greenland shar@@ ks obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 years old Grön@@ land w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on on the neck stuck a 120 years old har@@ poon tip , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on spar@@ ames . &quot;
they mature then later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface through which the animal bu@@ cks heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life . &quot;

&quot; with topics around building , the municipal council has focused on the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee took note of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential buildings can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the land , par@@ cel@@ li@@ zation and detection issues have been clari@@ fied and the applications were placed on survey , the sale of land in residential construction areas &quot; Straß@@ le@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - construction section 1 ) is nothing more in the way to interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the bro@@ oks live in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it was said , Bau@@ will@@ ers can inform themselves in the town hall as of now , via the allocation of the plots , the Municipal Council is expected to advise the Municipal Council in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also meet requests for reloc@@ ation of other commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ timeless lar@@ n , the industrial zone already declared there is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; as a result , the city on the Main has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ iting from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Panel Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks are allowed to continue operating from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have previously approved the approval in the UK . &quot;
this is why big US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision of E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk ratio ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Luxembourg loses a large fund sector , but also cuts down in the infrastructure as it is in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt was much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .

Gilead ob@@ tains legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US refer@@ ee op@@ ted that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the hepatitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .

Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % of federal taxes
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton announced on Friday her tax declaration for 2015 , which resulted in the Pres@@ idential candidate of democr@@ ats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective German tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary Bill Clinton announced an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , publish his tax statements of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; gave Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ pers Jenni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false pron@@ oun@@ cements and tra@@ itors in terms of his previous promises to release his tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax inspection by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of democr@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the control inspec@@ tions are not complete . &quot;
&quot; finally , Tr@@ um@@ ps Cri@@ tic , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise issues relating to wealth , donations for char@@ itable organisations , his deal@@ ings and various other compounds , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the subject and published a video on the internet on Friday to publish his tax return in the high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lic@@ ans Tr@@ ump .
on Thursday she addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday stating that this could still be the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton is supporting a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ets whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away developed industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here , Tr@@ ump at a meeting to exchange their tax statements . &quot;
Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump is afraid of the elec@@ tors and not the tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return back to 2007 .
&quot; Clin@@ tons , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective German tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that they were only USD 100 in their income than wages , unlike most Americans . &quot;
their major investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9,000 were pet@@ ri@@ fied . &quot;

conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going down in human settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its funding along with U.S. natural protection by using volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before , many sc@@ iss@@ ors have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the Day of the Tel@@ eph@@ one Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants off their fields without damaging the eleph@@ ants . &quot;

&quot; Jewish director sm@@ ashes the Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ selection has been removed &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT news &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch , after reve@@ aling that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli pre @-@ election since Arab Gu@@ ests requested a &quot; &quot; employee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel through its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received , &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee told that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it solved even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election will be deleted , &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big shame , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this took place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the internet where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; some under@@ stated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged &quot; appe@@ ti@@ tes of Arab guests . &quot; &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly rejected all charges from itself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; Israel should not be included in the voting list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
add that the country code has been added now .
police op@@ ted tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students met in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system . &quot;
police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to sc@@ rub the students , which led to the police rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants have seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the pro@@ visional President Michel Tem@@ er spra@@ yed on walls .
&quot; the latest protests happened several days after demonstr@@ ators in masses went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been suspended from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly in the country , shared the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 , compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an is starting from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian agency issued some 3@@ 5,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran achieved the top 20 countries , as far as the number of tourists in Russia was concerned . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the ambassador is hoping that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social @-@ educational day group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection Federation Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers at their summer vac@@ ations in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet leisure park Hard@@ tw@@ inn@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
for one we went to Bre@@ t@@ ten with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
&quot; to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip took us to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the group at the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and planning on the hot days . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ prepared body@@ guards include the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , beautiful jewelry pieces made of beads and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the spare time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the past@@ oral care unit Ey@@ ei@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch in St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were met .
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next round@@ trip of all mini@@ stran@@ ts in the last two years , St. Anna &apos;s senior minist@@ erial round has decided to prepare and implement a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were tested and decided finally for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at Freiburg Cathedral &apos;s mercy . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ben@@ a , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and the holy place went on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Sch@@ r@@ ust sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ m Cru@@ ise and told the pilgrims . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a cathedral of Our Lady stood and so the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s Walk took place from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writings . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again did rest to sing together a song from specially created pilgri@@ m songs . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were at your disposal . &quot;
&quot; Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller cared for a tasty as well as a strengthening dinner , and breakfast . &quot;
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; then one stepped down the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at the lower heat at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then climbed again . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a common bar@@ bec@@ u@@ ing at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met at Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and walked through the gates of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse God was given thanks to God .
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were welcomed at the pilgrimage destination . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were characterised . &quot;
S@@ ascha Call@@ um Sk@@ inner cast@@ ed home when Br@@ ite rings Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the lead role , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic medals medals .
&quot; they repeated the trick , after finishing in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in London , despite the exception of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ fahr@@ ers Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as a Hin@@ du .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they remained as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folds .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y defeated - and Sk@@ inner prev@@ ailed in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap , Hin@@ der fell short of his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ des went into a higher speed to slow him down and enable Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der than they were on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make a name .
we installed an olymp@@ ar@@ cade at the final round and the world champion defeated .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys side he admitted that he fell on the train after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no claim of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB of flags at the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team over the last three months .
&quot; with so many world titles , we have gone so badly that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
with the form of Kenn@@ ys it is possible to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic Gold Med@@ als in a competition .
&quot; this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
this would be the same as Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will start over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old man from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the quick@@ est performance in four @-@ four kilometer race . &quot;
&quot; they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the finish . &quot;
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he was cont@@ ested with commission@@ ers before the qualification when he called him officials to measure his height .
&quot; in accordance with the Women &apos;s Competition which will be continued and ended tomorrow , Laura trot@@ ted , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Record Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team rel@@ ies on his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the average period of the Olympic Games and pick up a pair of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; in the background , drama took place in the background , so the withdrawal of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April was in the midst of sex and mos@@ quit@@ os repro@@ aches , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of GB@@ s , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land as a result of the lifting of the energy contract
the future of the aluminum mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ish all supply contracts as the supplying energy company communicated .
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is running out in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; no less than 2000 work@@ places -@@ direct as well as indirect , could be at risk of closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ating effects since the melting mining consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry melt , which led last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ a@@ ean power plant . &quot;
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land lo@@ oses money and ris@@ king a shut@@ down .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian Dollars and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L further said that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force as of November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; said the supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on the income of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecast of strong termin@@ ale markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L reported that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual subscription amoun@@ ting to $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt , &quot; is not affected . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts warned about the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt factory in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts each year and some 900 MW of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; power market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vog@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers brought me to cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , descri@@ p@@ tive reality video showing the entire car@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( with exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é episode of nearly every birthday child of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a radio station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to leave her other girl in this public@@ ity somehow . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of Vog@@ ue , safety has started a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vog@@ ue @-@ cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is for Vog@@ ue the most sold edition of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that more resem@@ bles an image band than a fashion magazine , the issue pul@@ ls a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) . &quot;
the revelation of his cover@@ stars is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the journal tran@@ spi@@ red before the official announcement .
&quot; women , who were on the cover , include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model@@ ed &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
&quot; Oscar Award winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jenni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs J@@ enner is described - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - under the former category , she finds herself in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to turn a good snap@@ shot video ( even if everything is true on J@@ enner ) .
they are truly talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
&quot; once again , Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was always slightly ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called her &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot; &quot;
these feelings co@@ ke up again when the message came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .
but to go round on the mis@@ m seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters have pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from Cin@@ dy C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is in reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; community centres have 16@@ 0,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s Au@@ xili@@ aries are rejected annually by the municipal asylum authorities , while the industry faces the impact of further Central cuts on over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ usions and similar - are dismis@@ sed on free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already ast@@ o@@ unding , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose further 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell Church Director said that the last survey of the National Convention of Municipal Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would be worse without a suspension of the Federal Government &apos;s resolution .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of need@@ y people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we urge the General Prosec@@ utor and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can receive the help they need while legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the government government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their customer communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Break@@ ing Camp@@ aig@@ n accused after employees allegedly drew a weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a gun in February while she was traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ i waited for months to have waited for the matter internally to be regulated internally , before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the course of Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after compl@@ aining to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged with the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the indictment is only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , when he said to a crowd in North Carolina , said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; were to take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton was elected and judge should appoint . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign clearly stated that the media would have ri@@ pped his words out of context and that he would not attack the violence .
B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of the duty of duty and of Philip due to bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a comment .

Por@@ osh@@ enko to speak at UN General Assembly meeting dedicated to large movements of refugees
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are notable for the governing party SPD and CDU . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD was over@@ thrown from 35.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party is only scar@@ c@@ ely afraid of the CDU , which could return to 23 per cent again . &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ested between the Left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens were rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant to return to the Schwerin Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent respectively .
&quot; at the election of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD is estimated to be only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; this is still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in slow motion : twenty years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched .
the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good at hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty ch@@ unk@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; came to stores just 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; office in the western pocket format &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive SMS and e @-@ mails for that time , even via fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , al@@ beit slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the price was very proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was at 39@@ 2 euros in 2015 .
nobody could fores@@ ee in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually was sold and handled by Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; the market today domin@@ ates suppliers , who came all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; ever and everywhere online , that is today for a lot of people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion Smartphone @-@ users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices sold , on Samsung and Apple , alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunic@@ ation company . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , everything is easy to use via touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the triumph of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the look . &quot;
&quot; they van@@ ished , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ wing now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , each German today looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Executive Board for staff . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must guide the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was in London in 2012 when we spent a lot of effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought major benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blo@@ om ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome but He@@ ath@@ row answers each question asked .
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way of creating up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot;
&quot; now , they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this olymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; message : Hello , I was looking at rock @-@ gear.de today and found something that might be interesting for you . &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; K@@ atz@@ - and mouse @-@ play &quot; is the same for companies who earn money with online advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on his desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post which told users to update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertisement in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the code for its advertising display to make it more difficult to detect the indication of which part of the page advertising is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ battle between the announ@@ cing open source community and the chan@@ ters has already been in progress since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe worldwide , around 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 per cent of the advertising revenue fac@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has set it on desktop PCs on desktop PCs , because mobile ad block@@ ers don &apos;t have any effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs is making a big share of revenues so Facebook appears to be a worthwhile investment in such a step .
on Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preference utility &quot; to give people more control over their commerci@@ alized advertising .
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that adding new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; &quot; shared a Facebook spokes@@ person in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control in people &apos;s hands . &quot;
to over@@ ride woman with presum@@ ed suicide on the Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls on witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning was transferred to a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay down in the Dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss resident at the age of 49 , who was over@@ run by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them to report this and every witness of the incident . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter distributed the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - where one person ran out in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
&quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted after having passed and killed a man who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became un@@ conscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the police -- who responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA &apos;s climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA , Venus was probably once hab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate research .
&quot; the model has been designed to determine whether Venus could once be applied with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once er@@ similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously suggested that the slow revers@@ al of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly moved forward . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from a fast ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow revolution of Venus displays its day @-@ side of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; explained G@@ ISS scholars Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a umbrella , to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously suspected of planetary researchers . &quot;
&quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
her oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and her water vap@@ or was burned away from the ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy returns as trainer of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a low degree of co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years , I fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy commented on a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth this requires and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 thank@@ ed him for his contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Coach of the League during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
&quot; he took the club on 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference to score five points .

&quot; the labour struggles regarding the remun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties ple@@ ad to the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the Wood Field Service Provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process of the current conflict , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will stop some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to rest@@ art the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group this year has shor@@ tened the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market swing .
shell has dismis@@ sed thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ alized its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ union with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish MEP , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion of spending on new projects in the North Sea are expected to be approximately $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ neck of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates , among the stars of the star of the Ple@@ j@@ ades . &quot;
the new data help astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star @-@ area rotate at different rates as well as in what context the rot@@ ational periods are related to planetary creation .
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star @-@ names , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , created around 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars come across large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between occurrence of recogni@@ zable star@@ marks -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es stars with dancers , with bigger stars revol@@ ve slower than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star @-@ neck of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ straps of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s still much ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang their &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the migration rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

the tears slept with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of base to base .
&quot; after his emotional response announcement , the 41 year old pro will carry the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ ampa Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to this , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant in Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
he signed his signature under a ten @-@ year contract for 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and a youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
as a player it paid Rodri@@ gu@@ ez for a long time with power .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed several mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; was on the field , his appearance is outside the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , banned ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received effective funding for years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I spent 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot;
even his f@@ arewell @-@ days did not run smoothly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends still get the big stage in their last play , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; adds Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , got to know the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , sympath@@ ies of fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing sample , weight lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland are not allowed to start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a sm@@ ud@@ ged ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ ots have become famous for the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter steep@@ le ch@@ ase in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions this news is coming to an end . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday which is used as a m@@ asked means for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m butter@@ fly , only by 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en could have participated in the courses over 50 m Freestyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing have been filed . &quot;
&quot; the national federation took the matter &quot; very seriously and demanded full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio , the news spread across the positive test in Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act in the banned substance around the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Probe should also have a positive impact . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to the athle@@ tic leader .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; Bulg@@ arians stand under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chronic dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation may not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days before . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , especially the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association had prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , and also the L@@ umin@@ ant nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the previous contracts in China were also provided for fierce debates among the athletes . &quot;
&quot; thus , Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang . &quot;
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ ed purple , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Freestyle , I want to hand over myself , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the centre of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested in the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 with the Stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ di , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
&quot; Dragon Ball Z : &quot; &quot; the Le@@ gend@@ ary Super@@ sa@@ i@@ y@@ aj@@ in &quot; &quot; eng &quot;
program@@ mers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey by malware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes several victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already achieved a ran@@ som@@ ware solution . &quot;
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly the ran@@ som used by the perpetr@@ ators to re@@ use the attacked systems and data .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize in attacks in company networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ out ran@@ som is considerably higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re currently watching a frigh@@ tening quick evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Manager Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in recent months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , she seeks to search for recently modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als permanently .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Bit@@ coin cryp@@ to@@ currencies . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production stopp@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses caused by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent had even had to inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; several hospitals in Germany have been victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only fo@@ sters the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies , who pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stagn@@ ation . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have investigated the commercial and contact with the black@@ heads and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain to their victims per chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free support websites or deco@@ ding free sample files . &quot;
&quot; and if individuals are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must negotiate highly hard and pay five @-@ digit tot@@ als to return their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potential high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski of the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons . &quot;
the program@@ mers sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware kits were created by buying malware , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ ids then look for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; so one logs in one of the Forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals occupy sp@@ amm@@ ers with the dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is known by many companies that better secure their data . &quot;
more than 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware via file Back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpetr@@ ators instead thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is a multiple higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators could have completely new targets on the internet of things in the future . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating might well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little Coupé and also the versatility of a Mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V acts rather small , the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and are pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top side falls off there . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l for high @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l in reverse back@@ rests available , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a child chair and thus offer storage space , which is height up to 1.@@ 24 m from the floor to ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges .
but he should al@@ ign his work somewhat more quietly .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the security system is part of the City emergency braking assistant ( working up to the speed of 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane Assistant . &quot;
the coll@@ ision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed regulator respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and cho@@ oses speed when required .
&quot; the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI connector are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
&quot; the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , you will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 emissions standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
airline distance to the airport
an airline is not liable for the over@@ throwing of a passenger on the passenger &apos;s jet@@ ty .
&quot; a liability is only conceivable with regard to dangers , which are typical of air traffic , the Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a kne@@ ec@@ ap by throwing down .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
case of disease : when paid by the promot@@ er
holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is without doubt found in the hotel .
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten per cent of guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negoti@@ ated case , a family was seriously ill in diarr@@ hea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; your illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a faul@@ ty sewage treatment , which suppos@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea water . &quot;
the family thought that the trip was therefore defective - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the sewage plant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the organizers realized only shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his duties , thus the judgment . &quot;
especially since there were no im@@ puri@@ ties found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belong to the general risk of life .
there were only 38 guests from 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; said that after the violent acts committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have taken care of further attacks . &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorist acts .
sure is : our country will not answer the violence of the offen@@ ders with hate and sch@@ ism .
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , this is the security and strength also the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère seeks to implement the proposals until the 2017 parliamentary elections .
&quot; he also announced another personnel rein@@ forcement of the security forces , &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ format order of magnitude for several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be subject to punishment . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the arm@@ our will be am@@ ended so that the purchase of weapons on the internet is more difficult . &quot;
the least discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in the dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions , as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister also considers better social care . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further improve security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior has clearly expressed himself against Action@@ ism .
&quot; this was an ear@@ thing for the Shar@@ pers in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abo@@ lition of double citizenship .
a general prohibition of full @-@ wear does not consider it to be un@@ constitutional .
&quot; you cannot for@@ bid everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
it is possible to talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
Simone Peter over@@ threw the minister who wanted to simul@@ ate action and action with new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verbs and a tigh@@ tening of the right of residence permit people in this country no longer security . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it is regularly sto@@ wed on the circum@@ navigation road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal status of the law shall be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers driving in traffic on the ambient line every evening in traffic jams when driving over the motorway toll Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) , the state @-@ owned road construction is extended by 700 metres in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot;
drivers can then drive directly from the hammer street to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : traffic divi@@ des itself early , thereby improving the overall schedule on the most frequ@@ ented section of the federal highway 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district coun@@ cill@@ or of Münster @-@ West .
drivers travel on the Zu@@ br@@ inger train drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back @-@ bus goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h road and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason for this is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only lowered single @-@ lane via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back in three @-@ quarters years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load @-@ bearing capacity , in order to absorb bi@@ lanes in particular for heavy @-@ load traffic . &quot;
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the resulting traffic jam is going to last , cannot say the responsible state operation . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be expected with years : the bridge has an official remaining duration until the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal subscription period , the state company deliberately chose the busi@@ est time during the school holidays because of disability to be expected . &quot;
traffic will be held on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule invited the theatre piece &quot; Das Un@@ visible Haus . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s Association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das Un@@ visible House &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural voyage , initiated by Verein N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural voyage , &quot; 19 pupils visited the little house between 11 and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee issues , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; the majority of the youth of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , such as the Short news of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s Association , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December youth with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
special offers for children and families in theatre play and theat@@ rical language teaching are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the star@@ ving Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night to Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly suitable for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday mor@@ nings . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star shed is Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips about sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces
&quot; in the evening you roll up forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before wak@@ ing . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces speak ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there are many causes behind them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter we@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Batt@@ ling and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands among them is , however , the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in @-@ in and diarr@@ ho@@ ea disorder . &quot;
&quot; this means that many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , Member of the Board of the German Medical Association with practical experience in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; this includes organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early wake @-@ up is especially frequent in case of depression , &quot; &quot; says we@@ eß . &quot;
and it can be that different factors are due to each other .
&quot; for instance , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
from when should one go with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor .
&quot; impair@@ ment can look quite different : you are tired , tired , tired , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; there are hardly any dor@@ mit@@ ories in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine centre of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact the doctor . &quot;
it can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab and what happens ?
&quot; for example , for the examination in the sleep lab , physicians advise against snor@@ ing with breathing problems , in case of illness @-@ fatigue , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not take a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after c@@ abling you go to bed at its normal time .
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is shown on the ceiling . &quot;
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of stu@@ d bolts that can be used for a better sleep .
&quot; that counts : regular sleep and rise times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch television for sleep , stop drinking alcohol and not watch at night - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming to have
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he had first brought gold to the first world champi@@ onships in Doh@@ a and at the same time exhibited his first world record . &quot;
the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has now placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mate in front of his critics .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20.000 € bonus and a jungle King 150,000 € shouldn &apos;t be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveying system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , are very good . &quot;
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; he explained further . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS can be controlled by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who now operates an ice cream . &quot;
airport : baggage allo@@ wan@@ ces fixed
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 were arrested on Thursday . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and bags of luggage as a band .
&quot; at 9 : 30 pm , civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to police officers of the past th@@ ef@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and were in a communal , temporary and very professional manner . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the criminal commission@@ er 34 can prove four acts , which have been submitted to Germany specifically for crimes committed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between still a rem@@ nant cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in does not seem so , but the police numbers them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; passing the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly constructed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a grey house , someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be dem@@ ol@@ ished , a house with high windows and 133 new rented flats will be built here until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , in recent weeks , however , preferably with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin internal sen@@ ator Henkel had expressed himself several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on June 22nd , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling out parts of the street for three weeks and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later the police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain themselves in late sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the neighborhood since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who raised three children here , are particularly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the skin projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who held a majority of police protection against the v@@ and@@ ali@@ ent left . &quot;
&quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police arise between land@@ owners and their neigh@@ bors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which even today has a low average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under large police force in a down@@ right street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and ball@@ ers from all over the world : with them residents from GDR times and former home@@ owners share their neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected in the rent , which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 in new rentals . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them on the thrown windows or freshly painted fac@@ ades that have been disc@@ ar@@ ded with colour bags .
&quot; no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily harm , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the offen@@ ders make material damage , which tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the disp@@ uted 94 for 17 years , there can be no doubt about uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for acts of violence , it is wei@@ ghty : people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who are certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga anymore .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously moved to the Riga street - and has remained .
&quot; it was therefore also so important that the residents got their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the clear@@ ness of the district . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes pushing the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - here people are rather people who are not so well contaminated , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should one do if someone never li@@ stens to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the residents . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; anyone who comes from , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area , can complain bad about noise . &quot;
all persons named only with first names have asked to not be named with their names

Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agogue supports the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working groups refugee assistance , administration , authorities and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Kunde from the Arbeits@@ kreis indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the egg @-@ laying wool mel@@ ee , which has a problem above all . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less spot@@ ting than on the wide variety of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , an en@@ rolling Woll@@ k@@ utz@@ kow . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place limited for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers are standing in the basin
&quot; for some time , it has been a serious problem to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been acknowledged . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or hired flats .
&quot; the costs for construction , rent or renov@@ ations of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Office of the Office to the Commun@@ e and the Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; in effect , administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it doesn &apos;t work so far you depend on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , communal dwell@@ ings must be in@@ famous as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be placed in the washing road . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword : Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and job assistance for refugees and migrants who need to be gre@@ ased or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so it needs offers like sport , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are involved .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problems , too , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; all this is a &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer tells quite clearly what some people might call &quot; nai@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them . &quot;
&quot; however , the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed . &quot;
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins bring them up completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with them , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so primary and honorary citizens must look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new shock could soon come to Ur@@ bach refugees and immigrants .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics dis@@ g@@ ust itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to spot them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the &quot; &quot; Ur@@ bacher &quot; &quot; are already busy integrating the existing human beings in a reasonable way . &quot;
&quot; currently , these are around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
result : passed Address : enco@@ ding : ut@@ f @-@ 8 ( detect automatically )
the helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forced to move into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am .
the people surprised both of them and struck the aw@@ k@@ ward into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.70 m tall , probably m@@ asked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black ho@@ o@@ ded pul@@ lis . &quot;
they fled to the city centre .
the police took several stri@@ kers as well as a police helicopter .
the prosecution proce@@ eded without success .
&quot; possibly , the unkno@@ wns did not fall near the apartment or when they fled . &quot;
