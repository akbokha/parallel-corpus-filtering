<seg id="12">The first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps economic policy comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the two US presidential candidates, however, are at the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump does not want to remain small in doubt and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, he would be quite different, asserted Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively withdraw regulations, and he makes himself strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain duties, he has privileged opportunities to open up and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for this reason, taxes would be increased for the rich," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost immediately."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">Government investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical wing of the Republican Party.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump there might be party internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and re-drive the coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its investment programme, Clinton specifically wants to expand the renewable energy and demands:" a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the dspaziffer trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of us do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, demands about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says," "The minimum wage must rise, then he says that he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics guard him, so that the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">"escape:" "every escaped woman has experience with sexual violence" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is a part of women who are fleeing alone, almost everyday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looked curious into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until it notices that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene appears normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the division manager of Condrobs, a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs created the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard against the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman arriving here has experience with sexual violence during her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families are sending them as hope-bearers to Europe," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Women outweigh other reasons for the flight: "many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, volunteers, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, are mistaken, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and abused in worst case."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this results in the fact that about 90 per cent of women who live in the North of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children have certainly not come up voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are accustomed to say that they don't say anything.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experienced, because shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, they need more accommodations just for them, demands Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether or not they knew from a similar project like in Munich, they answer no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Swabia alone, escaped women are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower Saxony and Central Franconia there are some common shelfs or houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be sheltered from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are being shelved separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing, or if men and women are accommodated, it can lead to - perpetual violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in particular, the washrooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible for women, is included in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel about this need of protection can be seen at the rush, which gives it to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been around for us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily set up a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputies of the assistants have called upon their union to approve new work of work in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="4">The JDC declared that ministers would have failed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistance and medical students have voted in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members, who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" persistently quiet "to issues, which led to the refusal of the treaty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In view of this, the JDC Bureau has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and calls for official new negotiations on all your concerns."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot forbid the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed to be narrower and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly from his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report full of five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even be improved."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper complained that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad had never happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first one mentioned in its introductory words: the downturn of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin dismissed and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the offence was even greater, since it was committed by a putative friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the confidence will become difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the controlled media controlled a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations from leading officials that Erdogan would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could hire a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed for all friends he can get after he was given nearly his ministry last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Veghosti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious to the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued grudge over the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pippled to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus for the fact that after the attempted coup d" état, he called for support for the elected state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glamorous palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray the" alliance of outsiders "as an analyst once described," two countries that are expelled from the West and feel poorly treated and are now allied. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both the presidents at the press conference said they did not even seize the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentionally avoided a question of their differences, while Putin decided to accentuate them."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will at least talk to one another."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who was vice-president since 2012, was appointed to his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin, it is said (in Russian) that he later was the chief of the staff and staff of the government personnel."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment:" "thank you for your confidence." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your work as head of government with regard to bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow secretive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for a long time, Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidants Vladimir Putin and worked as he worked for Soviet intelligence, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff would withdraw from his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is there the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at present.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official claim, that a man who once was praised as a potential president, suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin referring to the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated item - you could almost say - embarrassing post for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the position in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin was a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted in most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was accepted that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term of Putin violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, closest ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before three and a half years later became President.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling blowers", "which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 oblique ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown today paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck at its place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete base today in Rosyth, meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first clasp is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high-pressure and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the northern tower deck located in the extension, we had to close the existing gap on the north or south side."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge, 700 millimeters south."</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the tolerances on which the team worked, they were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens think: investors should in future be put into duty much more strongly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 favourably cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "room concept living" at the next council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said S & D vice-president Christoph Bratmann comments:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the big controversy in the town hall is, however, as violmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent, but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing construction program, which will cost millions of dollars, should be paid for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so violently:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wishes to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher runs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"notwithstanding, as violmann, there is an intensification of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the construction management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the programme does not yet fully exist: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how does one compare the loss of other 1,300 affordable apartments whose funding will run over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved at one stroke.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West city the year-end deadlines are running out.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the number of social housing in the West city is drastically increased, from the objective of so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged parts in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"s & D vice-president Holger Herlitschke believes:" "for a broad majority, the CDU has to go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">"in fact, they have been concentrating on more building plots for single-family homes."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children don't go outside to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time on staring on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the television, then videogames and finally on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later they created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go has more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found" "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game has resulted in a significant increase in steps that the" average "person lays back every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch who pursues 35,000 users, shared the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of traced people practicing every day 30 minutes, 45 percent were leaping to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take about 30 minutes to come" "from the sofa" "and" "to be active each day" "on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look elusive."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"those who regularly drive sports, reduces their chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always there are also sullen backlets, which have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will take time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and will help many people hunting, more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the police reported that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child is shot."</seg>
<seg id="3">The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">"grandparents admitted that brown had suffered several injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm, and belly, but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="5">"he has done a lot, his small body was permeated by bullets," his grandmother Delores gave to the broadcaster. "</seg>

<seg id="8">The family of the boy informed the broadcaster that he is expected to recover.</seg>
<seg id="9">He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been in every summer olympiad since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish and Madison Kocian who is Catholic, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic-female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an American American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were last year.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising, Olympic winner and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they provided unexpected, yet masterful grammar routine."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-competition event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnastics throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympics will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that Turning is an expensive sport and is primarily driven by private trainers who are maintained by parents who are maintained for training, training, travel and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer by Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to inspire the communities of aun countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible exercise training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers (especially black and hispanic), and national and international winners are trained."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic team golds and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year for the release of a government report for corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correcision has led to the fact that widespread elections in Muslim communities are ignorantly ignored as a devastating governance report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles intervenes verbally the police, election observers and Raths to have ignored evidence of misuse due to" oversensitivity regarding ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Communal Government, who is now a slave-king, said that the intimidation of religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside of electoral bodies to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have a hint with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter merely needs to name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to apply removable ink to the finger of a person if they give up their elective voice to prevent someone to vote twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to church records and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only aimed at election fraud, but should also protect the municipal government against the wider corruption and financial fraud that comes with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election campaign in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special electoral Tribunal decided that the Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be abused after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court ruled that" "Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "in cynical ways" "and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations."</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation in which one person chose as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed alarmingly to the deceitful letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leadership of instructors to prove the identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" as evidence, pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in particular communities with Pakistanese or Bangladeshi backgrounds. "</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have unknowingly ignored this behavior due to "politically correct" oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to cleanse the system, including the ban that political activists work briefing documents to stop" reaps. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, requires harder registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social security purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">"do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has released her voice, to prevent someone from choosing twice."</seg>

<seg id="31">Photography prohibited in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the election stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees generally assert that voters go to the electoral cabin themselves.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric runs through the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "amazing" "that after the Tower Hamlets has been no criminal complaint."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election tribunal has explained Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, it was found guilty on the basis of the high requirements of the criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "check-out controls" of the election registration departments of the town hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spreading of election fraud and denial of some authorities menace this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to spin the skewer for your robbers."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approached from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and move from the firing line," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit the face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"beat him with his knees in the chest and twist while the aggressor is crooked before pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the gun on it."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the firing line, grab the gun and twist it, so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"shift the weight onto the weapon at the same time and hit the attacker on your chest, then flip the gun from its grip before moving backwards and the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and Würgereflex a serious test - by making some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk crashed his train on a Euro ticket, a banker at Piccadilly Circus, a spreader of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of the leaking of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is getting into."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to leak the rinsing button of a tensile toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left that he licked out more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his gut by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to train stations to flushing of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitely below a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud-water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely justified in his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample-painting showed a luminometer population of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometer quantity of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to leak after its luminometer population was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "this comes close to the worst thing I got in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not dock here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended with saying "Let us call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in colorectal cancer is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film direction, added:" let me say so - I lost my respect for Ian, if he had some of the things I had told him to lick, just like the ecelly Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to dock, and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all interrogated lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said they should at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls showed plaintive holes, wooden boards were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for home management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons, who were living in the apartment meanwhile, and the police said that the terror that the family had added, seizures of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strikers and curses included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>

<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogiated her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The deluction were cheered by lightened neighbors who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They were not interested in anyone. "</seg>

<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager von Cornwall Housing, said that it would have failed to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police were called up at regular intervals, for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="26">Garbage and old toys were dumped on the crowded part of the village house</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenant desist to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family since a delogication is always the last step taken by Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageous toward us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comment wednesday, to sow it under the pseudonym non-Alleenant men's middle age with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the recollection of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending their own time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in Soho in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit, and I'd like to say something more intimate like:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos shrinks slowly in its charme - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were once independent - there is still a handful of fantastic sheet specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) to Reckless Records (data of eight men, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"if he is a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have approx 3.000 or 4,000 sheets."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford than they appeared and re-buy articles, which he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 1960s, early seventies that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought were a little too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media track, people who have heard about comeback and are prompted to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the record rivals of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound space sleeves, from objects that watch happy adjustments."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "a staff infects from a stack of sheet piles."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at that time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while I was more puzzling through a stack of bossa novellas."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (Number of Number: three men of middle aged), has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came in and said," "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put it on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-laden, less music-like."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly get in."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the record to almost a whole floor, has an interrupt audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizers and sextpacker pop instead of experimental jazz from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks odd, but serious psychic traumas are difficult to find if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of boards for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more like a window shopping showcase than buying a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is..." she drives away with a dearable sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression to brave the jeans jacket, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - maybe because they are just decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these objects would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my investigations yielded that the results of YouGov agree, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they do not spend their Thursday morning with the bumblebees of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates while they avoid the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who stands above the shoulders nothing of middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in the Calais jungle in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"at a trial hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down, because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and health."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups judged the Court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the government supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also indicated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were" absolutely traceable. ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feed people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Camp, which is operated as a charity and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as counselling on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian it meant that the closure" for these children would be a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">The two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants cherished on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer. "</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro stage in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji distributed a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line and rough force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was swept by the not too bad trough price of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals the same day could fall to them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the form of this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began marvelously and let the attacks remove GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in travelling buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau left in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with just four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a well-deserving Tackle of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but Fiji has only stopped."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute of Athlete jaza Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the Reanpfiff and there was still about a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presses through further weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the interval.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is like Fiji was born to play 7, while GB still stoned."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijianian gap... for whole four minutes that was good for the circumstances of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran through a brilliant Interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South seeinsul, whose fans sang, flags blowing and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame made the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded the Fijis embraced and the GB kicked out of crushing in the turf.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in the past, Fiji Japan had conquered Japan in semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain forced South Africa to hit a half-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown led the bucks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with impressive footwork and scored a gate under the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than with these games and that wants to be.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first stroke to the last, 220 hard pieve, that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning took an extra significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed the first women in the history of British Sports, who laid down such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39,ly unfulfilled commitment, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes, who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumphal."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to incremental advances that make the difference and it was none of the trainers than the coach, who would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer before 30 months."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, in case that under such circumstances is the correct term."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to get better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing on itself is a challenge, but it makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a venerous morning spent a little more than anything else, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"stanning, which was a Captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin, we would be nobody, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose any race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up, panning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something to do.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race as we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding with her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to conceive that I am an Olympic Champion."</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Flashview for German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from renewables subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains at the liberation of the Renewable Energy Transition to the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission was initially planned to use the steel producers, the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption, to ask for the register."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is an agreement with the European Commission for talks with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel works are replaced by a 20 percent EEG levy.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's unification with the European Commission for self-flow.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as a result, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign" "Steel is Future" "it is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of the emission law, climate and employment targets are to be weighed down," explained IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation continued to worsen as the world's largest producer in China cast steel onto the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers reject Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has a little relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel impact, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have been suspended."</seg>
<seg id="22">Forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have stagnated."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the latter case, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude certain works of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 860,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, mind, health: sing seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing of Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and a total living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does a good thing about her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"from several perspectives, singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, writes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"by regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures arise in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to agree and organise, to be able to depend on the others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be strenuous in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for doing so, seniors train deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who challenges his lungs regularly gets out of the dolls even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to obtaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labor Community of the Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, it explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening of songs awakens many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time."</seg>
<seg id="18">"by lyrics and especially melodies, people have self-denied incidents of long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrating on one's own voice and rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Elderly people who live alone are not just concentrating on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I practise for something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in an elderly choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastic chorus can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet search."</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="17">"last but not least, there have been reports of contacts of the" "Identiteres" "to AfD politicians from several federal states."</seg>
<seg id="18">Maassen said he did not know how to do that.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point onwards."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case, the AfD - by certain persons who are extremist, changes their direction and become so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view of the significant increase in illegal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and asylum seekers, Maassen said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard."</seg>
<seg id="24">But in recent years we have found that there can be legal-terrorism structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that further legal-terrorism groups or small groups form, the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee sheiks or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, a nationwide or Europe-wide control of right-terrorism is not recognizable."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"moreover, Maate expressed his concern that many attacks went to the account of people who did not appear before in the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspects in attacks on asylum requests were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent, or have voted for the CDU, the SPD or the Left, who were then radicalised by right-wing extremist sentiments."</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympic games or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the brave performance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics center, the easily overweight swimmers from Ethiopia was so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was chosen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte became an internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his freewheel with a gap of 48 seconds and won the 59th place of 59 starter."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sportive figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopians had a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in sub-represented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most sportsmen run in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly made the first nickname the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media recorded it as a "rouble of whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the English tabloid" "The Sun" "with" Dad Bod "made fun of him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he first struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres Freestyle, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussambani provided media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"memorable was the appearance of the Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a run over 100 metres of freewheel."</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was then fired.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia, and had never had such a long distance before the competition."</seg>

<seg id="1">"the price per cubic meter of waste water is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welthigahl 3.44 instead of 2,10 Euro; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2,26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to 2.18 euros)."</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased once again, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after an overlay calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then lie at 4,37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the household was established by the Land Council of Kulmbach for these sewage treatment facilities."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal basis, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-covering manner."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of 1 October 2016, the citizens and industrial companies from Welthigahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">Fee rises between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed the committee, a re-calculation of the charges for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"during the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or overlappings from the previous calculation period were to be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt founded the grave fee increases by relatively small facilities with a very small waste water fall, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect on the basis of the small distribution basis."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the wastewater volume in all three systems is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, the recirculation period for all three installations was not least due to the age of refurbishment and repair expenses in a considerable scope."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welthigahl, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the sewage plant in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be sprayed, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to keep the water-regulatory requirements in the future."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its Filtertool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that is already limitless."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein paintings."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are undaunted, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have gone into critiques in the past where they were accused of making the app Blackface promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested a filter to some users, who gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and evaporated cheeks, some critics ago called a racist caricature of Asians -" "yellow face." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversy pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"grace Sparapani wrote in an e-mail, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely spread across the photos that the filter was" hurting and the least said unpleasant. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the jaunface has been dragged into the degrading extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">"and snapchats great audience of young people - who are diversed in terms of race than their older opponents - might be more likely to assume sensitivity, too."</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is insulting for a user," "it's much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it was earlier," "said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the recruitment practices at Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticised the big part white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions," "said Chinesich-American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that the Snapchat is largely unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a staff responsible, focusing on sub-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts."</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence information in order to draw an optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Military Intelligence Committee, Intelligence Committee and the Military Intelligence Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Intelligence Agency, who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically ingeniously wiped by high-ranking CentCom units, reported a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed actual conditions locally and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, stated. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The guiding errors in the CentCom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government tips have given orders to change reports, it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the congress were significantly more positive than the facts," stated the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom has publicly announced that a military reconquest can begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"ISO-2022-jp (Japanese, email) euc-kr (Korean)"</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, is so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the chiefs of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the Republicans called the Task Force into life after they had been assigned, that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights as the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the CentCom accounts are underway by the Secretary-General of the Department of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessive process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest-ranking Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "harmed morals among analysts and" gave excessively little space for differing opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no indication of intervention of the White House in the CentCom Analyst with regard to a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported about investigations by the Pentagon's chief inspector, who were taken into complaints by CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress, while the investigators of the General Inspector are still under way."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" "experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have an effect on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information on the Islamic State recall the disagreements of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, foresaw a small occupation force in Iraq, and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker stated that in contrary to the statements of the government, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these temporary refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"CentCom Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the first-placed will take a little longer to the strong Dutch, which will lead the other group."</seg>
<seg id="10">"whatever the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising buzz through their success story, four years after they landed in the last London games at the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockeyrie in hands (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became National Player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 since she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to a better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the rudder completely ripping around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the door in the first half of the game with a handshake from the close-up area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India went into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed a surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she completed a Sprint with the flat ball through the left flank, then moved to the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the run of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling constant and inescapable, a rapid staggering between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is passed from the wrist protection to a swimmer for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leopoly or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a female black with dimplets, could easily have been among those familiar names being sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good-TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, turner or even trader."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights gold in the olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should rather make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline race has already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was so sparsely perceived that many of those I had questioned were not aware that there is a Olympic mode at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had won an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final lap."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadian women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has some outsiders, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has a humorous potential - the cartoonable trembling of its never-ending impact, but also the Grazie of the gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, stern and ointtos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are rated according to the official olympic program according to version, difficulty level and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down, upwards and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also a further enhancing goal in television transmission: those of the world or the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatigued even when viewing these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolf into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen like competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the Angus and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US turner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base after air."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during collisions with the police at fireplaces.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight to interrupt?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was merciless according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"videos on the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Fdi, head of the head of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a Research Group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous African country in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism over the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, with dissidents being effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you suppress people and have no other options except protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of ground up to the stranglehold of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts agree that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden have been forced to exploit the turbulence over the last few years and could rearm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness tend to explode after years of falling under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphone became more and more common and improved internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are doing at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that are hiding where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians allowed themselves to come together to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who mainly come from aeopiens predominantly Christian high-lands, flourished in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under a screen," "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tigray, which account about 6 per cent of the population and which are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, had been an unpublicized illness until his death in 2012 for 17 years Ethiopia's Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to occupy the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia was experiencing such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which reportedly pleaded by the government according to the figures of analysts, and were then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the subsequent raids many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"Ethiopia's leaders praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of internal mise of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters attacked in Gondar, an amharian city, managed by Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently communicated that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr Abdi said, "is a very thin line-up."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama has founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"on Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by claiming that his repeatedly repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification has raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings out his comrades who try to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position, statements which he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rusted on the claim on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to interpret, the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morearly tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he thought the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement, he reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing of it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism shoots out on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling insecurity."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July, he raised strong criticism when he said that the Russians should be Mrs. Clintons's emails, but he later explained" Of course I meant the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive, and then possibly" clarify "according to how the reaction fails." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert observing the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vaguely enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an estimated sound, since his survey values have continued to decline."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leadership with great advance in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but as he reinforces the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal comrades to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercessors, gave great effort to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," Mr. Giuliani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backggers, completely wrong, and therefore it happened because he pulled off the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events held in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of wrapping around on each of his words and against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't! ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trumps's apology than just another proof that he was unsuitable for the Presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took lunch in the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Water Turtle Soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Coes last book" "Chop Suey" "acted from the Chinese kitchen in the USA, while Ziegelman relates in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," An decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, local snacks in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh water sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the Reporter Hacked, this found the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, Leberkäse, and Bohnenbrot."</seg>
<seg id="15">"they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap, which stretches the ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as a dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe smirks.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male fellows and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "draws the pathways with which the country has gone with it no longer to be the country of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense theme," Coe said why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new Budgettin was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseries were too basic food, the casserole as a" wonderful way of realizing nutritious leftovers, "noted Ziegelman, as chefs were able to hide unappetiable ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried because a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book that includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular additive at noon," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the domestic economic recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or ever, budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923-1943 - the eating habits of the country are so similar."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" households "and the challenge of turning Pampe such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "a Square Meal" "is a feast of historical delicacies."</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, reports on the response of the government to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-food-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmer's kitchen in his kitchen, he spoke like the millions of millions of the world he has become."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost golden dining room and bore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realism.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only get up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland shark swims down on the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches a distance of just 1.220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it counts, the five meter long animal accelerates at a speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, influenced by slowness, seems to be a panacea for a great age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at any rate from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," "commented Alexander Scheuerlein at the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life-span which means a world record for vertebrates."</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist probably suspected, that Greenland-sharks would become stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coastal areas of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyles of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow motion, they measured, when they exterminated six animals with a broadcaster in front of Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaws of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps they hunt dormant animals or patrol the bottom of the icer and look for carcass that torches from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland sharks who picked up fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimeter measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is already being created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"thus, after the early 1960s, their birth should lie as nuclear weapons seeking larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 volumes, which were created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter long, while the record Hai with 502 centimeters was even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönland-shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">The researchers of the length could now associate an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature stage and its age was determined for 156 years, Greenland sharks obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 years old Grönland wal, in whose bacon on the neck stuck a 120 years old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on sparames."</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature then later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface through which the animal bucks heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the pastoral care unit Eyeial-Haigerloch in St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together four stages were met.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next roundtrip of all ministrants in the last two years, St. Anna's senior ministerial round has decided to prepare and implement a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations were tested and decided finally for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at Freiburg Cathedral's mercy."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Grubena, and Haigerloch and the holy place went on the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Pastor Schrust sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrim Cruise and told the pilgrims."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb, it was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a cathedral of Our Lady stood and so the Pilgrim's Walk took place from Münster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and writings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis on field crosses, chapels or churches again and again did rest to sing together a song from specially created pilgrim songs."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the nights, the parishes of the local parishes were at your disposal."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty as well as a strengthening dinner, and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then one stepped down the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at the lower heat at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then climbed again."</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecuing at the Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg."</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly relieved and happy, the Minis met at Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and walked through the gates of mercy."</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse God was given thanks to God.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the evening mass in Münster, the Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed at the pilgrimage destination."</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the divine service, pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar."</seg>

<seg id="1">Sascha Callum Skinner casted home when Brite rings Gold for cycling.</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the lead role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after finishing in March at the London Underground World Championships in London, despite the exception of Hoys, only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Anfahrers Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as a Hindu.</seg>
<seg id="8">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which they remained as they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy defeated - and Skinner prevailed in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap, Hinder fell short of his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which Hindes went into a higher speed to slow him down and enable Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hinder than they were on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am just here to do my best and to make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We installed an olymparcade at the final round and the world champion defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the Kennys and Hoys side he admitted that he fell on the train after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no claim of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels like the whole GB of flags at the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">"with so many world titles, we have gone so badly that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kennys it is possible to repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic Gold Medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">"this would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will start over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old man from Bolton said: "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the quickest performance in four-four kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">"they arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish."</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he was contested with commissioners before the qualification when he called him officials to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">"in accordance with the Women's Competition which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura trotted, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong railway team to dominate the average period of the Olympic Games and pick up a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in the background, drama took place in the background, so the withdrawal of the technical director Shane Sutton in April was in the midst of sex and mosquitos reproaches, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland as a result of the lifting of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminum melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby abolish all supply contracts as the supplying energy company communicated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is running out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workstations in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">"no less than 2000 workplaces -direct as well as indirect, could be at risk of closure."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to dominating effects since the melting mining consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014 Alcoa concluded the Point Henry melt, which led last year to a closing of the Anglesaean power plant."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland looses money and risking a shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation in terms of the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian Dollars and last because of the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, supplying the large aluminium smelting with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting," shared the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL further said that the contracts were so-called" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force as of November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," said the supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the income of AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecast of strong terminale markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL reported that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual subscription amounting to $187 million in" "anticipation of a cancellation." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" Ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt, "is not affected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still an explanation why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"due to the poor economic conditions in the industry, analysts warned about the possible closure of the Portland melt factory in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume around 600 megawatts each year and some 900 MW of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator, that wouldn't be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this Covers brought me to cry," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians like?), descriptive reality video showing the entire cardashian Jenner family (with exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché episode of nearly every birthday child of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we had forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a radio station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to leave her other girl in this publicity somehow."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of Vogue, safety has started a new era of the Kardashians."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vogue-cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that more resembles an image band than a fashion magazine, the issue pulls a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertisement)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his coverstars is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the journal transpired before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women, who were on the cover, include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years there were clearly more "celebrities that modeled" as "models that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar Award winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs Jenner is described - which is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - under the former category, she finds herself in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or youths of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything is true on Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who are in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"once again, Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners do not like success to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always slightly tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her" the Mistakes of the Moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings coke up again when the message came out with the show Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and Internet in slow motion: twenty years ago the Nokia Communicator was launched.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good at hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was pretty chunky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory at the beginning was eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" "Nokia 9000 communicator" "came to stores just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as" "office in the western pocket format". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive SMS and e-mails for that time, even via fax was the communicator."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was very proud: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was at 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could foresee in August 1996 that communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Finns mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually was sold and handled by Microsoft."</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction Heathrow, just as it was in London in 2012 when we spent a lot of effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought major benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprentices, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be such that will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too great."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bloom ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-fters were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome but Heathrow answers each question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way of creating up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in witty growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and in the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now, they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this olympic spirit and extend Heathrow as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police calls on witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning was transferred to a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay down in the Dark" in an act of despair "on the road and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss resident at the age of 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police told them to report this and every witness of the incident."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigative process was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter distributed the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA, Venus was probably once habitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model has been designed to determine whether Venus could once be applied with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once ersimilar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow reversal of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erd-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly moved forward."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from a fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow revolution of Venus displays its day-side of the Sun for almost two months," "explained GISS scholars Anthony Del Genio in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a umbrella, to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model brought forth a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution that was previously suspected of planetary researchers."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates, among the stars of the star of the Plejades."</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers to understand why stars in the star-area rotate at different rates as well as in what context the rotational periods are related to planetary creation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other star-names, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="5">The Pleiades of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears distant from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this constellation, created around 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotational rates, these poignant stars come across large amounts of starches."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as these winds travel through the stars of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars."</seg>
<seg id="10">"when a star is aged, its rotation rate begins to slow down."</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between occurrence of recognizable starmarks -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates points out that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rebull compares stars with dancers, with bigger stars revolve slower than smaller ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the star-neck of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star-straps of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"it's still much ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational rates and hang their" "dancing shoes" "so to speak."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by malware protection specialists Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes several victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already achieved a ransomware solution."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid willingly the ransom used by the perpetrators to reuse the attacked systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks in company networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to blackout ransom is considerably higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we're currently watching a frightening quick evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes Manager Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, she seeks to search for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end-key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Bitcoin cryptocurrencies."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production stoppages."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses caused by ransomware, 13 per cent had even had to interrupt business operations, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"several hospitals in Germany have been victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only fosters the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies, who pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have investigated the commercial and contact with the blackheads and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain to their victims per chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set free support websites or decoding free sample files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must negotiate highly hard and pay five-digit totals to return their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potential high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware around within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that these are three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits were created by buying malware, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "says Wisniewski."</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmaids then look for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so one logs in one of the Forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected computer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips about sleep disturbances</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening you roll up forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before waking."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances speak?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there are many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Battling and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands among them is, however, the insomnia, i.e. an in-in and diarrhoea disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"this means that many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the Board of the German Medical Association with practical experience in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this includes organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake-up is especially frequent in case of depression," "says weeß."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are due to each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for instance, those who have a herniated disc can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should one go with sleep disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look quite different: you are tired, tired, tired, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there are hardly any dormitories in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, for the examination in the sleep lab, physicians advise against snoring with breathing problems, in case of illness-fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not take a nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">After cabling you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera is shown on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of stud bolts that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"that counts: regular sleep and rise times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, don't watch television for sleep, stop drinking alcohol and not watch at night - then one starts to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin internal senator Henkel had expressed himself several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area as a" no-go-zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on June 22nd, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, patrolling out parts of the street for three weeks and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later the police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in late späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighborhood since 1999, and Jana *, who raised three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who held a majority of police protection against the vandalient left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin internal senator and the police arise between landowners and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which even today has a low average income and high poverty risk."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street very close to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was evacuated under large police force in a downright street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and ballers from all over the world: with them residents from GDR times and former homeowners share their neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is reflected in the rent, which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 in new rentals."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: one can recognize them on the thrown windows or freshly painted facades that have been discarded with colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other road was mentioned this year along with the words" "left autonomous violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily harm, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the offenders make material damage, which tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no doubt about uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for acts of violence, it is weighty: people in the 94 are their neighbors who are certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously moved to the Riga street - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"it was therefore also so important that the residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the clearness of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"however, in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless new buildings in former mosquitoes pushing the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here people are rather people who are not so well contaminated," she says. "</seg>

<seg id="16">Soon new containers are standing in the basin</seg>
<seg id="17">"for some time, it has been a serious problem to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or hired flats.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for construction, rent or renovations of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Office of the Office to the Commune and the Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in effect, administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it doesn't work so far you depend on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, communal dwellings must be infamous as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be placed in the washing road."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword: Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and job assistance for refugees and migrants who need to be greased or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help home masters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so it needs offers like sport, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are involved.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problems, too, says customer honestly," people with whom nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is a" "mammoth task". ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation, even in a small church like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no, Regine's customer tells quite clearly what some people might call" naive. "a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">"however, the helpers are already sensitised."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins bring them up completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with them," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So primary and honorary citizens must look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new shock could soon come to Urbach refugees and immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics disgust itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to spot them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">"the Regine customer also makes it clear that the" "Urbacher" "are already busy integrating the existing human beings in a reasonable way."</seg>
<seg id="63">"currently, these are around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
