Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not straight friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abil@@ ising measures in the Middle East .
but it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critici@@ zes Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement expansion and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu a lack of will in the peace process .
the deal of the two further deteri@@ or@@ ated by the deal by Obama concerned with the Iranian nuclear program .
&quot; in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech that was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election referring to the election in Israel at that time . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girl@@ friend shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb commented with a somewhat sensitive voice from the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
&quot; within the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled upon a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Pol@@ ish@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the disa@@ strous emergency at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; a day after the shooting in the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself men@@ tions Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited classes of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problem behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who pra@@ ises Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something with him was wrong . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb captured himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his par@@ ental home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
in the spring he received his doc@@ torate in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ time girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when she met with friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool old guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar . &quot;
he was the black woman at that time .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which borders on a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb arrived Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stood on a summer @-@ fair two years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of September 5th , after Lamb ended his guitar and oral harmon@@ ic@@ ity before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and j@@ esting together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the complete professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Fr . Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lectur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the watch guard , while the University choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported on Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans supported this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
toys R Us plan to hire less workers for the Christmas season
&quot; toys R Us says there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby @-@ product dealer says he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it plans to employ 40.000 humans in shops and distribution centres across the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 4@@ 5,000 workers were employed . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application talks this month and the number of employees increased from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to furn@@ ish shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
the film begins and it seems to me that I am a simul@@ ated ya@@ wn and an arm length away with the Princess of Wales at a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ str@@ it@@ ably the biggest Zeit@@ geist film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the nearly five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader once again calls upon all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he lam@@ ented that spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation impossible .
ban calls on the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey figures showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as flop .
others have taken him off as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the opportunities of nomin@@ ating real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to the rising her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like E@@ b Bus@@ hes Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey parameters indicating that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps wei@@ r@@ ty values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the Real Estate Mog@@ ul positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are kept in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa has found last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters were happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; happy , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about dump ) . &quot;
the next one in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters continue to believe that real estate Mog@@ ul has the right tem@@ per for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first pres@@ elected state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think he did not have the personality to perform effectively , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their funds , Republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time four out of ten end of July their money put on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P constitu@@ ents did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; however , a variety of GO@@ P constitu@@ ents Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign can be seen as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes yet almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field will probably contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed over a dozen other candidate countries . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump ear@@ ns the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker , 15 points , ahead of Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ uns and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump Fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have given their votes firmly .
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can truly say anything to change . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have imagined they are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in the matter of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign two months ago called immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rape , &quot; &quot; the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse was in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expressions of Tr@@ ump crucial Hez@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but following the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the li@@ mel@@ ight is left , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently will do . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
&quot; meanwhile , on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish@@ ly anno@@ yed .
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential areas &quot;
here at Hob@@ oo@@ ks@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view of the North Sea Lake .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a floor @-@ roof @-@ house costs EUR 7@@ 3,@@ 300 . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - hence the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter is the most cost .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , however , one of the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square met@@ ering rates in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well @-@ marked . &quot;
&quot; OK , now I just want BF@@ 1918 / 2 . &quot;
&quot; by the way : as an exception , Munich is not at the top . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold sc@@ orer in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ äus - then it went .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
world Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record @-@ champion Olympic ak@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers twin pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth win in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants finally to catch the pi@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run . &quot;
&quot; at his 28 hit in the Champions League , Müller received a gentle assistance from Olympi@@ ak@@ os go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who left a f@@ lange @-@ thought shot of the world champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; asked Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium against 31,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ blo@@ o@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based speech . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without sh@@ atter@@ ing .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his last six home games in the royal class , including among other notable clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid , or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they were cour@@ a@@ geous in their offensive efforts , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often introduced by reloc@@ ation to left @-@ side Douglas Costa , which rarely crossed over the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper angle .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion missed the potential 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , as Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Polish head ball off the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct tak@@ eover , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee was par@@ ked ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians moved into their accu@@ stom@@ ed dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to pin needle stit@@ ches . &quot;
but Manuel Neuer was a decree .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; in front of him , Guardi@@ ola took a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cabin , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; said sports board Matthias Sam@@ mer &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ s@@ ley Com@@ an for the failed Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59 . ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear for 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller placed one on it . &quot;
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator @-@ block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of Pi@@ raeus having words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with striking blocks against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; it is not only the lung , but also the teeth - that suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; the good news : when wai@@ ving , the risk is reduced rapidly . &quot;
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smoking smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers have the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 times higher . &quot;
more than 23@@ 300 participants observed the scientists .
&quot; major causes of tooth decay are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , acc@@ entu@@ ate the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore go back to frequent inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment went back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , ground @-@ breaking Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham declared . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained H@@ einer Boeing by DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; smoking is good for lung and vessels , and according to our findings also results in good dental health until the age of old . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness was affected by the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ sc@@ ored the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet on the banks of Cologne based on rem@@ n@@ ants of the late Anti@@ quity
&quot; for the second time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered a specialist for archae@@ ology conservation . &quot;
arch@@ e@@ ologists were now found in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards .
&quot; text documents have already been known that in the fourth century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves which probably belonged to the church . &quot;

European Commission proposes a new court in dispute on T@@ TIP
&quot; in order to def@@ use the conflict over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private scho@@ oling devices for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which significantly reflects more traditional dishes in its mode of operation . &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; said Commissioner @-@ based Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de preferred to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by T@@ TIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is to rise with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely stipul@@ ated that the EU states and the US collec@@ tively select independent judges for a new Investment Court .
&quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise objec@@ tions against verdi@@ ct .
&quot; until now , the proce@@ eding parties agreed with each other on the arbitr@@ ators , an opportunity to claim their judg@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the debate over the past few months , it became clear that citizens failed to trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work according to its own information on an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proce@@ eding in particular ( IS@@ DS ) is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , on which companies can make claims for damages of tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws , or reduce consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations such as Camp@@ act reported the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German state secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; during the reform , the Commission took key points that the Federal Economic Affairs Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration was from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European Business Association of Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the legal claims of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
&quot; on Wednesday , when the talks on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , continued un@@ clear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer valid .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s talk . &quot;
&quot; he tells us about various places he always draws on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ est and delic@@ ately arranged songs are reporting . &quot;
where they were born and how it looks there in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative mis@@ er . &quot;
&quot; with the release of the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; musi@@ cally composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent drift . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first install@@ ment of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should follow . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine near@@ ness , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already been released and has a positive expectation . &quot;

the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic pieces of off@@ sets . &quot;
&quot; this sixth record studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; since the smaller clubs have been desc@@ ended , the stage shows are becoming a colorful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage dé@@ cor . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the premi@@ er of the Prime Minister with suspen@@ se since his election
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionna@@ ires and to join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six pres@@ et questions shortly after noon . his performance by the media is likely to be examined by the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several front pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said that he had &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he told the Labour president to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of Shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are calling on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported it as a leader . &quot;
the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within the Labour &quot; stac@@ king &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour changes submit to remove the whole idea of a limit in total .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow labour and pensions minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has T@@ ory boss over the dis@@ patch box in the Parliament last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy paper , says that he has &quot; &quot; Cro@@ wd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question is too con@@ front , and that he will refra@@ in from &quot; &quot; comb@@ at@@ edness &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ kers with hooks , and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle will represent the shadow of Economic Prime Minister when he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he has also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; punch &quot; &quot; theatre that is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question . &quot;
&quot; since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the questionna@@ ire with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds increase by accelerated pay@@ roll growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound escal@@ ated according to data that indicate a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s goal . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and succ@@ es@@ ful assessment of the time of an interest increase since 2009 .
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,5@@ 505 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over @-@ offer of the ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; after encouraging news from the competition corporation for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher . &quot;
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares increased by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of his debt recovery strategy .
&quot; the shares of Mond@@ i &apos;s packaging and paper company were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had made his assessment of the company &apos;s rating for &quot; &quot; sell &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; JD Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the general manager of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs in his company , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could be the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

&quot; it is both - in the pot@@ ato@@ e @-@ cro@@ wning , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; potato instead of twe@@ eter &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat has put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato rather than D@@ ön@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he had seen on television acci@@ dentally . &quot;
&quot; since then there is a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea of the Leban@@ ese has now been registered at the German Patent Office in Munich .
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains .
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
the culinary international understanding also goes well with his customers .
&quot; message : Hello , I was looking at rock @-@ gear.de today and found something that might be interesting for you . &quot;
Met@@ rac tried to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food Wholes@@ alers Met@@ a@@ cash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ a@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA by mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as iron manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store owners who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ a publ@@ ishes further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices carries out its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shop stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two countries after opening its first markets and anticip@@ ate all existing assets , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , analy@@ st Tom Ki@@ er@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ millions of sales annually and met@@ a $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost $ 13 million profit before interest and taxes , Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ a@@ cash loses market shares in eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ a@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash declined to publicly react to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of Mr Dou@@ glass has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ AS market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retail@@ er , has declined by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction with simultaneous print on turnover and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , hon@@ ors and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ to purchase sale prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores by faster growing fresh foods and to deliver a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging infrastructure programs are set to rise and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return for the first time in 2017 , for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deser@@ ved to view the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism of his own behavior .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; went into the spot@@ light by the not@@ orious engagement of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after@@ ward , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee with Har@@ rison : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have hit Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was finally seen how he hit a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp disgu@@ ised a potential U.S. OP@@ EN victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ tly defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am rather en@@ vis@@ aged is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat as he lost in the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi is good enough to know he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated with a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gios on the important decision , which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term solid component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick was very quick to as@@ certain what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray made . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , and it is best for the crew and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared not@@ ary , closes the border , stops refugees &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and eg@@ ulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the goal of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted to a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations increased .
&quot; as a police helicopter scre@@ ened over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian occupation police . &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be reconc@@ iled .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in over@@ run Italy and Greece . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a lively action of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation that was rested on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country after it has completed a fence along the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison terms were deployed during the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most incoming business refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees seeking protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws which came into force around midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher pen@@ alties for condemned human traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military that is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities knew 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come here by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of breaking criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are there to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to get there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway junction between Serbia and Hungary and said they would deny food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s advance in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders recorded in a national survey
&quot; former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to maintain a double @-@ digit promin@@ ence in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ elled for the Pres@@ idency of the President receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries .
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders recorded some prizes . &quot;
Clinton keeps a big lead in women and moder@@ ates but these projec@@ tions have decreased .
&quot; your support in men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders will only return with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a great advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin among the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections could say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time for a wife to be president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the accep@@ t@@ ability are also quoted .
&quot; as the Vice President poses a potential for the Pres@@ idency of the Pres@@ idency , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked of the pre @-@ elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s advantage is increased in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bid@@ ders in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a nomin@@ ee with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the constitu@@ tion@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors in the prim@@ aries is un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates yield good results in some important features among voters in the pre @-@ elections of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leader . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not consider him . &quot;
&quot; in general Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are looking for democratic voters in the presidential elections in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , a quarter of democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions relating to Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an external minister , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of ten who say that their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 per cent of the eligible voters do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the eligible voters see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; but Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks in leadership . &quot;
&quot; from the six cont@@ est@@ ants , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut off the best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than fran@@ k , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves on a nationwide survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; in the meantime , half of the voters support the two candidates in the new survey , and others lose themselves dramatically . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month by 27 % in the pol@@ l of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives at demographic groups well and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ uns , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who died on the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at the third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s into the surveys - at 19 % support in the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the dump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ des for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps Faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign performance in Io@@ wa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only remot@@ ely , a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people don &apos;t go into the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares . &quot;
&quot; swimming temperatures , on the other hand , continues to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even rises to up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the tip 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the br@@ otherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College New Year
&quot; almost two years after a student died of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons are submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack filled with sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood didn &apos;t call the 911 number after Den@@ g was power@@ less and suppos@@ edly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
&quot; but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to change his symptoms to goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and fundamentally represented the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly suffered injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student has died in the chic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; fr@@ at@@ ernity and its members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received an indictment for murder of third gra@@ des for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of a criminal attack and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned - officially or in@@ officially - this is sanc@@ tioned , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local population . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an increase in interest comes , and the house@@ wife will get into the bath , yields will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy is only a small guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore representatives of the US Central Bank stressed so sharp@@ ly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , however , market participants could find out that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that net assets will be discounted from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may once again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study to what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is usually upward - about 14 per cent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal conditions after 500 days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal conditions after 500 days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , with average yield in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the hei@@ gh@@ tening cycle and the return begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest raises them often . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions previously un@@ available and which could speed up a recession . &quot;
remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in a interest increase of F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rates since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest raises in a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raises the question , &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; all the eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade shows only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all ery@@ thema @-@ cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ed heights are very quickly put after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one has maintained since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest increase and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than for shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease is done in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the replacement cycle , the app@@ endi@@ ces immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest loans often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones says that the markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , len@@ ding has expanded and volati@@ lity continues to increase - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; the large and large companies will benefit from the greater part of their business activities in the United States , where interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will get worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debts . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
debt is a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how quickly this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the Sender for its &quot; &quot; de@@ duction &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished by commercial ri@@ vals .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards and said that they were only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grab@@ bed The Voice , saying that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that does not do the private broad@@ cast@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ is@@ hable from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also went to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the alle@@ g@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competi@@ tor when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , finding new music and commissioned new works , I also really consider important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work would be to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; but Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC &apos;s production , which during the hearing in the committee on the choice of culture , media and sport came under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grab@@ bed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wants the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; &quot; when it &apos;s next time a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at slo@@ west and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slo@@ wed its expenses in November
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost@@ ly cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say there are indications that online sales stagn@@ ate once new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
total spending for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts predict that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back until 2000 , then that has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales re@@ xes the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , as a buyer began to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that &apos;s going on , and we will be able to see that growth decreases . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decre@@ asing revenues .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which takes place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times saw the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer was fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyer from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 expenditure was spent a bit more than £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases will now be carried out via web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion labels in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia is laying down the crash in part of the huge Saudi Ben Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 39@@ 4 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury them that were killed as a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mos@@ que .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the proc@@ ession was passed on to the holy place , where only days before a construction crane passed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed@@ side . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe that left 39@@ 4 injured , a san@@ ction hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 beds , who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the yearly H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have to steal the arm of the crane when it was not used . &quot;
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the crash .
&quot; the news agency service provided by the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad should be prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was praised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , who fell into a large courtyard of the Grand Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims live in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which is taking place later this month . &quot;
the Bin Laden Group did not reveal any statements about the collapse of the Cran@@ s and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal decree added the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ kas Grand Mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the reign@@ ing family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a teen@@ ager son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once required in the life of any healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other injured are given half of this amount .
B &amp; Q boss says that the time of the cheap East European arti@@ sans is over
&quot; British employ increasingly mechanics , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has a rise in
&quot; this will result in 200 additional screens , which are designed for professional tra@@ des@@ men . &quot;

&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that Brit@@ ons lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified eastern European arti@@ sans , who carry out the work in their home . &quot;
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or brush to brush walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; British employ increasingly mechanics to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ f@@ isher who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ shops because eight of ten purchasing decisions in the shop are made by women .
at the moment men out@@ weigh the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends , which show more female single households who do more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we have to shift this more strongly to a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry who is one of only five women at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed companies has also men@@ stru@@ cts her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occup@@ ies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the State Court Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball championship A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and disp@@ ensation .
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the pre @-@ investigation , the def@@ endants agreed in the years 2006 to 2011 those of the association accounts they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; it damages the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; to blame for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence laid out that at no point was an asset in the association . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials just paid expense compensation and the sports club , for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt . liabilities in the year 2001 amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ illing ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we carry the club further or un@@ lock ? , &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the chief audi@@ tor of the financial am@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with : you can manage the money freely , it is only allowed to pay any debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the expense compens@@ ations was decre@@ asing until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expense damage was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detail revers@@ als appeared , the former chairman explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and dic@@ tion@@ aries jointly managed the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association was not interested in detail for the financial provision , but it was important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the balance sheet in 2011 against the one function@@ ary investigation . &quot;
&quot; that had been appropri@@ ations , the def@@ endants replied . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; then he thought , he thought that this was the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known about this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused was informed , the function@@ ary justified . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity . &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? they wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
&quot; the first accused , however , stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association was never har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; By whom you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never referred to a cent salary , he merely earned mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he charged EUR 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual expenditure had been much higher , he added . &quot;
the def@@ endants could not confirm accurate documentation for the early years .
&quot; according to an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , these were no longer maintained , they explained . &quot;
milestone was also referred to as the second def@@ endant .
&quot; all dwell@@ ings are made in cash , in order to do so from his residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard Boo@@ sts another 30.000 Jobs
&quot; in addition to the personnel breakdown of the company for three years , the computer giant will be disman@@ tled for further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the stops at the US computer giant Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not find an end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 vac@@ ancies in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) were to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
the step will lead to a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars incurred as of the fourth quarter .
&quot; the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has grown up with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , is currently out@@ dated : this is how the computer and print business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the future @-@ oriented areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC paragraph , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers according to its services , last updated the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; thus , the proceeds went back to 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP respon@@ ds with spl@@ itting and massive positions on changes in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted until late , that customers buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and get more and more shops online . &quot;
&quot; the restructuring plans have a total of 5@@ 5,000 jobs in total . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would largely come up against rejection : 54 per cent said against it , 35 per cent agreed . &quot;
&quot; that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
&quot; in cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of respon@@ dents declined , 20 percent would be . &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .
Auto : second press day at the 6@@ 6th I@@ AA
&quot; at the centre of the fair stand up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 65@@ th International automobile exhibition under the motto &quot; Mobility &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the wide public can visit the I@@ AA from Saturday .
&quot; the organizers of the V@@ DA trade association anticip@@ ate about 900 000 visitors two years ago . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ ts in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have used the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Water Desig@@ ners against several hundred disper@@ sed refugees .
&quot; ( detect automatically ) ut@@ f @-@ 8 ( Unicode , worldwide ) ut@@ f @-@ 16 ( Unicode , worldwide ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 1 ( Western Europe ) &quot;
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees crossed the border .
&quot; after that , a police line had been formed and a water @-@ thro@@ wer was standing behind the polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials were initially using pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spar@@ ed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now dismis@@ sed a little back@@ war@@ dly .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried .
other refugees ch@@ ased together and suffered from breathing difficulties .
the Ser@@ b police officers also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the central bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves if the US staff is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent will last . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; she warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
Delta State University accused of death cap behind repar@@ ations
&quot; after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues on the day and killed , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; &quot; he could do it wrong &quot; , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said he had shot on someone , and killed any one . &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency center that police officers must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house , but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb did not give an explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note Lamb 300 miles went to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were ring@@ ing him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities announced on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een who had been married for about seven years , described as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolute best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to the statement by L@@ ins@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb have called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University , as his curriculum vit@@ ae on the university &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also claims to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly calls for its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the Euro@@ wings low @-@ cost figures .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution margin of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa will not be responsible for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings low cost airline should be developed as independent as possible .
Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt responsible for Euro@@ wings will in future be responsible for Chief Carsten Spo@@ hr .
&quot; in the future , Spo@@ hr under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective agreement with the pilot agreement cock@@ pit ( VC ) , negotiations will be res@@ um@@ ed after the strike on Thursday . &quot;
that shared the union with .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement provisions for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit wants to come to viable results as soon as possible . &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes over the past few months .
&quot; in addition to the transi@@ tional supply of the pilots , the background is the Spar@@ concept &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
it is fores@@ een that the Lufthansa co@@ operates in the fight against competitors routes to the group &apos;s own Bil@@ li@@ ais@@ le Euro@@ wings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
&quot; while this brought the left foreign defender to we@@ eping and exp@@ elled him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give the hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack of Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was introduced into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double bass action and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operates in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , has it very difficult and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape from a red map and the fate of an El@@ f@@ metre .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not pen@@ alize the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack on both legs .
&quot; a tweet at Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
Manchester United to suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the Angl@@ o @-@ American Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland @-@ Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball coming in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital after a b@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a matter that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental bill published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph where Cameron suppos@@ edly describes the plot of the book , instead recre@@ ates an index of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of the city of Th@@ ing @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted is hoping to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ing @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row to a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ person said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s elec@@ toral bure@@ au .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; pushing in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re who has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid himself , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this related message : Adam Ly@@ th leaves from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ ers are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he will make further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance . &quot;
&quot; the UK @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude even though he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one could rise was that England was first defeated Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean , but this lost opportunity now lies in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I treasure highly . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season early when he was 236 vs us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to make mos@@ ques beside cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and would receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and that left @-@ h@@ edge has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s claw of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques perhaps did not get his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before joining Open@@ er in 2001 .
he has made three hundred R@@ uns straight away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari enters the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he was very impressed as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inning opponents who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some wise additions to the trainer &apos;s staff . &quot;
&quot; appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ st , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a coup . &quot;
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate near Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I do not have a problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = UK &apos;s exit from the EU ) could win in Zul@@ u if the economy is in a sl@@ ur@@ ry until 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced new strategy to hold Britain in the EU will go deeper into trouble with every day , even without choosing the genius of Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was severely dist@@ ressed because of Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at was recently told that some member states , so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises as the EU is now and not always out of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contract changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to them whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years , and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande is looking at his re@@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ur@@ king force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will pull a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally do not plan helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press zone as they did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade Ban@@ ana &quot; &quot; Brussels Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in all his restra@@ int , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acked foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners , most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about it , but noticed that when you &apos;re sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage you better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ zers than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s referendum , as Bla@@ ir had opposed the adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened him a backdoor . &quot;
the press never gave it to him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly rap@@ es@@ eed on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time to waste my boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take but it must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ set@@ tee left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it in a friendly way - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blad@@ der@@ wra@@ ck tendency and the wild fav@@ ors of Tor@@ ys Klein Engl@@ ish@@ men can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs had fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ nell is a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s , when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet @-@ mates without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said still what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties according to all reports on their release on Monday evening .
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the social media Stru@@ cture , a Brut@@ stätte of Par@@ ano@@ ia and Ver@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , allowing him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tist dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities as Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try , in all , a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ str@@ au@@ tical voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminis@@ cent of British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum at the start on Monday . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) followed Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health United Kingdom ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the loading capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; on which p@@ he justified his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims were based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who have been conven@@ ed to create a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to give their opinions about the damages caused by various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously been given by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also signed BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding which he report@@ edly received from the Tob@@ acco company Philip Morris International was added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of p@@ he took part .
&quot; the research work of the Group is &quot; &quot; signed &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage to most of the products on most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of p@@ he that &quot; there have so far been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes could serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well@@ being at p@@ he said that BM@@ J was already re@@ acting on the claims of BM@@ J . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking .
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people annually die of a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; the clear provision of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs , probably seen by a smaller audience , in highly controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC &apos;s Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee in the context of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fees , what I don &apos;t think about a good idea in the medium term or long term , you should at least give your production to programs that others don &apos;t do or commissioned . &quot;
&quot; they send the Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am eager to see how this should be public broadcasting .
I don &apos;t think this would l@@ essen the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , proposed that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ cal programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they perform their tasks and they can argue that if they are on their apparent missions for justification of 4 billions of broadcast fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; for the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think that you get a great value for $ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that BBC should check out its Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio , and it should take an example to inform , educ@@ ate and chat about the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliance alli@@ ances to make it available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically modified ne@@ ural systems that can be controlled by qu@@ arri@@ es of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment when they are heard with sound impulses , which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard . &quot;
&quot; impulses are imp@@ acted by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane @-@ channels , which react to ultrasound waves . &quot;
read more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depth of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure which ab@@ duct electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microsc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves affect structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are associated with such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the worms so that some of their motor neur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ization channels . &quot;
&quot; when he uses ultras@@ on@@ ically to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed motor neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that has to be sent down to the desired location in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily pr@@ one the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dwell@@ ings
&quot; eleven years ago I went to a student residence in a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lang@@ at@@ y complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into the student residence ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ ew : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , where and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate it because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were fir@@ mer and these fire extingu@@ ishers were . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people are often transformed into drinks recep@@ tions , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people tigh@@ ten and their under@@ wear put on . &quot;
related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receives a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for anyone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I spent for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos cli@@ pping : do it .
a guy in my student homes had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship by baking .
&quot; as you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have you baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
&quot; badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat mean that people are sleeping when you drop . &quot;
to steal food is a common crime in student dwell@@ ings .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ a@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced as my room@@ mate who added her milk a dish@@ washing agent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is in jail .
they should not make noise that prevents people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the true sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neigh@@ bors , whether it makes them a bit qui@@ eter , because it &apos;s three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted to this with more loud music .
&quot; when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbor to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the contrary , it wouldn &apos;t be utterly embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , get rid of them , dis@@ connect and then see them every day and maybe experience how they bring together all shared friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart enters his own ways - but if a hot fellow @-@ room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a bit of reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone leaving his keys in his not closed room , the border between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good tri@@ ck@@ ery is funny , but it takes only moments , until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety , you never miss anyone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door , and place your keys into a glass of water which you then place in the freezer - but do not t@@ ack their poss@@ essions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;

thousands of refugees are displaced to the housing market .
&quot; the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know , how quickly favourable living space can be created : it builds in a project row housing for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , a lot of refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or turn@@ tables has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a great deal here .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different if one sub@@ stitutes the people in bar@@ racks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for each four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
how much are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
construction lasted for six months .
this is appropriate .
have the construction rules complicated their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : bau@@ ri@@ ently , I have carried out my project correctly . &quot;
especially complicated makes it always the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ Ord@@ in@@ ance .
gre@@ y@@ ish .
&quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three flats in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the towns the place is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were those , who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what definitely is not right .
but are you not tigh@@ tening the competition for affordable apartments ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true is : we had a boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built in luxury apartments that hardly could afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot;
I show how to build a cheap and well @-@ priced today .

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; in the fight for the World Championship title , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the World Cup runner said before the start to the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner champion ahead of the night race in Singapore on this Sunday of defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
&quot; the Brit@@ on has won seven of the twelve races so far , winning the Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite in the city state . &quot;
2009 and last year the 30 year old Br@@ ite was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still un@@ clear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks and thus increased the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the sponsor of the German Uni@@ fied Cross 1st Class and honorary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ kamp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which Chairman Alfred Klein accepted . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot impose the membership fee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be promoted . &quot;
Gau@@ sel@@ mann wants the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ Wh@@ ites &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ des have joined forces under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened up a new location at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
&quot; in addition to consult@@ ations , one can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
a new district office recently opened there .
&quot; here , directly next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as care insurance or services of the health care and care insurance companies . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been committed to our out@@ patient care services that often car@@ ers are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; not rarely , many services of the insur@@ ers are not used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new land@@ owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the assistance of Anton@@ isti@@ des and the civil hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers of the Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention , and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; Heike R@@ ie@@ del , CEO of Sal@@ u@@ dis described Heike R@@ ie@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre , both managers see especially in demographic change . &quot;
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual neighbour@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg in the future essential .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district bure@@ au also dedic@@ ates itself to the association agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able soci@@ alizing . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Foundation is making a major contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar surroundings as possible . &quot;
&quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 am . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller to acquire practice Fel@@ ber@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 310@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ber@@ ausen .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf are missing luck : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on October 1st . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ber@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a position in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then it inv@@ ests 310@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the rock formation years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l met , who are currently doing their professional training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was done , I just called it . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old m@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so one was agreed , the gar@@ bage &apos;s bought the house with the practice . &quot;
meanwhile they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed leading emergency doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is committed honorary in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; starting on September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ gen@@ ausen works as a primary doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ istin ) speci@@ alizes in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to be settled as a house doctor . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultr@@ asonic examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ bearing EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage is a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 euros as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; emphas@@ ises Sam@@ ba citizen Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l approximately 2000 patients arrive at the practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , in the North German average spra@@ xis it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor has found himself , she would have gone . &quot;
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk show also still looking forward to familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the rock formations .
&quot; with their f@@ arewell , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the medical doctors have practi@@ sed there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen re@@ members . &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly will feel after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; says the dor@@ mit@@ ory . &quot;
her husband adds : &quot; we have an 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pushed myself before gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to submit an asylum application can also &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people is at the foref@@ ront .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor via the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia we@@ ars &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia has refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia also wanted to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany , and possibly establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; this is how the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not see in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area . &quot;
Windows @-@ 12@@ 54 ( Turkish ) windows @-@ 12@@ 55 ( Hebrew ) windows @-@ 12@@ 56 ( Arabic )
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried to pass the night hours to Tuesday in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby cor@@ n@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles are constantly meeting new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is predominantly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country reck@@ oned with some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there would be buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought immigrants to the Hungarian border , headed by Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to in@@ struct people to adopt certain routes : &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do this ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in any case in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had been travelling all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia around 500 kilometres .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary could indeed come to a somewhat further west . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphasized that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible withdrawal situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot;
&quot; he did not call the details , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; has comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since passed through a good testimony to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ a , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
&quot; the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local ophthal@@ m@@ ological appearance in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is closed , for premature . &quot;
it would not be very high refugee numbers at this time .
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advice to migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute land maps to refugees in which alternative routes are marked through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still not enough min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian war . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region . &quot;
c@@ apping h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who is accused of having given rise to still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire . &quot;
&quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der trading should have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately tra@@ pped , &quot; says it in the SE@@ C announcement . &quot;
the trials against 32 further blame continued in the case .
most of the def@@ endants came from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
&quot; in the district of Mannheim , there is a lively operation around the Mann@@ heimer Par@@ ade@@ platz . &quot;
&quot; people do their concerns , partly quick ped@@ ometer , partly cosy bum@@ bling . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; pul@@ sing , spr@@ inkl@@ ing life with beautiful autumn sunlight and in the middle of four big plates each with the head@@ line &quot; Before I die I want to .... &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid draws attention to its 20th anniversary and is definitely confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by , as well as the voluntary workers . &quot;
&quot; while some pedestri@@ ans spontane@@ ously intervene to chal@@ k and read the phrase &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffer &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the br@@ ink there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that some@@ time the end of this world comes to me , I can live in a responsible way , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ac@@ on@@ ical work Mannheim , which is supported together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband für den E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables is understandable , but it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the topic of death and death was still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years contributed much to the opening of the people . &quot;
an assessment that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the fun@@ eral and fun@@ eral atten@@ dant is one of the honorary members of the first hour .
&quot; confronted by personal experience with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid was looking for volunteers , she immediately reported and had been present in the establishment in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; I see life from another commodity , keep it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and sec@@ t@@ arian .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of the death and fun@@ eral atten@@ d@@ ants .
training is offered for new employees every two years .
&quot; the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also there , other personal desires can be recorded on post@@ cards . &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016 &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered his outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire around 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this point last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell below 2.5 percent in the market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year that will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January , despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ transpor@@ ting heavy and large packages which are raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said , however , that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and growth in online commerce . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has &quot; &quot; solid earnings &quot; &quot; when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than the Riv@@ alen UPS , which plans to employ 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour forces , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , ending on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex served USD 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked analysts predicted . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion euros .
&quot; six of Z@@ acks asked analysts to be $ 12,@@ 23 billion . &quot;
Fed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international ranking in recent years which brought sales to stagn@@ ation in its unit of express shipment .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales in bo@@ d@@ transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was mainly flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares plum@@ met@@ ed by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras Ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the Lei@@ tz@@ in for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; threatening over them at an end of the complicated , two @-@ storey seat of seats is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. jobs and prices here remain stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . on Thursday , it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data in the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could be anxi@@ ous to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and even if it is only one quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they are observing , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is unsure of itself the financial market . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets expect F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts dimin@@ ish the impact by promising that a further increase is far removed . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Me@@ an increased by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest increase would put down the financial markets because they would remove uncertainty as to when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on good ways to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , she expected more economic progress , an increase in the stat@@ ute expected . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slo@@ wed down in August , improving on the labour market this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly running under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist of Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world gathered at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Me@@ al Value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors were afraid that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered a bit this month , whereas the Dow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence complex calculation when one should raise interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
&quot; now , he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the effect better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be technically included in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years was enormous .
&quot; the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , dis@@ b@@ anded confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;
&quot; acqu@@ er , voted member of the Federal Open Market Committee , ple@@ dged to increase interest rate , quoted rul@@ ings in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower their Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; Lack@@ er said . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the most recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she is afraid of interest raising because the markets are exciting , &quot; P@@ osen said , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should be ahead of time . &quot;

Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric company Rio Grande improves diet for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pap@@ al organization Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women in sho@@ cking fashion how important good nutrition is during lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted on breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , revealed that a healthy diet is actually affecting the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gym@@ nasi@@ um construction on Bern@@ ina &apos;s sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest joint meeting the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously approved .
&quot; previously , the committee had , among other things , approved an application for a &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; of the valid cultivation plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was permitted for a special form with regard to the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background , the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations is : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it was again the roof til@@ lage , which for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - should lie under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus considerably reduced .
&quot; this is why a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was necessary because the construction plan had no &quot; exceptions &quot; with regard to the roof til@@ lage - with the Bern@@ ina community in general in the case of deliver@@ ance contracts rather restri@@ ctive . &quot;
&quot; this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um construction at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
the costs of around 2.3 million euros are calculated .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre high hall will now be submitted to the Federal Council for testing . &quot;

&quot; the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
&quot; the station , as well as the majority of the employees , move from Pei@@ enn@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will apply to the Supervisory Board and the day on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in Pei@@ tsch@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the remaining inner stop .
the rooms are available .
&quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim a workplace is to be offered in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead on 1 October and exchange with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in any case yield an &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ al@@ ises in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree on both houses , until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current renovation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed . &quot;
&quot; Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , advis@@ es that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ wehr , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say that there were several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a psychiat@@ ry clinic are accommod@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer on the quasi @-@ move to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which Fischer worked as head doctor for more than 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague to take over the post of the Director &apos;s Director .
&quot; the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened with closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;

refugees need accommodations : study war@@ ns against house@@ war@@ es
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable residence .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er Housing Construction Association &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; compared to this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are ready in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an accommodation . &quot;
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the ten@@ ants .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is pushing a deficit in front of itself , increasing from year to year . &quot;
&quot; in the metrop@@ olitan areas already around 77@@ 0,000 units were missing , Matthias Günther lam@@ ents , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many working people lived in big cities into shared rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed invol@@ un@@ tarily longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of their lau@@ te on the housing market .
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives are to boost social housing development again . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the gross value tax could be disp@@ ens@@ ed and the land tax for subsidi@@ zed homes may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the alliance . &quot;
the funding program for refugee assistance from the Kf@@ W state bank is already well received by towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , with 184 million euros , more than half of the available 300 million euros was launched on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia have a corridor
&quot; after Hungary , practically no traffic is coming , since more and more refugees pick up the way through Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the way through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and when necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen area .
EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws that came into force on the same day , moreover , practically superf@@ lu@@ ous ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees do not come across border f@@ ences . &quot;
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance is intended to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , however , little more refugees arrive after the border closes . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 36@@ 6 armed people .
&quot; shortly before the gate closes on Monday , it had been 93@@ 80 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws stages the over@@ coming and damage of the border za@@ us as a crime .
&quot; in the south @-@ Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 pen@@ alties were initiated . &quot;
the condemned drug sentences up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ visions &quot; established at the border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stayed there . &quot;
&quot; practically nobody , however , has a prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers should be depor@@ ted there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they collected rub@@ b@@ ish that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
&quot; lock@@ able lat@@ ches were disman@@ tled , and one of the detention centres in the border area was rebuilt . &quot;
no one wanted to express himself about the aim of this conversion .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria remains only few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; about the 20,000 migrants , however , still held up in the country according to government information . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees meet regularly . &quot;
Mayor drove the border over the border
&quot; we were occupied after the bridge festival on Sunday with the clearing up when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pas@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly closed the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the frames with two other hel@@ pers and their cars were ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red across the border into the Middle Pas@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we had the unexpected guests only once again , with snack and drink . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Pas@@ sau by car . &quot;
&quot; that was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train to Pas@@ sau in Wels after the short notice that the rail traffic was shut down to Germany , but still to try to cross the border . &quot;
but the regional train was turned off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing generally is high in the course .

that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án &apos;s sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has officially transferred the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states in the border areas . &quot;
&quot; even the refugees will have to find that the &quot; blessed land , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; there will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 3@@ 5,000 winter @-@ proof quarters &quot;
Konrad made all hands full of refugees in order to deliver refugees .
Christian Konrad used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quot@@ as for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos at the train@@ ee centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot;
&quot; the lodging of the 20,000 refugees , who had come to Austria on Monday , was without great vor@@ ti@@ ces , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master@@ stroke . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad pays for 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 units will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is no bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the people of the country .
they would have assured him of creating lod@@ gings even for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; Ferry Ma@@ ier said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; in the morning , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to clarify how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordin@@ ator also puts great expectations in the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping like us &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily provide accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in emer@@ gen@@ cies , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors have to hold a certain height of the towel rail or the size of the overhead light . &quot;
&quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
Konrad based his experience in contrast to the Interior Ministry .
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , which one does not say without another in the face of un@@ truth . &quot;
conviction is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic any cost as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
the search for his own arti@@ ll@@ ery has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container on Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz is calling for a better division
first no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , because those affected are currently unable to accommodate these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
critic@@ ising the head of the city on the division of refugees inside the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
&quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) took the further action in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the rest of the EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Austria is now taking control of its borders again , is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger as a logical consequence of the actions of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial row is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the stock @-@ listed IT company S &amp; T has been incorporated , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the field of technology . &quot;
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D CEO Hannes Nieder@@ hauser . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in startup companies of the new ship@@ yard , and later also to acquire them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ hauser expects a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; Euro &amp; T invested 1.7 million euros in the plant , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building has been le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to move the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she has grown up in the form of a further business district . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags by the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
&quot; before that , several weeks have been re@@ mod@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; but I have thought for a long time , whether I should open a store , &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Linz Europe , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been given away from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I am very de@@ pl@@ eted when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women are looking for a nice hand@@ bag in a tran@@ ce , the expert will not be able to answer with the last certainty . &quot;
maybe it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag of each outfit is upgraded .
the car @-@ car from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Palat@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose inhabitants are called An@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become US president . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself alien , repor@@ ters are concerned or kno@@ wled@@ geable in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the President &apos;s office s@@ wir@@ ls strongly in the election campaign . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also recorded in the Palat@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire descend . &quot;
the New Yorker with the hair@@ style hair@@ style is a term for many in the win@@ emaking village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related to him over sixty corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del fil@@ med a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has fil@@ med an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous young sho@@ ots , alongside Tr@@ ump , the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; for the king of the heart , he did not bring it there . &quot;
&quot; there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
notice that it is not posible to insert more than one slider on the same page .
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
&quot; Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were the first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time , failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Palat@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once he@@ wn down without permission , had explained the director of the Institute for Palat@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , to the start of the film . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contra@@ sts with the occasionally marked statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly spoke about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he pol@@ eds , this is not so like@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz . &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the wine gro@@ wer in retirement not@@ ices the Americans rather than dis@@ soci@@ ates , &quot; he is always so crum@@ bling . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension propriet@@ or Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions , like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which is generally well sanc@@ tioned . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it makes it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing in the US at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ro@@ cker Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;

seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no great shifts in the reviews for Today . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull sm@@ ashed the down@@ fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; Ri@@ val Sunrise , with moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the down@@ fall seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers since sunrise sc@@ ored an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals , compared to Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ s behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last few months .
&quot; in August , Today , an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sunrise took place . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance ran@@ ged between 40,000 and 50.000 . &quot;
&quot; in September sunrise at an average of 34@@ 9,000 visitors to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern this morning @-@ man more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children along New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily beat The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e gave an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia sc@@ ored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was Sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ seat average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the Qu@@ otes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine feel confident that Hot @-@ Seat will ultimately end at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ flow the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the final three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly obviously who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before being made out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally comment on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips tight until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; could their answers to the game destro@@ yer become who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly called themselves - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were fairly compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house @-@ visit last week made her clear that wood was &quot; the one . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten . &quot;

J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a sc@@ ram@@ ble as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ vert at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also into the running game following a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .
&quot; J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first playing area of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian team had hoped for his N@@ FL out@@ debut . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

free voters call for the employment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high refugee number .
&quot; at the beginning of the FW @-@ autumn sage in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and fac@@ tional leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there is no need for new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1,000 additional teachers to preserve the schools in front of collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get classi@@ fications in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Diet of Free Journ@@ alists was held until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , all other main themes were en@@ vis@@ aged . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now also domin@@ ates the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will out@@ source the clo@@ i@@ ster , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as they were during the Yugoslavia Wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to deal with the causes , &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also called for more staff for the administrative court responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the FW @-@ chief critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria decl@@ ines , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the country policy should not fall under the table in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt . &quot;
a long @-@ lasting tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot trial &quot; &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; &quot; at 47 Gym@@ na@@ sien in which an extension of the upper secondary school of three to four years will be tested . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the FW @-@ chief . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want to do so .
free travel around the G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on jumps
the German stock market has shut down a loose and nervous trade course with profits over long distances .
&quot; in the afternoon , a firm start @-@ up of US stock exchanges provided a clear direction that ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upward . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

the Euro Sto@@ xx 50 as the Lei@@ tin@@ dex of the Eurozone declined by 1.01 percent to 320@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also booked the trading places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the US , the Dow Jones index recorded some 1 per cent in the Plus . &quot;
&quot; many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest decision in the US , and also for large appl@@ ause . &quot;
the discussion around the bur@@ dens of the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E temporarily down to a record low and left deep marks at E@@ on .
&quot; according to the &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; the German energy companies are missing 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures listed in the press .
&quot; the share of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; according to this , investors paid little attention to the German chip@@ builder . &quot;
the investments in future @-@ trend w@@ afer technology and the focus on the car market should be paid out .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were again lowered than in the same period of the previous year , such as the industry association AC@@ EA at the launch of the International Motor Show I@@ AA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the paper@@ work of Daimler and BMW shifted by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen benefits were up by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; on the German pension market , the return on stock @-@ listed federal securities fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.50 ) percent . &quot;
the Re@@ x pension index increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9,@@ 55 points . &quot;
&quot; the federal government lost 0,@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4,@@ 11 points . &quot;
&quot; the rate of the euro dropped to $ 1,@@ 12@@ 62 in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; at noon , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to $ 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the dollar thus cost 0,@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0,@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros . &quot;

&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Head of Staff , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and incen@@ diary bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , from which it is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last two weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; it is planned to be a mix of trade , commercial and housing - but there are no specific offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square metre plot in direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; the plan is to use the area for a mix of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
&quot; we wait for appropriate offers , it is called the part of the city . &quot;
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; accordingly , no agreements have been concluded . &quot;

&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who repro@@ ached the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends from the system construction management into the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euros expensive projects have been in the discussion for months .
the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building were sum@@ mon@@ ed by severe reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all other bones . &quot;
&quot; he also fears a number of other project critics that traffic would greatly increase through the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus loads to make it profitable , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; however , what is happening on the well of a h@@ ect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we must have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google announces double donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations because they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who fled Kab@@ ul with her family , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark cab@@ le@@ ways and bus drives , as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately seek help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations available to help refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com / refuge@@ rose to 11 million $ .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many were able to escape from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery may be helpful for slightly over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years following a new study .
it is still too early to say whether obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrition .
&quot; over the years , obesity has been proven to be efficient for treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are regarded as obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital have used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those subjected to this operation decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who were subjected to a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes medical condition dissolved and some 28 % were partially dissolved . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes was reduced to only one percent and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the blood sugar level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent .
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level sank from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher reg@@ ression in BM@@ I ( 7.4 versus 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was with obes@@ e people who under@@ went Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that attempted more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not show an advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease . &quot;
Black@@ stone concluded that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic which is currently being noticed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the flock of her youth for years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück@@ er readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ d and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could place a literary memorial to her native town .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not receive all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Fu@@ ehrer called for an end to violence in the hom@@ el@@ ands of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford that investig@@ ates ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on 11 September and revealed that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used force , and this has ev@@ oked unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centers in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low heavily alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years rose to report the poison control centres from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inten@@ tionally drink while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have suppos@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mouth water to get a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive frag@@ ran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes and orange fragrance that are very attractive for children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 broad@@ ca@@ ster in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children get involved , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four spra@@ yers from after straw@@ berry scent of hand@@ ker@@ chief inf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was brought to an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered drunk in an adult , said Dr Chris R@@ itch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; Na@@ jah out@@ lasted her words , and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room . &quot;
&quot; doctors over@@ looked them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed her head , said R@@ itch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ jah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant products and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; beyond alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died women after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a mort@@ al solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade met in the state of New York to poison her &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police regarded the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; talk &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; during a rear @-@ end carriage between Nordr@@ ing and On Her@@ der , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car was easily injured during a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross @-@ pole towards the round@@ about industrial area , and assumed too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he ran into the rear of an audi@@ torium with his truck and pushed the car onto a Ford Fi@@ esta standing before . &quot;
&quot; in the accident participating vehicles , property damage was caused by about 10,000 euros , the police disp@@ at@@ ched . &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be to@@ wed .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football bore Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here speak not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm gaming , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic struggle has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now has five points lead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; I had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this just like that - but we have to go on .
we really need the support from Celtic because that makes the player better .
standing together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK overall it rises .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the N@@ SC by 5.5 percent as the figures of the Office for National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) showed .
&quot; in the meantime the employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; The long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by injec@@ ting poison@@ ous injec@@ tions . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available than places available , there is a fla@@ w@@ less lot@@ tery taking place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .

&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I am compl@@ aining with her .
&quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; it could have been better phr@@ asing , &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the death penalty . &quot;

&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go to all the details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think its execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other Repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after wet police pursu@@ it persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman was kept dry when he spoke to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer attempting to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was declared a house peace break in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of the Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ have@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
master &apos;s football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he insi@@ sted on the ste@@ wards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria , claiming that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive co@@ bal@@ t test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had with@@ held for 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age charges and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have eaten on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything will come out at once , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to go around the heads raised , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stall . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to grasp me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should that bring me to the view that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L beha@@ ves co@@ war@@ dly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer took up with the long @-@ lasting Kob@@ alt investig@@ ator at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching explained that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack mud or clay had been applied to the horse deb@@ ated , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg .
it could have been like last night .
&quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was also the case . &quot;
but it was also so on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack at the race day . an investigation of this issue has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver cur@@ sed
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a coll@@ ision with a cycl@@ ist and followed by driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries when he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday there was a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged with driver and assistance service and other transport off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals because of claims about tor@@ tur@@ ings
&quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has called on the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites on the N@@ RL . &quot;
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; Ring @-@ fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hard @-@ h@@ opping note about the Storm @-@ Team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
&quot; Bell@@ amy advoc@@ ated the tor@@ ch lim@@ p of his crew , and said that they were only concentr@@ ating on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team makes him confident , because they worried they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; that always appears again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ restling , when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques all year . but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has produced the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to practice . he is probably not accu@@ stom@@ ed to losing so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; soccer . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of himself . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and we consider it exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all its kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play . &quot;
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against Roo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are p@@ auses , and do not score any points of tension ? &quot;
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a single phase . &quot;
the Storm Team released this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; beer with $ 200,000 De@@ posit Bonus &quot;
&quot; a man who could potentially face a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to get possession of 40 kilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants at the marina in the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ lasting penalty for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless cause . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the case of the criminal case he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security jointly offered to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ables of the two people it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security deposit , under the conditions that he cons@@ ents to his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , daily reports to the police and is at a starting block of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s house breaking apart
&quot; during a rear @-@ end carriage with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to escape to the left at the last moment , as the police informed . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab collap@@ sed completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours until 2 am .
&quot; there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 Euro . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used girls phone to enti@@ ce ped@@ oph@@ ile to send pictures
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she fell asleep and went into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; Web research &quot; , &quot; which used terms for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then asser@@ ted to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile in the internet &quot; and he then &quot; proposed to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the sha@@ king and bitter@@ ness . &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , un@@ so@@ lic@@ ited pictures of children on 14 June last year and did not appear to have appeared in court at a hearing on 24 March of this year . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ acy lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his crime . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared the verdi@@ ct by October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was kept in custody on charges of other pending cases . &quot;
he was admitted before the date of judgment in the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user moves to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up apart from the large @-@ scale control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers caused fear of discovery and sei@@ z@@ ure of people increasingly on smaller fron@@ tiers .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the Pas@@ sau and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn districts since Tuesday . &quot;
they had come to the German side by foot on bridges and dam@@ s .
&quot; there they are taken in reception by federal police , and for@@ warded to the registration . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the beginning of the week , the Munich Central Station took a lot more refugees back on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; by 8 : 00 a.m. , around 700 people had arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; following the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached 17@@ 59 refugees on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : prec@@ urs@@ or of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) distributed in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in the first place in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest is still in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Bodensee @-@ circle with gu@@ sts between 60 and 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the high@@ ways show their new products at the I@@ AA .
&quot; in 2015 , it is especially important to see the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot;
cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ str@@ ations were dropped by the Federal Office ( KBA ) in August alone in August .
this is also reflected at the I@@ AA ( public holidays 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concepts and new high @-@ class and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand by dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is launching an entry below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , starting at EUR 17 650 . &quot;
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant I will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade it comes at the beginning of next year , and then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan tra@@ cker wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact infin@@ ity with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , who is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specification .
the start of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact version model DS 4 , which can be seen at the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers were especially hands on the front part : the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ designed and the modified head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch@@ screen and integrated for the first time at Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on the I@@ AA in the compact class , a series of re@@ visions and new variants like the un@@ folded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;

&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Judi@@ cial Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were confined to narrow spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with approximately five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his ten@@ ure of office because of the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied conditions of detention against the land of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re @-@ trial . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity seriously injured .
Court judgment now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the question@@ able period only a few days of o@@ at age for compensation was decisive , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
so they talked to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was naked in a prison cell .
&quot; un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to 2011 , the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff had been accommod@@ ated every day between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons were also in the head@@ lines due to lack of staff . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , prisoners are tra@@ pped again and again 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to bat man@@ ners it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information provided by the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle there are 21 places in Te@@ gel not busy due to the offspring shortage , 19 should exp@@ ire 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating that
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is capable of recording a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated decisi@@ veness in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do it . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses between 350,000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and over the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all in affordable rental objects : 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing accounts out of the rental price binding every year and for these particularly favourable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Minister of Building Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing projects have to be produced every year , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.4 billion a year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister of Building Reports agree that there will also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( IAB ) , it is assumed that 55 per cent of poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the Society of Rec@@ ording , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , &quot; says Mig@@ rant researcher Dietrich Colonel hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ ill@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognize labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was a prohibition of employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residen@@ cy , the asylum seek@@ ers were confined to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the visibility is mostly made clear that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
lack of knowledge of German is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
&quot; so far , there is not yet a sufficient range of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the build @-@ up of networks is therefore the King &apos;s path to work integration according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt &apos;s view .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the rooted parents , it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ lers in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators to increase strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more technical schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared for classes without knowledge of German in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always instruc@@ ted by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 per cent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no Bundes@@ land does not prohi@@ bit asylum seek@@ ers or atten@@ de@@ es - the only exception was Berlin , but the internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned his attitude . &quot;
willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a refund or Dul@@ ce do not receive services according to the asylum authority law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g as they do not fall under the circle of the allowed people . &quot;
&quot; so far , tolerated refugees had to have been living in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span is shor@@ tened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , this financing gap must also be closed , ask Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and religion is an important part of their identity for many . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually grant the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop new state religions . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options . &quot;
&quot; to this end , there is also a willingness to take part in fundament@@ alism against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be applied to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to discharge such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future .
&quot; as a result , the majority society will also have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more pressing . &quot;
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination function and a general gender equality law for a decade .
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NSU @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist pattern . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunity for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have been demanding for a long time , and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany need to become reality in the coming years , if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing medical services to the previously expected refugees , colum@@ ned Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ power and capacities , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be incorporated into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to the registration of health cards . &quot;
services rendered could later be rep@@ uted with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to send as many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er law prescri@@ bes . &quot;
otherwise the doctors will mainly make the language barriers .
&quot; so far , the Berlin Health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are better informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in hospitals , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs need to be taken over , she demands . &quot;
it would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic look .
&quot; among the refugee cad@@ res , there are clearly more un@@ affected han@@ di@@ caps , and with the young people it is about HIV clari@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other path@@ ologies , German doctors came from her education but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; par@@ asi@@ tism , or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees even have doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and take ex@@ ams . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ically ill following estimates of the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; it is particularly vulnerable to refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study conducted by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee crisis is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart @-@ pac@@ ed and de@@ ar@@ est . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms include sleep and lack of concentration , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms of chronic disease , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although mentally ill seek@@ ers in the welfare departments can apply for psych@@ otherapy , however , the treatment usually lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , dropped by a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ g@@ ations by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ph@@ ons .
&quot; last month , they had dismis@@ sed him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politi@@ cian received text messages on their phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the members of Parliament that the immun@@ ity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard intends to reduce 25,000 @-@ 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , which will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses supporting businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as a stand @-@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such as an explanation of the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in order to produce electrical installations and their Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring process to exit from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates must face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and provided his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his story , his participation in the next summer is still uncertain . &quot;
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ eas@@ on .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that healed not well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in contact with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries he had before . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player attempts to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger faces a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with Ki@@ er@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to give a little break , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although ar@@ sen@@ al are clear favour@@ ites to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is of the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven away from far @-@ away hope with his management to lead the association to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ feast : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now become more desperate than ever before , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the issue , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m Camp@@ aig@@ n against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 announced the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a current study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extra tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the nice thing with friends was that this focus was placed on my head .
&quot; every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the football club in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross after Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to each case , even though they often hold back to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of phone past@@ oral care I explained : ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and endangered by themselves , has shown me really clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when one speaks about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much my objective out@@ si@@ ders status about the telephone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ feast coming to the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give it a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ feast
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani considered course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria took less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on his way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani sc@@ ored a head@@ ball@@ tor at the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since it does not only aim the qualification for the kno@@ ck rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with whom he began his illu@@ stri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to create 2 : 0 to cause problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t sc@@ ored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team that was able to hold a 2 : 2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was referred to as the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , and he indicated why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat &apos;s pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense , before joining Johan Wil@@ and , he ended up in the long corner of the net . &quot;
&quot; however , if one believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off hit to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field str@@ ung a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes pointed out , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scra@@ pped in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ... &quot;
the second goal finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c ple@@ aded a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ low to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before replacing a substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualification games are not sufficient . &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
&quot; the local mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , based in Switzerland , who is affected by collap@@ sing commodity prices , collected 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday as part of its huge debt recovery plan . &quot;
&quot; the Gl@@ enc@@ ore company , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds in order to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value in this year , is struggling with falling raw material prices since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of reference right brought Glen@@ n &apos;s stock exchange rate at the early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange .
&quot; the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; last week , Gl@@ enc@@ ore announced the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to rep@@ ay around a third of its 30 billion $ debts . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new hol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 per cent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding a long @-@ term sustained growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by roughly half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and said President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosted by Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two state leaders have bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President &apos;s visit will offer the opportunity to expand the American @-@ China cooperation in a series of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi will give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , initially announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber @-@ spi@@ on@@ age China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi played for the Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern obviously stood in front of the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which at that time played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champi@@ ons , four times Champions League winner , twice world champion , twice European champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he was standing before the European Cup before the European departure from Barcelona . &quot;
I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rou@@ man@@ ia wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi moved not
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive guy is working for the German record champion today : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I &apos;ve played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria about the entire distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end of the royal class triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays host in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion of the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke out as this acc@@ entu@@ ated the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it when filling the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with in@@ war@@ dly dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ish brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to handle the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a groove that is beaten by her white nec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for shooting rights in the film , Dam@@ on answered that their direc@@ ting &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the Twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the foref@@ ront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager , Michael Brown was killed by a white police in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement sc@@ ored a country @-@ wide effect and pushed law@@ makers and authorities to discri@@ min@@ ating practices against colour co@@ hesi@@ on . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media mo@@ ors who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; cro@@ wned first champion
professional sports clim@@ bers and aid workers Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing is part of a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the ti@@ ring Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenging three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard fought victory , still under shock about winning the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or have had life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot;
suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money . &quot;
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changed the life he receives the great sati@@ ation .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any gru@@ dge over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received numerous awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac should have felt as if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for an eight season , the fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past , they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last square in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , however , on Tuesday they played perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the Tw@@ ins lost a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so difficult for a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad P@@ itch . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scores three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strong , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen any game , and therefore I want to go to the game very concentrated . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle mar@@ in@@ ator on July 6th .
&quot; he has curved the wood well , &quot; said m@@ ali@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better in the bul@@ l@@ pen and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inside , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a cra@@ yon , and Simon introduced his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy went off the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run crack in the right @-@ handed la@@ w . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run , the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe introduced the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe defeated a double play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner , Wall cleared a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and sc@@ ored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ h@@ ander , however , stood S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava . &quot;
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the vulner@@ ability list in front of the game after he had been missing for more than one month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better when I started and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter first , Hus@@ him gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which made a single up the middle class at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers laid in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit particularly well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , sc@@ ored no points in the third inning , before being replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .
comments : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing lessons .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the S@@ hou@@ l@@ der from San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of shoulder @-@ sh@@ red@@ ding , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to fight the Tw@@ ins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he was kid@@ n@@ apped on the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and Tw@@ ins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people involved in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden ex@@ communicated on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an provincial capital had been prepared for this eventu@@ ality in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily sign there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shelter in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures an option in Syria
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds a military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he proposed to the European states &quot; collective way@@ far@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , it was very happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany has passed . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict ends in front of our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington demanded a massive expansion of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; in Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian Television Station ORF , and no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
also Germany did not send any refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , &quot; &quot; I have already given such talks between the General Director for Public Security and Ag@@ ents of Germany . &quot;
she did not call her specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees over the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary came to Austria in the past few days .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach in the crisis . &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee ban in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries with the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , in the late Tuesday evening , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Federal Chanc@@ ell@@ ery in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , ar@@ ouses this too . &quot;
&quot; however , anyone who is not eligible for a stay in Germany could not stay in Germany . &quot;
this view had been divided into the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now master a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could also be tied up with a fence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had pierc@@ ed the fence .
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of migrants in Turkey took their way to the Greek border . &quot;
guest Rooms &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; is located Ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean swe@@ eps . &quot;
these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the moon is stag@@ gering on his or@@ bit around the ring planet . &quot;
&quot; although this de@@ af movement is small but still too large for a continuous solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; specialist sheet .
&quot; last but not least , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in 2006 Cass@@ ini had already discovered Eis@@ volcan@@ oes at the south pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds , the water vap@@ or and iron particles sp@@ ew and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers concluded then . &quot;
&quot; however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München for several weeks
&quot; the 1860 München needs to do without Val@@ det R@@ ama , an offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama . &quot;
an investigation has resulted in an infrin@@ gement of the latter by the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich &apos;s lions , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to break four weeks of compul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; that makes us heavy , R@@ ama is a heart loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a united pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties presented a defensive man initially . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the possibility to prove his ability . &quot; &quot;
tor@@ h@@ unters Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian National Team is to enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had hurt in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent cl@@ ash at the head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line , will often rather fall off from them . &quot;
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. First of all , man@@ goes contain lots of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too firm and pleas@@ antly sm@@ elling . &quot;
the paint alone doesn &apos;t say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to hear@@ ty dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney suits fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;

&quot; first fo@@ ehn storm , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night breaks in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday . &quot;
on Wednesday and in the night of Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n blows some storm strength through the fo@@ ehn .
&quot; after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest exposure . &quot;
&quot; on the mountain@@ ous side , on the night to Wednesday the f@@ öh@@ n breaks through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blows up until Thursday morning in the con@@ cili@@ atory valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also at over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ kan@@ e arches of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , dr@@ yers for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees are concerned , moisture begins to blow at the night@@ fall slope . &quot;
&quot; here , rain stops , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , south of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after already large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the air emerg@@ es , as a result a cold front co@@ ils with powerful , partly we@@ ather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind e@@ ats strong and stor@@ my , and temperatures are going well . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , on the south it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , rec@@ alled that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in sec@@ l@@ usion in the city of Pop@@ es for centuries . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the square will be seen that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a welcome sin @-@ b@@ able .
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare H@@ og@@ an Lov@@ ells
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles , which focus on topics such as cross @-@ road , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ net . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current contex@@ ts .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original scrip@@ ture of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to gain a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant rule of the Lord . &quot;
&quot; then the education took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work , perhaps to wear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help art again in a fast @-@ moving era : &quot; &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today marked by advertisement , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall into the images , let them appear , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the picture looks for his opposite . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; not paying attention to the Bible completely , but also selected for him important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( Bibli@@ cal ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung .

&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;

the football re@@ acts to the p@@ itting situation in Germany and ass@@ ures policy his help in dealing with the pending problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss intensively the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the crucial turn@@ outs must put policy .
&quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some federal lists support this program .
&quot; on this weekend , the 36 professionals will set up a clear sign when they will be able to &quot; &quot; help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; on the left tri@@ kot@@ bu@@ stle instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said Lever@@ k@@ usen sports director Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; matter of course . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the fu@@ gi@@ tive drama goes on everyone , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football Bundes@@ liga , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
&quot; for the Euro @-@ quali@@ fier game against Hungary this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a big collective work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places , be great . &quot;
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association jointly with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will receive 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already rec@@ alled the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : head of SAP loses an eye in the event of an accident
&quot; managing director of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye due to a down@@ fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA , he had fallen into a glass jar after midnight , which he carried in his left hand reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , was power@@ less , then pulled out to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , however , could pursue his work . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again , if you have fallen . &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League finally ended . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the football Bundes@@ liga as well in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 PM / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga top game against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high burden of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel will not only change its tribal position on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the door@@ ke@@ epers .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occup@@ ies the place of master @-@ man Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher pra@@ ises the world champion . &quot;
&quot; whether wil@@ dly f@@ eller arrives in future in all Europe league games , Tu@@ chel however left open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ge statement from Mit@@ gam@@ er Re@@ us that the final decision for the BV@@ B in the Europa League has to be the target , mid @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl holds comprehen@@ sible : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants the pioneering role for Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a pioneer in changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke to Frankfurt on Wednesday at the edge of the International Motor Show I@@ AA from a &quot; New Mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with representatives of industry at the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a fast rise in digital radio communications . &quot;
testing new technology is currently underway on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order for the driver to be br@@ ushed up &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework &quot; and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far been fores@@ een for the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in a matter of seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; despite this , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; are expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot;
&quot; the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site value the authors of the study for 2025 , to some 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD @-@ Transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the drivers &apos; personal data must be clearly explained . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the For@@ sa Institute presented on Wednesday at the AA , commissioned by the Ex@@ amin@@ ants Dec@@ ra , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent count only in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in all at all . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
well every vi@@ ed would leave the car under no circumstances .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant King
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which look horri@@ fying human thanks to video projec@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , has been the great star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
I can &apos;t say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant King of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18th September at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good idea that the fashion designer has changed his post@@ ure to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; For me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Canada &apos;s Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work for which a lot of effort has been carried out : to proc@@ ure the d@@ olls , for example a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot went to Munich for 14 tons of material . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ gy @-@ fashionable side@@ walk of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the e@@ jection of fashion itself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them of course .
for his first own fashion show he could not pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener top as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long stit@@ ching machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers , which they worked on for example to blank@@ ets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ ab@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace appli@@ qu@@ Ã © s in jewellery , with accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is bor@@ rowed to past engra@@ vers , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who don &apos;t use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already have half of all orders . &quot;
mo@@ De@@ en P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken . &quot;
&quot; private specialty shops , and also wholesale distribution , are almost no longer available . &quot;
our products are not yet accessible to customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass @-@ goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains . &quot;
&quot; it also weak@@ est export , currently in Russia and in the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the nitrogen cave in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds , &quot; This refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger branch office of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a field of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; Schmidt says . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter has rev@@ itali@@ zed the historic snow@@ ball tip . &quot;
the machine sti@@ cks small spheres at some places .
&quot; the lau@@ dry gold@@ smith apprenti@@ ce Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; before I could do nothing with traditional P@@ lau@@ er tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process it em@@ bos@@ ses the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and Sur@@ ro@@ undings and who would like to have a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; you shouldn &apos;t touch legends , but Disney still w@@ ills to a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a new film adaptation , but a kind of continuation that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open up wider out@@ wards to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group entrusted with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should be committed to attra@@ cting foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Management Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group adop@@ ts a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border control policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is compiled which identi@@ fies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments . &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance since it assign@@ s to the market a major role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ law business environment and open the market open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to companies and ensure companies decide how to manage their transactions .
the statement also said China will allow borders to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity and advoc@@ ate professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders like Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as reported in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ like limit in car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and to allow consumers a much higher dose of the pesti@@ cide .
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding work paper of the EU , sharp@@ ly critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of a lack of industrial and environmental policy are being passed on with full force on pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mer@@ cury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be imm@@ utable . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU according to Food@@ watch aims to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but Food@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p tend to be so low @-@ loaded , that they already hold the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , sen@@ timent in Kl@@ einf@@ o is &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone &quot; , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans that are heavily enrich@@ ing over the food chain particularly in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; even small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system especially in the case of un@@ born damages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not expected to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury gets into the environment mainly due to coal combustion .
&quot; according to a written information by the German Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations will run more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fishes about the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings of mer@@ cury in fish have already counted among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
