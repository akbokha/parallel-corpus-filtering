&quot; the organization , the community and the states work together , as far as any contrac@@ ting party is concerned to facilitate the implementation of the safety measures provided in this Convention ; they avoid unnecessary dup@@ lication of the security measures . &quot;
&quot; the safety measures provided in this Convention are implemented in such a way that they are not a handi@@ cap for economic and technological development in the community , or for international cooperation in the area of peaceful nuclear activities , including the international exchange of nuclear material ; &quot;
&quot; B ) No un@@ warran@@ ted interference in the peaceful nuclear activities in the community , in particular in the operation of the plants ; &quot;
&quot; C ) in accordance with the practices of a pru@@ dent operating system , as they are required for the economic and practic@@ able implementation of nuclear activities . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation meets all precau@@ tions in order to protect business and industry secrets , as well as other confidential information , of which they obtain knowledge in carrying out this agreement . &quot;
&quot; II ) The information on core material , which is subject to securing measures according to this Convention , can be published on decision of the Council and with the consent of the directly affected states or the community , as far as each of the two contrac@@ ting parties is concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) In carrying out safety measures according to this agreement , technological development is fully charged in the field of securing measures , and all efforts are undertaken to ensure optimum cost effectiveness and application of the principle of effective hed@@ ging monitoring of the flow of core material , which is subject to the use of instruments and other technical procedures at certain strategic points , as far as the current or future technology is possible . &quot;
&quot; B ) To ensure optimal cost effectiveness , for example , the following procedures are applied : I ) spati@@ ally f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ing as a means to determine the material balance zones for the accounting purposes ; &quot;
&quot; III ) Con@@ cent@@ ration of the follow @-@ up procedure to the phases of the fuel cycle , which may affect the production , processing , use and storage of nuclear material from which no further nuclear weapons and other nuclear missiles could be manufactured , and the extent possible restri@@ ction of the follow @-@ up procedure in son@@ stic core materials , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) For effective implementation of the safety measures according to this Convention , the Community of Organisation grants information on core material which is subject to securing measures , and on the features of the systems which are responsible for the implementation of the safety measures relating to this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) i ) The organization requires only the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information about systems are limited to the minimum size , which is necessary for the use of securing measures in relation to core material , which is subject to the safety measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) At the request of the community , the organization is prepared to examine investment data , which respect the community as particularly vulnerable to the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not require the organization to be transferred to the organization , provided they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization fet@@ ches the consent of the Community and the States to the nam@@ ing of insp@@ ectors for the states .
&quot; II ) Incre@@ ases the community either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at any time against a certain designation , the organization of the community and the states proposes one or more alternative names . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the repeated refusal of the community to appro@@ ve the appointment of insp@@ ectors of the organization , which is subject to this agreement , the Council will discuss the refusal by the General Director of the Organisation - in the following as &quot; &quot; General Director &quot; &quot; - with the aim of meeting the appropriate measure . &quot;
B ) The Community and the affected countries are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the organisation &apos;s insp@@ ectors may actually be able to fulfill their tasks according to their agreement .
C ) The visits and activities of the insp@@ ectors of the organisation are set up so that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and dis@@ ruption to the community and the states and for which the peaceful nuclear activities of peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible ;
II ) safegu@@ arding the protection of industrial secrets and other insp@@ ectors of the organisation to inform the relevant confidential information .
&quot; each state is addressing the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to their insp@@ ectors and other officials , to fulfill the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ties of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the safety measures following this agreement are termin@@ ated in relation to core material , if the community and organization determine that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is not usable for a nuclear activity that is under the point of securing the securing measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; the Community has noti@@ fied the organisation according to the Convention on the transfer of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to the safety measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the safety measures following this agreement will be termin@@ ated in relation to core material , as soon as the recipient state , as in this Agreement , has taken responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries out documents , from which any transfer and , if necessary , the re@@ application of the securing measures on the further core material . &quot;
&quot; in the case of non @-@ nuclear activities such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramics , the community agreed with the organisation of such use of material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material being used during the period of non @-@ use of the safety measures according to this Convention is not used to manufacture nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons .
B ) The Organization and the Community agree that the security measures provided in this Agreement should not be applied only as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these securing measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the security measures planned in this Agreement will once again be applied once the core material is re@@ introduced to a peaceful nuclear programme . &quot;
&quot; the organisation is held on the total amount and the composition of this material in the respective state , or the respective countries concerned , and on any passing of such material from this state or the state in the current state . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as swi@@ ft@@ ly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as time and process @-@ sm@@ ashed provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not exclu@@ de any endor@@ sement or a confi@@ denti@@ ality of the military activity and does not refer to the application of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them will grow in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or individuals , are subject to their sovereignty , but exceptional costs as a result of a special investigation of the organization , the organization will rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se these costs as long as they have been en@@ du@@ red in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization is carrying out the costs of all additional measurements and rehear@@ s@@ als required by the organization &apos;s insp@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; the community and states ensure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be entitled to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the States . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or a state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization against the organization or the organization against the community or a state is responsible for damage , with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident , is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; the advice given to him by the General Director suggests that the organization is not able to ensure that no core material that must be subject to securing measures , for nuclear weapons or other core embr@@ yo@@ s , will be able to equi@@ p the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ ute , and if necessary , the other measures should be taken . &quot;
&quot; such steps take into account the Council , in which mass was acquired by the applied securing measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contrac@@ ting parties is concerned - any reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organisation , the community or the state , consult@@ ations are conducted on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to ask that questions , which arise from the interpretation or application of this Agreement , shall be examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes relating to Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be submitted to a party to an arbit@@ ral tribun@@ al , which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the States ap@@ point two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four named arbit@@ rators elect a fifth one who leads the presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; if the community and the States or the organization have not been named two arbit@@ rators in three days after the request for an arbit@@ ral tribun@@ al , the community or organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is applied if within three days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbit@@ rator , the fifth arbit@@ rator has not yet been elected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the Arb@@ it@@ ration Court is competent , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the resolutions of the Arb@@ it@@ ration Court are binding for the organization , the community and the affected countries . &quot;
&quot; a ) This agreement occurs for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contrac@@ ting party of the contract and become members of the Community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is noti@@ fied that its procedures are concluded for the force of this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; II ) If the organization of the organization noti@@ fies , that it is able to apply its securing measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the States consult each other on request of one of the Parties to a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Director teaches all member states of the organization immediately of any change in this Agreement .
&quot; a ) This agreement occurs on the day when the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures are concluded for the entry into force . &quot;
B ) This agreement remains as long as the states contrac@@ ting party of the contract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Agreement &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this section of the Convention is to determine the procedure required in carrying out the provisions of the Part I on securing measures , as required . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the safety measures set in this Convention is the timely discovery of the extraction of significant amounts of core material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such degradation by the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the verification by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which material quantity is not specified for a certain period of time specified for a specific period of accuracy for the specified seas . &quot;
&quot; in the implementation of their veri@@ fications , the organization is responsible for article 3 full use of the f@@ use system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of its securing measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind of use , and they , as far as necessary , will proceed as far as necessary , as they are near@@ er to the suppl@@ ementary agreements and are pur@@ pos@@ eful : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of received , produced , lost , lost or in other way out of the stock of core materials and stock quantities ; &quot;
B ) assessment of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of transm@@ it@@ ters and recei@@ vers ; &quot;
e ) procedure for evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and report system , which indicates the core material stock and the changes in the material balance , including the one and out of the material balance zone ; &quot;
&quot; g ) precau@@ tions , ensuring that accounting procedures and agreements are correctly carried out ; &quot;
h ) procedure for reporting of reports to the organization in line with articles from 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
&quot; the safety measures , according to this agreement , do not extend to material in mining or ore processing . &quot;
&quot; B ) is ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , which is not yet reached in the states , the community of the organisation divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material which is suitable according to composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ opic enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit produced in the states , so it is subject to the safety measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The security measures provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the conditions mentioned in article 11 are not possible or desirable , the community must consult the organization and the community on the application of appropriate security measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The security measures provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ profit . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures following this agreement : &quot;
a ) particular sp@@ litt@@ able material when used in gram or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is appropri@@ ated , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with an is@@ ot@@ opic concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation liber@@ ates nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , provided that the entire , liber@@ ated core material quantity in the states is not at any time . &quot;
&quot; a ) a total of a kil@@ ogra@@ m of particular p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; II ) Uran@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates through multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates through multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and aged ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of ri@@ pen@@ ed ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; liber@@ ated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material which is subject to the safety measures according to this Convention , so precau@@ tions for the use of the securing measures are met on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization suppl@@ em@@ ental ab@@ duc@@ tions , which are necessary in the scope that is necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the Organisation according to this Convention , in particular , as defined in the procedures set in the Convention . &quot;
the suppl@@ ementary agreements can be extended or altered without change of this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the suppl@@ ementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force . the organization , the community and the States undertake all efforts to force these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report in Article 62 , the organization is based on the core material included in Article 62 , ir@@ respective of its origin , and leads to this inventory of records on the basis of the following reports and the results of their follow @-@ up examinations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ration problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and Member States that the whole of the Member States is bound to force the agreement within six months , and as far as possible within two years after entering into force in form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consult@@ ed each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ WG has submitted a table for which they intend to apply the criteria set in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organization alig@@ ns a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special action account &quot; &quot; which will contribute to the member states according to this agreement to the special action account ; this account is governed by the organization as administrator of tre@@ u@@ der@@ ous and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special action account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ conditional promis@@ sory note of the member state , to pay on request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as ste@@ wards of the special action account , and to be depos@@ ited in the organisation of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , and i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entering into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed upon ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another point , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every member state may request the payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedure of the organization , the administrator takes approximately propor@@ tion@@ ate cuts to the cash or the school jun@@ ta to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special action account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in case of mal@@ nutrition of these loans , the administrator can lead to the conditions of the E@@ EC of the following factors : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit absorption capacity to loan conditions without any dis@@ adv@@ anta@@ geous ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan is the financing of a clearly defined and rapidly pay@@ able development programme ( including a sect@@ oral presentation ) , which is independent of whether it is a loan programme of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that are finan@@ cially funded by the organization . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special action account may not be used instead of regular means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same refund policies which are generally considered by the organization ; they are thus rep@@ ay@@ able for ten years in a 50 @-@ year period . &quot;
&quot; special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are pay@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
payments accepted by this seller ( not translated by The Cube Realty )
&quot; each special transaction loan is provided by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the means . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from each special transaction loan can be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country , or for goods or services ( ii ) in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization , and which , according to the discretion of the supervis@@ or at the time of loan granted , could be recipients of a special action loan . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans are carried out on the special action account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is as soon as possible by the administrator to the respective member state . &quot;
the administrator has instruc@@ ted the E@@ EC to complete all the special transaction loans by the directors in preparation and via the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
&quot; during the period of payment of the special transaction loan , the supervis@@ or supervis@@ es the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses related to it . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the administrator will send a detailed account of the special action account with a statement by the external audi@@ tor of the organisation to this account . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC immediately sends a detailed report on the plans and programmes financed by the special shareholder loan . &quot;
&quot; the administrator has created and carries out appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special action account , which have been allocated to the account received from the accounts recei@@ vable and the payments received from the account received from the account and payments to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to the full edition of the special action account of time to time provide a exchange of ideas about the status of the special action account , the progress of programmes financed through special action plans , and beyond any other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on December 31 , 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organization should agree upon , have not entered into force , so the agreement and all the obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and transferred to Member States , this agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; this agreement requires approval by the individual member states , and the E@@ EC according to the legal provisions of each party . &quot;
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fied the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned .
&quot; the Secretary General accepts these Noti@@ fications , along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper auth@@ orization of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will be effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of the notification of the noti@@ fications in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is framed in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
&quot; in consideration that the agreement is concluded in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of the App@@ endi@@ ces A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - HA@@ S FO@@ L@@ GEN@@ DE VER@@ OR@@ DN@@ ATION , ER@@ LA@@ SS@@ EN : &quot;

&quot; - fresh or cooled Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina following the community are set to the following annual quantity : 20,000 tons , expressed in slaughter body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure a faul@@ t@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina committed to ensure that the actual amount will not exceed the agreed amount and executed according to conventional offer ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the above number 10 mentioned above , in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; for the case that the community takes care of the protection clause , it is obliged to ensure that the access to Argent@@ inian access to the community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;

&quot; an anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ undation of A1 and A2 blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required when the same attempts are carried out with the re @-@ resolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of the same activity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed with a similar amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required , if the same attempt at the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a standard prepar@@ ate of the same avi@@ dity is performed . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ undation of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ R@@ h Blood @-@ group sera of each species can belong to one of two species , which are distinguished by the conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in other words , ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods . &quot;
&quot; some &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on object carriers as well as hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are in@@ hibited in their own ser@@ um or plasma . &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may change if international standard prepar@@ ates are available ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
&quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , imm@@ uni@@ zed by the tigen D of the R@@ h system . &quot;
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the tigen D . &quot;
complete &quot; Anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ zer of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0,@@ 9 % cooking salt solution . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ sol@@ dered , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative test compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the tigen D , the ser@@ um should react with blood cells that contain do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which is intended for use of object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must be filled with a similar amount of a 40@@ - to 50 % in@@ undation of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C ser@@ um is derived from the blood of one or more persons affected by the ag@@ glut@@ ino@@ gen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ds of human red blood cells containing the tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
this Ser@@ a is therefore only specific for C @-@ an@@ tigen only if the tested blood cells are in@@ hibited in a 0,@@ 9 % salt solution . &quot;
the title of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which is intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not included in the form of anti @-@ D ) , must be a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ E ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , imm@@ uni@@ zed by the tigen E of the R@@ h system . &quot;
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a titanium of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which is intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not included in any form anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
&quot; sera the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D , anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E ser@@ um . &quot;
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies must be effective at the same time , among the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time in all kinds of red blood cells that show a reaction may not be less than with the ant@@ ec@@ tile antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A ser@@ um is derived from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances in the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing A @-@ An@@ tigen , that is the ones of blood groups A and AB including sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inate no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ An@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ resolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ ate of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative test , separated with floo@@ ds of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a similar amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur at any in@@ undation within the double time required when the same attempt with the re @-@ resolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ ate of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a standard prepar@@ ate of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;

&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing B @-@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ inate no human red blood cells that do not contain B @-@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ resolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ ate of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative test , with a flood of blood cells of the group B ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a similar amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required when the same attempt with the re @-@ resolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ ate of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard prepar@@ ate of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;

&quot; based on the common declaration adopted by the Ministers of EF@@ TA Countries and the Member States of the Community , as well as by the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 , in particular with regard to a simpli@@ fication of the limits of border and country of origin , &quot;
&quot; as of January 1 , 1988 , the Community within the Action Programme decided to introduce a unified administration paper on the internal market , as of January 1 , 1988 , in order to strengthen the internal market . &quot;
&quot; in THE estimate that it is appropriate to simpli@@ fy the transport of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , especially through the introduction of a unified management api@@ ece . &quot;
&quot; in THE estimate , that this agreement must not be interpreted as a result of its obligations arising from other international agreements . &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simpli@@ fy the transport of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries . &quot;
&quot; the transport between the contrac@@ ting parties , which are connected between the contrac@@ ting parties , are provided by a single paper to use the pattern according to the samples in App@@ endix I to this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; according to the case , the Single Document is used as a registration or paper for export , shipping method or import . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out the legal provisions applicable in a contrac@@ tual party , whose application would not be guaranteed with any use of the uni@@ formity documents ; &quot;
&quot; - to be requested by the participants , so that they may be able to take advantage of a benefit or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This agreement does not prevent the parties to apply the simplified procedures , even under the use of data processing , with regard to further facili@@ tation for those involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In particular , the simplified procedures can be seen in particular that the goods are not present at a customs office and the registration for these goods cannot be submitted to the customs office ; moreover , the delivery of an incomplete application may be admitted . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , a registration required by the competent authorities to act on a peri@@ odic collective agreement must be submitted within the deadline set by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted instead of using paper documents . &quot;
&quot; if the document is used , the parties involved with the consent of the competent authorities can add to the import and import @-@ related con@@ gres@@ ses instead of the suppl@@ ementary papers to the uni@@ fying paper in the trade of common lists in which the goods are described . &quot;
&quot; - to each other agreements or agreements with regard to a further simpli@@ fication of for@@ getting , for their entire goods transport , or for partial areas ; &quot;
&quot; - for ship@@ ments , which include several types of goods , to assist the con@@ veying of cargo in the dispatch process of charge @-@ lists instead of the suppl@@ ementary sheets to the document paper ; &quot;
&quot; if applicable , regi@@ strations may be created by public or private data processing plants according to the conditions specified by the competent authorities ; &quot;
&quot; - to allow the relevant authorities to enter the data required in their data processing systems to the treatment of regi@@ strations , and if necessary , if necessary , without a written registration ; &quot;
&quot; in the case of the use of a data processing system for the use of a data processing system to treat the regi@@ strations , the export , shipping or import registration must either be created by this system created by this system , or if such a paper is not created by entering the data into the data processing system ; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it is necessary to apply measures that were adopted by the Mixed Committee in the way of a decision by Article 11 of 3 . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) In anne@@ x II , the provisions on the supply of goods carried out in the export , ship@@ ments and the import of goods , are settled in App@@ endix II to this Agreement . &quot;

&quot; ( 1 ) The registration is authorised by the competent authorities of the country , which is authorised by the competent authorities of the country in which the provision of delivery or ship@@ ments shall be provided . &quot;
&quot; if applicable , the customs authority of the country or the country of the country or its representative in this country may demand a translation of the registration to the official language or the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Sub@@ mitted by paragraph 1 , the registration shall always be carried out in one of the official languages of the import country , if it is submitted in this country under the use of other than the copies of the country &apos;s customs office . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative can only use the application documents required for each individual process of goods between the contrac@@ ting parties , and if necessary , the documents required to assist in the subsequent sections may be included in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of the paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are satisfied as far as possible that the information contained in the copies of the application are included in the individual process sections . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure a smooth goods transport between the parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or violations , the customs authorities of these countries submit each other to request or - if they consider it of interest to another contrac@@ ting party - from itself from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may or may be denied or rejected , if the requested country of the view is that the administration would viol@@ ate its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other major interests , or viol@@ ate a business , business or professional confi@@ denti@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In case of refusal or rejection of the minist@@ erial assistance , the appropriate decision and its justification to the seeking country are in@@ viol@@ able . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) For the customs authority of a country for official aid , which could not afford it , if it is seeking it , it points out to this circum@@ stance . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) In accordance with paragraph 1 , only for the purposes of this Convention shall only be used for the purposes of this Convention , and enjoy the protection of the country &apos;s inn@@ um@@ erable right to receive this kind . &quot;
&quot; this information may only be used with written consent of the customs authority , which it has issued , and subject to the restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) There is a mixed committee , in which every party party of this Agreement is represented . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) The committee has a business order , which , among other things , regul@@ ates the conven@@ ing of meetings as well as the appointment of the chairman and the duration of his office . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The Committee may use sub@@ committees and working groups , which support him in his tasks . &quot;
( 1 ) The Committee has the task of managing this Convention and to ensure its proper application .
&quot; in addition , the Committee of the Parties regularly inform@@ s the practical experience with the application of the Convention ; it speaks recommendations , and in cases of paragraph 3 decisions . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) The Committee shall appro@@ ve amend@@ ments of the app@@ endi@@ ces to this Convention , as well as the reductions mentioned in article 4 paragraph 3 of the last line of thought . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representatives of a party in the Mixed Committee assume a decision under the reservation of the constitutional requirements , the decision shall be taken , unless there is no date , on the first day of the second month after notification of the aboli@@ tion of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contrac@@ ting party will meet appropriate measures to ensure effective and balanced implementation of this agreement , whereby the need to be taken into account the difficulties that are loaded to the goods traffic as far as possible and to guarantee satis@@ factory solutions on the basis of the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This agreement applies to the areas in which the contract is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the other hand , as well as for the areas of EF@@ TA countries on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) This agreement also applies to Liechtenstein &apos;s princip@@ ality , as long as the princip@@ ality is associated with the Swiss Con@@ federation by a customs union treaty . &quot;
&quot; each contrac@@ ting party can termin@@ ate this agreement in compliance with a twelve @-@ month deadline ; the written notice is noti@@ fied to the Dep@@ os@@ itary Agreement in Article 17 , which is noti@@ fied to all other parties of the party . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This agreement will take effect on 1 January 1988 , provided by the Parties to the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities by 1 November 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) On the first day of the second month , the Convention shall enter into force on the first day of the second month . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is taken in a document in Danish , German , English , Finnish , French , Greek , Icel@@ an@@ dic , Italian , Dutch , Norwegian , Portuguese , Swedish and Spanish ; it is submitted to the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities ; it is submitted to the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities . &quot;

&quot; ( translation ) INTER@@ NAT@@ ION@@ AL TRAN@@ SF@@ ER via the Harmon@@ ized System for the designation and en@@ coding of the goods ( happening to Brussels on June 14 , 1983 ) &quot;
&quot; the contrac@@ tual parties DI@@ ES@@ ES , which have been working under the rule of the Council for cooperation in the Cust@@ oms Area , &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , summari@@ zing , comparing and evaluating statistical data , especially those of international trade , &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to reduce costs caused by the fact that in international trade transactions , goods must be re @-@ lab@@ elled and re @-@ en@@ coded by the transition from a classification system to another , and to facilitate the standardi@@ zation of the trade documents and the transmission of data . &quot;
&quot; in THE estimate that the development of the technology and the structures of international trade are essential changes in the Brussels Agreement on 15 December 1950 on the customs tariff scheme , which necess@@ it@@ ates the import@@ ation of goods into customs tari@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the level of differenti@@ ation required by governments and the economy for collective and statistical purposes is currently far beyond that which is contained in the anne@@ x to the above @-@ mentioned agreement . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; in THE estimate , that the harmon@@ ized system should be used for freight rates and transport statistics of different types of transport , &quot;
&quot; as far as possible , the harmon@@ ized system is determined as far as possible into the systems used for the identification and en@@ coding of goods , &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the harmon@@ ized system is intended to provide a close relationship between import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , IN THE estimate that a close relationship between the Harmon@@ ized System and the International War@@ ning Directory for Foreign Trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) shall be maintained . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ized system to the development of technology and the structures of international trade , &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the work carried out by the Council for the cooperation on the territory of the Cust@@ oms System , the Committee for Harmon@@ ized System in this area has done &quot;
&quot; although the agreement on customs tariff scheme has proven to be an effective instrument in order to achieve some of these objectives , the conclusion of a new international agreement is the most appropriate way to achieve the desired result . &quot;
&quot; in the sense of this agreement , a ) &quot; harmon@@ ised system for the term and en@@ coding of goods , &quot; referred to in the App@@ endix to this Agreement , consisting of positions and sub @-@ positions with the associated code numbers , from the notes to the sections . chapters and sub@@ positions as well as the general provisions for the interpretation of the Harmon@@ ized System ; &quot;
