&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Department report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , in which the Committee of Human Physi@@ cians ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the trials carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also included in the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you want further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder in which the patient can have various episodes ( periods of abnormal mood ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if oral use of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used or the melting tablets in patients can be used to treat the swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , just like A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole pres@@ um@@ ably acts as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the rec@@ ept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter acts to activate the rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms was examined in three studies of up to one year .
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared with 8@@ 05 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which led to increased un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , in another study compared to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder caused by increased un@@ rest , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ ised the melting tablets and the solution to take into account .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg , or 15 mg , significantly reduced the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administ@@ ered to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also decreased more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled sugar@@ s ) , trem@@ bling , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee on Human Physi@@ cians ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes in which the man@@ ic episodes had addressed the treatment with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks .
&quot; in addition , the committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution during rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. to permit A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients showing mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day in a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day each day regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , ir@@ respective of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in treating schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changes of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( dehy@@ d@@ ration , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ el@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if one with abili@@ fy treated patients signs signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with conv@@ ul@@ sions in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in cases associated with conv@@ ul@@ sions in connection with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , had an increased mort@@ ality risk compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was one of these studies , a study with fixed doses , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ desirable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events associated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma , or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ eth@@ ylene , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ic and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should regularly be monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ el pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased by 107 % , while C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metaboli@@ zers , the common application of highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common application of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of abili@@ fy should be raised to the D@@ os@@ is@@ höhe prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a day no significant effect on the metaboli@@ tes of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ore@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ acryl@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to insufficient data for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in animal re@@ productive studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk of the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ el pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole were a overall lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of eps 19 % was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of eps 14.@@ 8 % was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % was observed in patients under Ari@@ sto@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of eps 26.@@ 6 % was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those of lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the inci@@ dence of eps 18.@@ 2 % for patients was 18.@@ 2 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between patient groups among ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality among elderly demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes Mel@@ lit@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ dosing was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose , since Ari@@ el pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma rotation . &quot;
it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder can be communic@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recep@@ tor and the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor and a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 adren@@ aline and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ Reci@@ pi@@ a . &quot;

&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ sto@@ cy@@ z@@ ole showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;

&quot; current values of measured values defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ el pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate compared with 34 % in the Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % less than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multi @-@ blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed doses of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ el pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in week 3 and a preservation effect that was comparable with that of lithium or semi @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in week 12 , Ari@@ el pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which sometimes did not reflect li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ el pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase , with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in preventing a set@@ back into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzyme C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ d@@ ration and hydro@@ xy@@ las@@ ing of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ lin@@ ation is cat@@ alysts by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in exten@@ sive met@@ aboli@@ sation over C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metaboli@@ zation via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients does not show gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
&quot; using a ne@@ sted log@@ it approach the impact of agglomer@@ ation economies , labour market conditions and distance on the location choice decision is investigated . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 19 / 2015 &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar to patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ o@@ cardi@@ ogen@@ ic potential , pre @-@ clinical data have no particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ dose toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 @-@ 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady State ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ x@@ yl@@ ation was found as a result of the ero@@ sion of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ phen@@ ol in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of 30 mg found in the human G@@ all were no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro @-@ sol@@ u@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical test dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 Late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder can be communic@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .

it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder can be communic@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; 46 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ el pra@@ z@@ ole in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in preventing a set@@ back in the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day in a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day each day regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing abili@@ fy tablets can alternatively take the melting tablets alternatively to stabili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changes of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole

it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder can be communic@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multi @-@ blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed doses of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo . &quot;

&quot; in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical test dose . &quot;
abili@@ fy injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with oral application of Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ c@@ ision of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
&quot; a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0,@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a secondary oral treatment with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to abili@@ fy tablets , abili@@ fy melt tablets or abili@@ fy solution . &quot;
&quot; there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder . &quot;
&quot; in case of par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution as necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( dehy@@ d@@ ration , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ el@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ eth@@ ylene , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ic and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should regularly be monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; however , the intensity of Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the intra@@ mus@@ cular occ@@ lusion of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in the healthy subjects Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) , and simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ tri@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in the case of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metaboli@@ zers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of abili@@ fy should be raised to the D@@ os@@ is@@ höhe prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which approximately three @-@ quarter earlier had received anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in general treatment and mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel containing ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot;
&quot; only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metast@@ atic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs for efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metast@@ atic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients , bre@@ ast@@ feeding or at the beginning of the treatment low neutral phil@@ ately numbers in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the committee for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was involved in patients in which the first treatment was no more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , and that unlike other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel containing medicines , it was not necessary to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited to permit Abra@@ x@@ ane &apos;s involvement in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients , in which the first @-@ line treatment for metast@@ atic disease is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ cs &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sensory neuro@@ path@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose in subsequent series should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in sensory neuro@@ path@@ y grade 3 , the treatment is to break until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with slight to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been conducted with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data to worry and effectiveness .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles form@@ ulation of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , which could significantly different pharmac@@ ological features as other form@@ ulations of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment will be initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutr@@ ality count rises to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count rises to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly defined cardi@@ om@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not detected in connection with the cardi@@ om@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardiac or pul@@ mon@@ ary disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of the patient after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not practice in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not prac@@ tise effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply for a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to witness no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised before treatment via a sperm con@@ val@@ escence because of the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the ability of the machines .
&quot; the following are the most common and most important cases of side effects reported in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most prominent important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was fast reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed with 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in table 1 , the side effects reported in conjunction with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 78@@ 9 ) . &quot;

pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the formation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ ses the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ arization .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in is transported by the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
&quot; it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sports @-@ dot@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ ous recep@@ tor and , due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , a pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel @-@ accumulation in the tumor area occurs . &quot;
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic breast cancer is supported by the data of 106 patients in two single @-@ handed non@@ verbal studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III study .
&quot; in a study 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multic@@ enter study was conducted in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , either in the form of a solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in form of abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medit@@ ation ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ asis points . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ ases and 19 % for metast@@ atic and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First Line Therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by improving a grade for patients who experienced a peripheral neuro@@ path@@ y grade 3 during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neuro@@ path@@ y to sound on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the drug ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel @-@ plasma concentration took on a multi@@ phase mode . &quot;
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume shows a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel were compared with an intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher ( 43 % ) after Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gabe ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel inj@@ ections , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is primarily metaboli@@ zed with 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and to two smaller Met@@ aboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 , in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the Met@@ aboli@@ tes 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing . &quot;
&quot; however , patients at the age of 75 have only few data available , as only 3 patients of this age group participate in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ light protected over 8 hours .

&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which a blood trans@@ fusion can occur if a blood don@@ or is not possible before the intervention , and in which a loss of blood from 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and for patients who want to make an own blood don@@ or , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be done by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided they have received adequate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ es should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter for adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl for children ) . &quot;
&quot; iron levels of all patients must be controlled before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administ@@ ered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ ine deficiency , or that the body does not respond adequ@@ ately to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is produced , which em@@ powers them to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with an injection in a v@@ ein as part of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , with the reference drug . &quot;
&quot; in all patients participating in this study , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
primary Indi@@ c@@ ator for Eff@@ ectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the trial and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company also presented the results of a study investigating the effects of inj@@ ected Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ ra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Physi@@ cians ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , it was demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company committed to Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Pharma P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to permit the launch of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , in case of planned major operating interventions , requiring a large blood volume set ( 4 or more units blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
&quot; HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected loss of blood of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot be part of an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ emia and consequ@@ ential symptoms can be different depending on age , gender and overall disease . therefore , the assessment of individual clinical course and disease resistance is required by the doctor . &quot;
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in around more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ es can occasionally be observed in a patient or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose prescribed for controlling an@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the clinical findings suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical findings suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intra@@ ven@@ ous application if necessary with an increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; an@@ emia and other symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease . therefore , the assessment of individual clinical course and disease resistance is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose prescribed for control of an@@ emia .
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value at ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count to ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be ab@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; patients with slight an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ m 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre@@ vent@@ able deposit of ≥ 4 blood @-@ preserved foods is required , should be obtained at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the operation . &quot;
iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( Day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgical procedure and the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each subsequent days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic cooking salt solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
patients who suffer from the treatment with some er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin on er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sts ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia and PR@@ CA ) should not be ab@@ used or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ ect@@ omy ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ or@@ is , increased risk of deep v@@ ein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ embo@@ li@@ sm ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lusion , vas@@ cular disease of the car@@ oti@@ ves or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting ( PR@@ CA ) Very seldom has been reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .

&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te &quot; Index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0,5 % ) , and if no other reason is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone @-@ spinal cord for a diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ duc@@ ts in patients with a risk of an@@ tic@@ ular @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ese @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that is attri@@ but@@ able to the application of epo@@ et@@ ines when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in intake should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ ative cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in tum@@ our patients receiving chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be considered ( patients who need to be trans@@ figured ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is larger than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tion with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for applying re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement in the specific clinical context .
&quot; if possible , before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo major electrical surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mbo@@ sis proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an increased risk for post@@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cular events can be excluded in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial equivalent of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tum@@ our patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia , or to reduce the risk of tum@@ our progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy once a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; if Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ do@@ sis can be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies on tum@@ our tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological differenti@@ ation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; about thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ emic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased inci@@ dence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; ir@@ respective of er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetic analysis of al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ lic and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate percentage identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emic patients . &quot;
&quot; with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese . &quot;

survival and tum@@ our progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and the control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than in controls . &quot;
the overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and in controls satis@@ factory .
&quot; there is an increased risk for thro@@ mbo@@ embo@@ lic events in tum@@ our patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival can not be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are applied to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tum@@ our patients , which are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transfer@@ ring a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as few patients with these characteristics were included in the veri@@ fied data . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ants after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers , and an extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the level of levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels , which are achieved after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they will be determined 24 hours after the first dose or 24 hours after the final gift . &quot;
&quot; bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of the chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans , and could be caused by secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors . &quot;
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated for three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the inci@@ dence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experiments with approximately the 20@@ x of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa introduced al@@ fa to dimin@@ ished f@@ itt@@ al body weight , to delay the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in f@@ ö@@ t@@ inal mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tum@@ our tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a period of 3 days outside the cooling cabinet and not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glu@@ ed label , so that if necessary , the measurement of quantities is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( Day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgical procedure and the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 . &quot;

&quot; prior to the market launch and by agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the owner of the approval has to supply the medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the auth@@ orization for the traffic has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. is set up and functional before the drug is brought into circulation , and as long as it is applied in the transport of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan specified in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) is agreed upon , as well as in accordance with any subsequent updating of the Risk Management Plan . &quot;
&quot; according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for Applied products for human use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , PS@@ UR ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • on receipt of new information , the influence on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the measures to reduce risk reduction • within 60 days after reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction in particular ) mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; • During a month prior to your treatment , if you suffer from a heart attack or stroke , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina P@@ ect@@ or@@ is ( for the first time or stronger chest pain ) , the risk of a blood dri@@ p formation in the v@@ eins ( deep v@@ ein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) has occurred - for example , such a blood dri@@ p has occurred . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lusion ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ( cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ) or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it may occur within the normal range to a light dose @-@ dependent increase in blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which rec@@ edes again in further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will need to carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before the start of therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection ( under the skin , er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was reported ) . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting , it will break your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given through injection into a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ous ) , if you are treated for an an@@ emia due to a kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value can be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or increasing pot@@ assi@@ um levels , your doctor may consider stopping the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assi@@ um values lie in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or di@@ gestion by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of blood @-@ wor@@ m@@ wood with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( kidney failure ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
&quot; 200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) , and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood dri@@ pping ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible . &quot;
&quot; this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep v@@ ein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary embo@@ li@@ sm ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and may adver@@ sely affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if a larger orth@@ op@@ edic surgery is im@@ minent , the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of dro@@ ple@@ t formation after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other drugs or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or in HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood @-@ wor@@ m@@ wood ( an@@ emia ) refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is not exceeded . &quot;
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia is addressing the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to sh@@ orten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the surgery and further 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your physician considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to splash Ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
&quot; eye li@@ der and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke @-@ ede@@ ma ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as t@@ ing@@ ling , red@@ ness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when applying Ab@@ se@@ amed &quot; ) .
&quot; after repeated blood donations , it can occur - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood dri@@ p formation ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events ) . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of bleeding after surgery ( post@@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you will significantly affect or if you notice side effects , which are not stated in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or disc@@ arded . &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ itt@@ le ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a sli@@ ghtest trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as during the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus pass , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of vert@@ eb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures was studied over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
primary Indi@@ c@@ ator for the Eff@@ ic@@ acy was whether the content of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of vert@@ eb@@ rates in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) has been reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most adverse events of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides clari@@ fying material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the drug &apos;s side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to permit Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s involvement in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package insert • contra@@ indication of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When looking back to medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently er@@ ased low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended for two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get . &quot;
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta was observed a long re@@ mission period in patients receiving treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure adequate intake of calcium for at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the inci@@ dence of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen to the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
patients with kidney dys@@ function ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for the use of children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data are lacking for the harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ ine is to be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure adequate intake of calcium for at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; for patients who need dental hand@@ gri@@ ps , no data are available , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be based on the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta were increased ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in Oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was comparable to the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;

&quot; kidney dys@@ function C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with kidney dys@@ function , which is associated with kidney function ( i.e. increasing the ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure . &quot;
the changes in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured before the date ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years comparable to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after application was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels that were below the normal sw@@ elling area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently er@@ ased hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administ@@ ering Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported by local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;

the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ mus@@ cular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion . &quot;

the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % with Ac@@ la@@ sta treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ EC@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was compared to the weekly gift of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate to the pro @-@ cent@@ red change of lum@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined to patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly light to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um levels of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ - to 3,@@ 0@@ times age @-@ specific upper normal in the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ac@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months has been proven in two six month comparative studies .
&quot; after 6 months , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who had been classified as a respon@@ dent at the end of the six month study were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 of the patients treated with acet@@ az@@ sta , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , will be maintained during a mid @-@ term follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes contin@@ ual in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients received the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level quickly rose to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;

&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administ@@ ered dose in the urine , while the remain@@ der is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total Body Clear@@ ance is 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h ir@@ respective of the dose of 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ class class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus pass of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormon@@ es , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other drugs or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicine , known to them that they damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drinks , you may need enough liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administ@@ ered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have broken down the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administ@@ ered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than one year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you missed Ac@@ la@@ sta administration , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before ending the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you consider the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions , however , less frequently . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

patients with a recently er@@ ased low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture is recommended to take the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic continuous , hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended . &quot;

&quot; the difference between the 20 mg and plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) . &quot;
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % by direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z

&quot; Summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Department report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , in which it is explained how the Committee on Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the trials carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ etic medication ) can be applied .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , it can not be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the present dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ y ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo until the age of 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tos led to lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ xing study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl resin in a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional plac@@ ebo effect was reduced by 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos also referred to insulin , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ( high ket@@ one level - acid - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ is is not displayed . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on one side mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for use of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 18 years , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endanger@@ ed by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma , when Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre@@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , there was an increase in the reports on heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror increases to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hep@@ atic dys@@ function such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , over@@ weight , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ s , the liver enzyme values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on should be conducted by clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be stir@@ red by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction in the mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ es ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on as oral twin or triple combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , was reported on an occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report disorders of vision . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of un@@ desirable events relating to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a study of over 3.5 years on the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is sus@@ cep@@ tible to treatment ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the study of the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ ox@@ ins , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reductions are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on around 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the parent &apos;s animal is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic rate for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from the present data not app@@ rais@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the lens and the link of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , AL@@ T climb@@ s occurred over the thre@@ ef@@ old of the upper limit of the standard range , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on res@@ p . &quot;
&quot; since its launch , it has rarely been reported about heart failure under pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; PSYNDEX is the most comprehensive abstract database ( not full @-@ text ) of psychological literature , audiovisual media , intervention programs , and tests from the German @-@ speaking countries . the search interface PubPsych offers an easy to use search interface in English , &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3,5 years , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 m@@ g. / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on appears to act on activation of specific nuclear rec@@ ept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite a three @-@ month optim@@ isation phase with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continue to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over one year , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ as compared to the initial evalu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d reduced the total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was observed under pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease were random@@ ized , which were either either either Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is rapidly absorbed , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothetical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015 &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ ox@@ ins , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ actively marked Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the marker was found mainly in the f@@ issu@@ s ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination trial of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metaboli@@ tes is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with limited kidney function than in healthy subjects , but similar to the or@@ ally clearing of the mother &apos;s substance . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys matched with ha@@ em@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ trophy in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the parent &apos;s animal is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic rate for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased inci@@ dences of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epithel@@ ium were induced .
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to increased frequency of colli@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a study of over 3.5 years on the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were examined . &quot;
in clinical trials over one year under pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ as was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial evalu@@ ations .
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on did not only improve the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which both have an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ tz@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was lacking in terms of its primary end@@ point , a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on . &quot;

&quot; in clinical trials in which pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on was compared with other oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics or plac@@ ebo ( effective tablets ) , women ( but not in men ) who took Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on showed a higher number of frac@@ tures . &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is usually applied once or twice a day when a rapid initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
&quot; for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is 978 human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) , it is produced using the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that blood sugar levels were similar to other human insulin levels . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ ylene may be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is the package insert ) . &quot;
the committee for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in treating diabetes are out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to permit Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane to operate within the European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day when a rapid initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be treated under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood glucose level has significantly improved through intensive insulin therapy , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia alert symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; every change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phas@@ oil , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin an@@ alogue ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient a dose @-@ adjustment is necessary , it may be necessary during the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after switching . &quot;
some patients who occurred hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin .
&quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to insulin and meals to be used at other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions in therapy and always ask his patients for other drugs taken by them . &quot;
&quot; 4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ sufficient controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ etic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in u@@ ter@@ o . &quot;
heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can lead to in@@ som@@ nia and / or conv@@ ul@@ sions and end with temporary or permanent distur@@ ban@@ ces of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Periph@@ eral neuro@@ path@@ y A rapid recovery of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neuro@@ path@@ y and are usually reversible .
&quot; 5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of the blood glucose level , however , can be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy . &quot;
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may arise when failed to change the sub@@ stit@@ ches within the injection area .
&quot; during insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) . &quot;
&quot; diseases of the immune system Occ@@ a@@ sion@@ ally - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ it them Very rare - an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alised hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alised r@@ ash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , g@@ astro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ onic ede@@ ma , breathing problems , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and imp@@ air@@ ment / consciousness . &quot;
&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours , and the total active length is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption Profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of sp@@ litt@@ ing ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were moved into consideration ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data can not identify any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane bottle is extracted from the refrigerator - the temperature of insulin at room temperature ( not over 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ p@@ ected according to the instructions for the first use .
some patients who occurred hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin .

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already show signs of cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or po@@ ds ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger urine crystal deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per deci@@ liter , the dose can be increased to 120 m@@ g. once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ ato@@ id arthritis may occur , therefore it is recommended that patients should take more medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the drug is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with plac@@ ebo ( plac@@ ebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol ( another drug for treating hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with allo@@ pur@@ inol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ inol was applied in a dose of 300 m@@ g. a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 m@@ g. a day . &quot;
primary Indi@@ c@@ ator for Eff@@ ic@@ acy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were below 6 mg / dl for the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients , who once had a daily 120@@ mg daily , had a ur@@ ic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol and in no one of 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver damage . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Physi@@ cians ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ inol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia in diseases which have already led to ur@@ at@@ ab@@ norm@@ alities ( including one from the medical history known or currently present ) and / or rheum@@ ato@@ id arthritis .
&quot; if the ser@@ um acid level after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increase at A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restri@@ ction , efficacy and safety were not fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and teenagers Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ vre is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; organ transplan@@ t recipients Since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ine is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ emic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure is not recommended for treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ary disease ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ c acid @-@ related medicines , it may occur during the treatment of acute exposure because by lowering the ser@@ um acid level , ur@@ ic acid deposits can be mobili@@ sed in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; for example , with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine is so widespread in rare cases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease During the Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed at Feb@@ u@@ at@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3,5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to carry out a liver function before the beginning of Feb@@ u@@ ary treatment and further course ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ war did not have any interaction studies on Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported to other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous administration of Feb@@ vre and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in Feb@@ vre ex@@ position ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of un@@ desirable events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adaptation for Feb@@ vre or the other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study with test persons 120 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily , a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which points to a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ u@@ cin@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an an@@ ta@@ zi@@ d@@ um , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminium hydro@@ x@@ ide , is delayed and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x is 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C results . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies let not exclu@@ de side effects from Feb@@ u@@ ania to pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher inci@@ dence of cardiovascular events reported in the total f@@ eb@@ cle@@ tian group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with Feb@@ vre was detected . &quot;
the risk factors determined by these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects , which were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ine treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diarr@@ ho@@ ea and nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical trials no serious skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions are observed .
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term renewal studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 906 patients have been treated for up to one year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ u@@ ary 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ary treatment groups more than once , and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ u@@ ary 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :

primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restri@@ ction The AP@@ EX trial evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney dys@@ function ( D. h ) .
&quot; A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients . &quot;

primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um res@@ ins ≥ 10 mg / dl et@@ wa 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um res@@ um concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ al acid levels increased to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients required a treatment against a po@@ uring rate ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a po@@ uring ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the node size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs by month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ l / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ cin@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received allo@@ pur@@ inol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ vre was simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ propor@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; for doses , between 120 mg and 300 m@@ g. a rise in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking a simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um res@@ ins was observed ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ vre is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 m@@ g. .
&quot; the plasma red binding of Feb@@ u@@ cc@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent with the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative Met@@ aboli@@ tes mainly were formed by C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 , or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ u@@ stra@@ tion@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is primarily created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ eted Feb@@ u@@ cin@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as unchanged Feb@@ u@@ cin@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative Met@@ aboli@@ tes and their Kon@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine , about 45 % of the dosage was found in the chair as an unchanged Feb@@ u@@ cin@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative Met@@ aboli@@ tes and their Kon@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x from Feb@@ u@@ cin@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C from Feb@@ vre took about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney dys@@ function .
12 Li@@ ver dys@@ function after taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with lighter ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver dys@@ function altered the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ cin@@ ost@@ at and its metaboli@@ tes not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ cin@@ ost@@ at or its metaboli@@ tes after taking multiple oral doses of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and is considered not relevant for clinical application .
it was found that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproduction performance of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which were at 4,@@ 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occ@@ ured that accompanied with a reduction in breeding performance and development delays in rats . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a condition where the bones are br@@ itt@@ le ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause in which there is a risk for a low vitamin D level .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other drugs ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie until after the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 can already be used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company laid data that stem from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE to increase the vitamin D level .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE was lower ( 11 % ) than those associated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also submitted data , which stated that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is exactly the dose prescribed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ ature ( muscles , bones , joints ) and symptoms of di@@ gestive disorders such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer@@ a ( swal@@ lowing ) , ul@@ cer@@ a ( blo@@ ated stomach ) and aci@@ dic absorption . &quot;
&quot; in patients with excess hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in case of case of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . approval for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking medication ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplement ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are exactly to follow in order to reduce the risk of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet without chew@@ ing the tablet in the mouth , because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take the tablet from the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ la@@ sty , only under special care ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; ob@@ ses@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions like ec@@ s@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ p@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partly these severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate potential mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions like dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ spective pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate a mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to patients and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , rare ( after market introduction ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose reg@@ im@@ en was predominantly intra@@ ven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to give evidence , whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure , reduce the risk of a jaw bone of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment planning for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
&quot; they should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of a tablet per week , as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequ@@ ately before the start of treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicine can affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate give no indication of directly damaging effects on pregnancy which can detect embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients but has also been reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
&quot; nevertheless , the ser@@ um calcium deposits up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 1,3 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in@@ order an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the means of 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Distribution studies in rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intra@@ ven@@ ous application of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous treatment of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ og@@ s . &quot;

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administ@@ ered adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer can already be used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
primary Indi@@ c@@ ator of the Eff@@ ic@@ acy was the number of patients who had died after a treatment of a year ( by investigating how often a new organ transplan@@ t or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer . &quot;

&quot; in patients with more hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro @-@ lid antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious if others ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the advance dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ nish yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atin capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; 0,25 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the form@@ ulation or the ré@@ g@@ ime should only be performed under close @-@ line control of one in the transplan@@ t experienced by experienced medical practitioners ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a change to an alternative formula , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below ) .
&quot; after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley levels should be controlled before change@@ over and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a mirror , was comparable to both both at ni@@ er@@ - and le@@ ber@@ transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ents are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the direct follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f D@@ os@@ is@@ schem@@ as may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State reaches . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition does not permit oral use of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for producing an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy may not be specified . &quot;

&quot; further dose adjustments may be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The or@@ ale Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; D@@ os@@ is@@ recommended - change@@ over from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted to a daily intake of Progra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of asp@@ agra@@ f , so this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , referred to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection is necessary .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f is an oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day every day .
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with insec@@ tici@@ des , pan@@ cre@@ atic and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients , occ@@ ured in an oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in a oral initial dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in special patient groups Pati@@ ents with reduced liver function To maintain blood cells in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus it may be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary .
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um dop@@ amine levels , calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ r@@ lear@@ ance and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f At the conversion of a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ mirror controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled by change@@ over from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , alter@@ ations of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or while using substances which could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the seb@@ um levels in the blood flow 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in aut@@ op@@ sy - and heart @-@ transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection and other side effects , which may occur in consequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the form@@ ulation or the ré@@ g@@ ime should only be performed under close @-@ line control of one in the transplan@@ t experienced by experienced medical practitioners ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data are available for the re@@ tar@@ ded form@@ ulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effectiveness of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) may contain , or other plant health remedi@@ es during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentration in the blood is advised , since the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , it was known as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , known as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , which may therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ function , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ si@@ va , exposure of sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun@@ screen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S like head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mp@@ s and vision disorders , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption , special caution is required for patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedi@@ es known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended that the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may change , monitor and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage to maintain steady concentrations accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the increase in blood levels is mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal nar@@ rowing . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicine Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with drugs , which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , may affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , precau@@ tions are particularly cau@@ tious when decisions about sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to contrac@@ eption . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
results from a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not provide evidence that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and the outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born on possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kid@@ neys ) is recommended . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; Week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( inci@@ dence 8 of 111 new@@ born babies , i.e. : &quot;
the side @-@ effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ si@@ va is often not accurate due to the under@@ going disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other drugs .
&quot; in the following , the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) . &quot;

it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated ly@@ mph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ u@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot@@ eins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the compound in the nucle@@ us . &quot;
&quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thus preventing transcription at a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of B cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recep@@ tor . &quot;

&quot; factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rite and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a rein@@ forcement of metabolism , is to be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ots ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of application apply to whether Adv@@ ance is used for the treatment of bleeding or preventing bleeding in surgical interventions .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing bleeding problems like bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought into , capable of producing the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is a different medicine approved in the European Union , called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but it is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was used to prevent bleeding and surgical interventions . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in preventing bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tic periods with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ xy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG to permit a permit to transport lawyers across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of substitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , according to the location and extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period does not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections will be recommended to determine the factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differenti@@ ate in their reaction to factor VIII , reaching different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value times . &quot;
&quot; 3 Proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , cans should be given between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days . &quot;
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities cannot be achieved , or if the bleeding is not ruled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ory levels , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the rate of submission should be directed after finding the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da ass@@ ay .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ position sta@@ ins and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically well @-@ known inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and bre@@ ast@@ feeding has no experience . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ R@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which show a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els was post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ENT in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in Plasma and Clear@@ ance @-@ Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post @-@ operative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE with 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ ory type ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , no one of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was determined by a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial were 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients against factor VIII .
&quot; the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a sustained peak of the anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the inci@@ dence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intra@@ ven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ENT was reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
&quot; the activated factor VIII acts as a factor for the activated factor IX , acceler@@ ating the formation of activated factor X from factor X . &quot;
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed below table 3 .

December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company with@@ drew its application for approval from Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , bones , or the soft tissues ( tissues , which links other structures in the body , are affected and supported ) . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been altered so that there are no copies of itself and thus no infections in humans can trigger . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus enable the cancer cells to re@@ construct the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , formed from which is not def@@ ective in the human body , contributes to restore damaged DNA and to kill cells if the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work correctly , and the cancer cells can grow further and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub@@ strate , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP reviewed the answers to the questions presented to him , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP documents a list of questions sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors is beneficial for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way , and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not know whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changes drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other is slowly released over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( ha@@ y fever , caused by allergi@@ es to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adolescents from age 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reli@@ eved on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy was the changes in the sever@@ ity of ha@@ y fever symptoms that were reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in view of all ha@@ y fever symptoms other than the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who took aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6,@@ 0 % compared with 35.@@ 9 % in patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( other drugs for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary or vas@@ cular disease including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ sis ) , or a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a cer@@ eb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ) or a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without cutting them , to break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data on accidents and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days , because of long @-@ term use the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin can decrease with time . &quot;
&quot; after the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within the two weeks after completion of such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctions such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ ger@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ ov@@ arian Rhin@@ ologi@@ an . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that the treatment in appearance of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder reconstruction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions , respectively . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests there were no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , ir@@ respective of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate was alone or taken with alcohol . &quot;
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine enzyme has not yet been identified so that interaction with other drugs can not be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; the dis@@ comfort of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however do not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; because reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness in very rare cases , which may result in imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic integrity or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with potential lethal canc@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; head@@ aches , anxiety , complicated mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ ous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thir@@ st , tran@@ spi@@ ration , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disorders and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ ine on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement sizes of the flight level , including rein@@ forcement of subjective b@@ lows , or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can cause other sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , whereby 414 patients received Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the lax@@ ative effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethni@@ city . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ ally application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers more than 14 days , the flow equ@@ ilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was reached on day 10 . &quot;

a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin after the sole application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin bio@@ a@@ qui@@ valent was to ex@@ position after the application of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , however , pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot be recognized for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin . &quot;
in re@@ productive sto@@ x@@ ic studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and ra@@ bb@@ its in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system is established , and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to alle@@ vi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine very rarely reported about cases of serious allergic reactions ( breathing , whi@@ st@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , it@@ ching and sw@@ elling ) or skin r@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; about cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , abdominal pain , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach complaints , diarr@@ he@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of eye @-@ catching liver test@@ oster@@ one has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ate to take ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged between 1 and 5 years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children ages 6 to 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was examined in total eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with an allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and two studies of patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by investigating the changes in the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after a six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body evalu@@ ates the sy@@ rup , the solution , and the melting tablets in the same way as tablets and application in children is harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , the results of all trials were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ ER@@ I@@ US to an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ER@@ I@@ US may not be applied to patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate , Lor@@ at@@ adin or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the launch of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( inci@@ dence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the present disease progression and can be res@@ umed after the symptoms of the symptoms and res@@ umed with their recovery .
the persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergic reaction time .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US and alcohol did not ampli@@ fy the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness in very rare cases , which may result in imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic integrity or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse side effects , reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients aged 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect was head@@ ache , which was treated by 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate and with 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administ@@ ered up to 45 m@@ g. of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nine times clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ ine on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate was administ@@ ered at a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring sizes of the flight , including rein@@ forcement of subjective b@@ lows , or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as based on the overall scores of the question@@ naire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US effectively dimin@@ ishes the stress caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a representative for further forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ancient diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can also lead to other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving pren@@ itus and lowering of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
improved it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed with 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine deficiency has not yet been identified so that interaction with other medicines is not completely ruled out . &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not effect on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; the company generated sales of 49 billion euros in 2014 . * Its operations are divided into four business sectors : mobility Solutions , Industrial Technology , Consumer Goods , and Energy and Building Technology . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; coloured film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ mine ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , Car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax . &quot;
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US can be taken independently of meals to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ ber doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of an inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es . &quot;
&quot; about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metaboli@@ zing des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate , and experienced higher sub@@ st@@ ressing levels ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup for children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to those in children who are normally metabolic . &quot;
&quot; this medicine does not include su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients should not use her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ som@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug . &quot;
clinical studies with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were not detected in clinical studies involving er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets and alcohol did not ampli@@ fy the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup group similar to plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , there were 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , administ@@ ered up to 45 m@@ g. of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nine times clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , who were asked for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dose dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the child population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied more than ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US pills performed in clinical studies to no imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ otor skills . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol is neither a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced imp@@ air@@ ment nor increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as based on the overall scores of the question@@ naire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US pills are effectively reducing the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving pren@@ itus and lowering of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restri@@ ctive phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup form@@ ulation of children aged between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
&quot; there are no indications of a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient accumulation , once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents . &quot;
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate were comparable with the recommended doses , with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine deficiency has not yet been identified so that interaction with other drugs can not be completely ruled out . &quot;

clinical studies with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were not identified in clinical studies involving er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were reported , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate ( nine times clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company re@@ jects his application for the prevention of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against influ@@ enza , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus . &quot;
this is a special type of vacc@@ ine that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily be spread from humans , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) . &quot;
HZ@@ I researchers discover control centres in Y@@ ers@@ inia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature
&quot; in this way , the immune system will later be able to make contact with a flu virus of this Stam@@ ina faster antibodies . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body det@@ ects as a foreign det@@ ects ) , has been puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vacc@@ ine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical examination and need more information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you want further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immune deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to inhal@@ e , but this can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor checked , which anti@@ viral medicines of the patient had previously taken , and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , together with 100 m@@ g. of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV quantity in blood and maintains it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS is not to cure , however , the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two major studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ boo@@ sted medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had earlier prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
primary Indi@@ c@@ ator for Eff@@ ic@@ acy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( virus load ) or the change of the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had more than 400 copies / ml less than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to rein@@ force the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or drugs , which are just as well as am@@ cin@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV , people who take A@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( alter@@ ations in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ phy ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( symptoms of infection that are caused by the restor@@ ative immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Physi@@ cians ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to permit A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be administ@@ ered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be taken into account with the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the intake is 14 % less than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on one milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the increased addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on accidents and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dys@@ function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems to 300 m@@ g. twice a day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dys@@ function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width , and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ o@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules can be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal progress .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with pre @-@ existing limited liver function , including chronic hep@@ atitis , show increased inci@@ dence of liver dys@@ function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , it can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ i@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ gen content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this form@@ ulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the occurrence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exposure to an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us was reported . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases which were necessary for their therapy to be associated with the development of a diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders associated . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ äm@@ ophil@@ a patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ atom@@ as and ha@@ em@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including using cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ o@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with drugs whose active substances are mainly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with the increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very common adverse effects were observed in the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ uth and , if possible , to check the viral load and to susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
a dose @-@ adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ z below ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x decreased by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , proving the efficacy and dis@@ comfort of this treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
52 % lower when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administ@@ ered twice daily .
&quot; in combination with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 600 mg twice daily ) , the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are administ@@ ered twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and KA@@ LE@@ TRA can not be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and dis@@ comfort of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was performed in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the imagin@@ able component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , the revenues from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adap@@ tion is required . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ rus in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pins on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pins possibly reduce the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this medicine should be used at the same time , precau@@ tions are advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as accurate forec@@ asting of the effects of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin around 193 % and thus to increase the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase will be advised to reduce the dose of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with at@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but could be increased plasma levels of both drugs in the event of simultaneous administration .
&quot; the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 m@@ g. of F@@ ossi@@ bili@@ s@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ up ) , which was observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ra@@ viol@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; other drugs that are listed below include sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can result in res@@ or@@ ption problems . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can increase significantly and increase plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ides is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly influenced by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected to be expected at the same time . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this drug with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended for more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentration to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with the or@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am or@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while at the same time use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 @-@ Fa@@ che .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administ@@ ered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ i@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; due to the lower reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rus dosage when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in case of simultaneous application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the an@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not fores@@ ee@@ able , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful consideration of the possible usage for the mother compared to the possible risks for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study on pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered by the u@@ ter@@ us in the u@@ ter@@ us until the end of the bre@@ ast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the further development of offspring including fertility and re@@ productive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the parent &apos;s animal .
in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly to moder@@ ately pronounced , occ@@ uring early and often lead to treatment dis@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether or not they are associated with the intake of as@@ thma or other medicines at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the adverse events mentioned below come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and were performed by more than 1 % of patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ ec@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ trophy of breasts and dor@@ o@@ zer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 245 NR@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different NR@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually moderate to moder@@ ately pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or dark pap@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ ane@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without leaving the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients , 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase were treated twice daily with low @-@ dose rite cor@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , which were similar to those associated with low @-@ dose chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dosing , the patient is able to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute @-@ infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of the HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages have been observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ stain@@ ed treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely . &quot;

&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns , which were similar to those in adults . &quot;

&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is defined as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ ossi@@ ping avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral , not pre @-@ treated patients , in which a f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sin@@ equ@@ ino@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 4 of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; obtaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which can affect the subsequent treatment . &quot;
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , with PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ under@@ le@@ weight threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached ag@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged between 2 to 18 years of which 152 were previously treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was administ@@ ered twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Basi@@ cally based on this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) until the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x decreased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of the amount and the rate of absorption was influenced . &quot;
the apparent division volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume and an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rus remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents fluctu@@ ates depending on the total amount of drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or in@@ hi@@ bit or in@@ hi@@ b@@ ate or sub@@ strate the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when they are given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ availability than the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dys@@ function should be minimal on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those responsible for a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in dos@@ ages which were repeated twice ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rats ) of exposure to humans , according to twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .

&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in patients , neither during administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and with the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus surgery and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the increased addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe liver dys@@ function , it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dys@@ function ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;

A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 27 when a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ related factors , such as a longer anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders associated . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x decreased by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 600 mg twice daily ) , the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are administ@@ ered twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and KA@@ LE@@ TRA can not be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and dis@@ comfort of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ rus in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as accurate forec@@ asting of the effects of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase will be recommended to reduce the dose of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of simultaneous application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the an@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ ti@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful consideration of the possible usage for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; obtaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , with PI pre @-@ treated children , the benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; gener@@ ase should be considered . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rus remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents fluctu@@ ates during the dosing intervals , depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or in@@ hi@@ bit or in@@ hi@@ b@@ ate or sub@@ strate the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when they are given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;

the underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and with the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r treated animals .

&quot; the benefit of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion was not included in patients treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the intake is 14 % less than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on one milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to take the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , as no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adaptation for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ gen content , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution to in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ate inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of this drug and possibly provo@@ ke serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z . ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 a transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with medication 49 dependent factors , such as a longer anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;

&quot; simultaneous dosing with as@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the data on 54 other C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , a significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to take into account may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk . &quot;

&quot; this can include fat loss of legs , arms , and in the face , a fat loss on the stomach and in other inner organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fatty tissue in the neck ( &quot; &quot; Sti@@ cks &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the other ingredients are Prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( Poly@@ eth@@ ylene gly@@ col 400 ) , Ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am @-@ Kali@@ um , Sac@@ char@@ in sodium , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial chew@@ ing gum , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; • For small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream can be applied three times a week . • For small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream can be applied three times a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies in 9@@ 23 patients with warts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks , and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo were either daily or five times a week . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies , with a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic chor@@ o@@ idal ne@@ ovas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( ob@@ serving more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p for immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or the number of les@@ ions limit efficacy and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday ( Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before going to bed and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine is so long , until all visible pig@@ lets have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
a break in the treatment procedure described above should be vo@@ iced when intensive local inflammation reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if at the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she finds it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and put in the cleaned , inc@@ ru@@ sted skin area until the cream is completely dra@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a consideration of the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a consideration between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection , or gra@@ ft versus host reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily intro@@ sp@@ ection was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a circum@@ c@@ ision of leading cor@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed in rare cases requiring treatment and / or caused temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous app@@ liqu@@ és in the genital area and peri@@ an@@ al@@ gia , no clinical experience has been available . &quot;
&quot; limited data points to an increased rate of inc@@ lin@@ ation reduction in people with HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair approach was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or responses form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s dis@@ comfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be judged after the treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
&quot; since there is no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be taken into consideration in super@@ fi@@ zi@@ tic bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s , no clinical experience is required , therefore the application is not recommended for previously untreated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower likelihood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears , or on the lip area within the lip @-@ pocket . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ m and hands support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions normally take in intensity over the course of the therapy or go after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause major dis@@ comfort or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ ER @-@ les@@ ions showed less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies , there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ ö@@ ter@@ tal development , the band@@ aging or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after mal@@ functioning nor after multi@@ mal@@ ign@@ ant use of ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation may be given to the application during bre@@ ast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most common and probably or possibly associated with the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream application in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions at the location of the treatment of ti@@ lt warts ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treated patients ) .
&quot; among the most commonly reported and likely , or possibly with the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream application , complaints at the application location include a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % . &quot;
the results of 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated bas@@ ali@@ oma patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly using the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine in these studies were a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treated patients ) . &quot;
the side effects reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; according to the test plan , the assessment of clinical signs shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream often came to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , excav@@ ation / ab@@ out@@ ings ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , the assessment of the clinical signs shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very common to severe ore subjects ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and short@@ ening ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dental , unique oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od , which is equivalent to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after or@@ ally or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , increasing systemic concentrations of the alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , the efficacy in reference to a complete ex@@ hal@@ ation of the wr@@ inkl@@ es was significantly superior to a plac@@ ebo treatment for more than 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; at 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , the event was completely eliminated ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients with plac@@ ebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
a full recovery could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine at 5 per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study showed that 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) were clin@@ ically cu@@ red and this also remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ te , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phic AC@@ - les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical ab@@ etting after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications external f@@ issu@@ res , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ tic bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not occur in combination with pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged between 2 and 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) . &quot;
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream caused by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in three weeks of weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ value time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time period after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ affected skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable with the case of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super @-@ target bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG were significantly lowered body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a study conducted for the painting application showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during the mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al administration three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ours on the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ able , there is a risk for humans because of the systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice treated with the effective cream , formerly and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people even if these same symptoms have as you . − If any of the listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired you or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; ● Upper @-@ surface bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma This is a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if left untreated , it may lead to dec@@ lines , especially in the face - hence , early detection and - treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in humans , who were exposed to exposure to sunlight during their life . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the best suitable treatment .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream supports your body &apos;s own immune system in the production of natural substances , which help your body to combat the super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection with inc@@ lin@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; if you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations earlier , please inform your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a cream until you have problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a cream until the treatment is treat@@ ed. o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nose loop . &quot;
do not use more cream than your doctor . o Do not use more cream than your doctor . o Do not use more cream than your doctor . o Do not use more cream than your doctor . o If reactions occur after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream do not perform with a band@@ age or patches . o If reactions occur in the treated spot that will cause you severe in@@ convenience you wash the cream with a mild soap and water .
&quot; once the reactions are dropped , you can continue the treatment . o Inform@@ ing your doctor if they do not have a normal blood pattern &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , it can be expected with increased inci@@ dence of sw@@ elling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulty when re@@ trac@@ ting the fores@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; turn Al@@ dar@@ a cream not in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vag@@ ina ( vag@@ ina ) , the cer@@ vi@@ x ( cer@@ vi@@ x ) or within the anus ( after ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medicine for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
if you have inter@@ course during the infection with ti@@ lt warts in the genital area is the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after inter@@ course ( not before ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other drugs or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
bre@@ ast@@ feeding your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream not because it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine comes into breast milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different with ti@@ lt warts , bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin with the ti@@ lt warts and ru@@ b the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely removed . &quot;
men with ti@@ lt warts under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What do you have to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks , 5 days a week , add a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you don &apos;t feel comfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin respon@@ ds too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; a reduced number of blood cells can make you more sus@@ cep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to create a blue stain , or cause it to cause ab@@ norm@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you will significantly affect you or you notice side effects , which are not stated in this use information . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of these are lighter skin reactions , which re@@ lie@@ ve within approximately 2 weeks after treatment of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes in the application place ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , sw@@ elling , mold formation , skin disorder , bli@@ ster , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes in the application place ( blu@@ ep@@ rint , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , tender@@ ness , sw@@ elling , sw@@ elling , sc@@ ars , ul@@ cer@@ ation , heat feeling or dis@@ comfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous , c@@ logged nose , flu or flu @-@ like symptoms , depression , eye irrit@@ ation , sw@@ elling , limb@@ s , limb@@ s , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , G@@ AG@@ s ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or hospital , and patients may require appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;
&quot; in addition Michel is speaker at the Institute for Security Policy , University of Kiel , Germany and runs the site Sei@@ d@@ lers Sicherheitspolitik . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was examined , but its effectiveness was measured ( by examining its effect on reducing the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me sen@@ sed G@@ AG concentrations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( ob@@ serving more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , r@@ ash , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ y ( joint pains ) , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ y ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion point . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used for patients who may be highly sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will review all new information that may possibly be known , and possibly update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. permission to transport al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O m@@ amm@@ alian cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ sters of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient contributes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical setting , in the recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months starting at the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after prolonged inter@@ ruption , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after inter@@ ruption of treatment must be cau@@ tious . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tic ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion reactions .
&quot; in the case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion reactions , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is too weak . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be res@@ umed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 become ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the prec@@ eded response occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on breast milk , is recommended during the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the phase 3 study and extension with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often performed ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory passages and lungs in pre @-@ history , heavy reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial o@@ ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ desirable drug interactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with the most severe form of treatment and treatment duration up to 12 months reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , it came to a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of treatment . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature exit from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no immun@@ op@@ par@@ ution ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients who had never had ser@@ o@@ kon@@ os . &quot;
&quot; patients with lack of low antibodies showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ ke in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti@@ body @-@ ti@@ des a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a marginal and low @-@ neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to inci@@ dence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the replacement therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulating sub strate , and preventing further accumulation of the enzyme activity . &quot;
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ osom@@ es , most likely of man@@ tle 6 phosph@@ ate rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of the patients of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients with the plac@@ ebo group to improve lung function and ability shown in the table below . &quot;
&quot; in the open extension study , improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table . &quot;
the decrease in the expected pro@@ vision@@ ally FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ ic@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
&quot; within the first four weeks , a significant waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / m@@ g. cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was determined that remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;

a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed a normal mental development rate ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form were limited or even no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ dos@@ ation schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under 5 years was similar to those with older and less severely affected patients .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant , cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who had previously not been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies , as sole treatment . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( vitamin B2 ) and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the application of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic drug &quot; &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent dehy@@ d@@ ration ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , ab@@ used or decreased the dose . &quot;
the active form of telem@@ etry slow@@ ed the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide .
&quot; the conversion of telem@@ etry into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ ial end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9,@@ 3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7,@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous squ@@ am@@ ous cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta , were extended longer than with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. to permit A@@ lim@@ ta &apos;s involvement in the entire European Union . &quot;
each bottle must be sol@@ dered with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) on 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
&quot; in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ weight plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( K@@ OF ) is administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of K@@ OF than in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the telem@@ etry in@@ fusion on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma according to previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of K@@ OF is administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , the day before and on the day of the telem@@ etry administration and the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid can be given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ en , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period , as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive an intra@@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first P@@ emet@@ re dose as well as after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive telem@@ etry , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift , including differenti@@ ation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose inspection must take place taking place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood @-@ balance or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predicted therapeutic cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated accordingly to the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment . &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be ab@@ orted if in patients after 2 D@@ os@@ is@@ re@@ jects a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in the age of 65 years or over 65 years of age there is an increased by @-@ effectiveness co @-@ operation .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data to worry and effectiveness .
in clinical studies in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustments are necessary which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restri@@ ction of &gt; to the 1.5 times of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin level and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase levels of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold increase of the upper limit ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) is not studied specifically in the studies . &quot;
patients need to be monitored with regard to bone @-@ row suppression and telem@@ etry should not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality rate has reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutral phil@@ ology , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as they were observed in the preceding treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was considered if a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be treated with telem@@ etry , foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce the treatment of treated toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ oric acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and 2 days after therapy with telem@@ etry ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , intended for therapy with telem@@ etry , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time treatment for at least 5 days before the treatment , at the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with telem@@ etry ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred were appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ d@@ ration , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant amount of fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the erg@@ ometer in front of the telem@@ etry treatment will be possible . &quot;
&quot; 5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with telem@@ etry occasionally when this drug was usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated adhes@@ i@@ ves ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive ability through telem@@ etry , men should be advised before the treatment should be advised to obtain advice on the retention of the sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) can result in increased inci@@ dence of side effects . &quot;
therefore caution is recommended if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in a high dosage .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , at the day of therapy and reduction of 2 days after therapy with telem@@ etry ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , with long half @-@ time as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous use of telem@@ etry must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , at the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with telem@@ etry . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ative ratio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of telem@@ etry in pregnant women , but as with an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; telem@@ etry may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive ability through telem@@ etry , men should be advised before the start of the treatment to pick up advice on the sem@@ an@@ tics . &quot;

the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti @-@ di@@ abe@@ tics needs to be adjusted . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional pregnancy prevention measures , in order to prevent the failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on the interaction effects of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed . &quot;
&quot; when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick Val@@ ues ( internationally norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) may be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to supplement a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparations in order to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the treatment of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , observed a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug because the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 m@@ g. over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dence of the inci@@ dence of adverse events reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were volun@@ tar@@ ily reported to a population of un@@ certain@@ ties . &quot;
it is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to defici@@ encies in terms of possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 m@@ g. three times a day were administ@@ ered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the market launch reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects such as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported . &quot;
&quot; based on research on humans and animals , a quick rep@@ lication of the systemic effects that are attri@@ but@@ able to the li@@ mel@@ amine properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
&quot; the therapeutic effect is applied in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper th@@ inner than the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;

&quot; although in both studies , weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( source value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( source value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average variation was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( source value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( source value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ sed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in very low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , which was administ@@ ered by the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ ated dose , two major metaboli@@ tes were identified , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is applied in obes@@ e adults aged 18 with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
the BM@@ I helps you determine if you have a normal weight in relation to your body size or are over@@ weight .
&quot; even if these diseases do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should consult your doctor for a check @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; for each 2 kg body weight , which you lose within the framework of a diet , you can lose an additional kil@@ ogra@@ m using all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other drugs or have recently taken drugs , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used for organ transplan@@ ts , for severe rheum@@ ato@@ id arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . &quot;
oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The effect of oral @-@ growing funds for pregnancy prevention ( p@@ ill ) is weak@@ ened or cancelled if you have strong diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ he@@ a ) .
&quot; before taking all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use : • apply A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one to treat heart rhythm disorders . • apply Ac@@ arb@@ ose to treat diabetes . &quot;
&quot; ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and take medicine against high blood pressure , as possibly the dosage must be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; as you can set your cal@@ oric potential and surface boundaries , you can find out more helpful information on the blue pages in section 6 . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a meal or contain no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only act when the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in connection with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional considerations ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body &apos;s new eating habits , start before the first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
nutrition products are effective as you can understand what you eat as much you eat and it will likely be easier to change your dietary habits .
&quot; in order to make your target weight safe , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
eat low fat to reduce the likelihood of nutrition @-@ related effects ( see section 4 ) . • Search to move more before you start taking the capsules .
&quot; in advance , remember to ask your doctor if you are not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to physical activity . &quot;
&quot; • If you can &apos;t find any reduction in your weight after twelve weeks of use of all@@ i , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; under certain circumstances , you must stop taking all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you will significantly affect or you notice side effects , which are not stated in this use information . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects are related to the effect of the capsules together , resulting in increasing fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after treatment , since you may have not yet consistently reduced the fat percentage in diet . &quot;
&quot; learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods , and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended fat content ev@@ enly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal is not to take them in the form of a low @-@ fat primary court or a durable bed@@ side , as you might possibly have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
• The bottle contains two white sealed containers with SI@@ L@@ IC@@ A@@ GEL which serve to keep the capsules dry .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • Hyper@@ tension • Diabetes • Cardi@@ ovascular diseases • Cardi@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn gradually to eat health@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ le , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take a maximum per day . &quot;
note the tables below in this section below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; as a result of the effect of the capsule , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , it may mean that your body can &apos;t handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss while decreasing the likelihood of nutrition @-@ related effects . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight by 0.5 pounds a week , without fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot;
&quot; • For a permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat goals and keep it as well . • Sense is a nutrition diary with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Search to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of further information materials that can help you to eat cal@@ orie and low @-@ fat , and give guidelines to be physically active . &quot;
&quot; in conjunction with a program tailored to your type , you can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your goal weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the addition of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic medication ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects of this age group are not available enough .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient uses the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , which prevents the rec@@ ept@@ ors in the gut . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate dis@@ sol@@ ves for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in 24 hours after chemotherapy , no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Hel@@ pf@@ ul Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd. to appro@@ ve Alo@@ xi &apos;s involvement in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting caused by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colon , patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised to pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or that tends to leng@@ then such leng@@ th@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chemotherapy agent , Alo@@ xi should not be used to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hibited the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ph@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ Stat@@ e- concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pri@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , the simultaneous application of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ duc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ason and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ ox@@ ib , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences for the use of palm @-@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , the most frequent side effects were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least likely with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ struction ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions on the administration site ( burning , cur@@ ing , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were indicated in post @-@ marketing reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dose , similar frequency of adverse events , such as in the other dosage groups , were not observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to large distribution volumes , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably does not have an effective treatment with an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mc@@ g / m2 of d@@ ac@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time period 7.3 hours ) were received , which was given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ason . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received intra@@ ven@@ ously in day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials of indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ m@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. of administ@@ ered pal@@ m@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface at the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 m@@ g. every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean average ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % was observed between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the overall ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached a total ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared with a single intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was 0,@@ 75 m@@ g. higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism , have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enzy@@ mes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ min@@ ation After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt action , the total body clearance is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function failure , the terminal el@@ min@@ ation sh@@ als and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ le@@ os@@ et@@ ron increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , there is evidence that pal@@ m@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels only in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ generation and rep@@ ol@@ arization . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was repeated in approximately the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is low to humans . &quot;
&quot; the owner of this approval for the transport sector must inform the European Commission on the plans for the transport of the drug , as part of this decision . &quot;

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eus should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ t@@ ate , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference arz@@ tis &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and effectiveness of hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hep@@ atitis C patients , Al@@ ph@@ eon &apos;s efficacy was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference drug . &quot;
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
&quot; in addition Michel is speaker at the Institute for Security Policy , University of Kiel , Germany and runs the site Sei@@ d@@ lers Sicherheitspolitik . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed in the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug could not be sufficient . &quot;
the number of hep@@ atitis C patients who spoke to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease reg@@ ressed more patients than with the reference medic@@ ament ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test conducted in the study was not adequ@@ ately validated in the study of the question to what extent the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently validated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sting ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( crack or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and paraly@@ zed wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which were demon@@ stra@@ bly or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lus @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not affect this type of infections . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the skin area may not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
bacteria of the@@ Y@@ ers@@ ini@@ agen@@ us el@@ ic@@ it intestinal wall@@ inflamm@@ ation@@ and serious diarr@@ ho@@ eal disease as well as other afflic@@ tions in humans . this gen@@ us includes the@@ pl@@ ague path@@ ogen .
primary Indi@@ c@@ ator of the Eff@@ ic@@ acy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was termin@@ ated after the treatment ended .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin burns , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with s@@ ore wounds , about 90 % of the patients were treated to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that were demon@@ stra@@ bly or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job .
&quot; the Committee on Human Physi@@ cians ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh the risks of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected minor Laz@@ er@@ ations , Scra@@ m@@ bled or se@@ wed wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and consider an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection begins . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies with secondary infected wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ os@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected position occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ os@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected to be expected in vi@@ vo ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; 3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 m@@ g. k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % retin@@ ap@@ ati@@ ulin ano@@ be rose to a separate skin of healthy adult males by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not considered necessary when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown re@@ productive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the f@@ ö@@ ter@@ tal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the gift of systemic antibiot@@ ic .
&quot; in deciding whether bre@@ ast@@ feeding continued / termin@@ ated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go continued / ended , it should weigh between the use of bre@@ ast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common adverse side effect was irrit@@ ation on the date of administration , which was about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance produced by fer@@ mentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ a@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ a@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data points out that the engagement point ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding interface and the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
&quot; by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , blocking partly P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal education of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infection forms , advice should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ ati@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , ir@@ respective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; absorption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ano@@ inting was applied daily under occ@@ lusion and applied to weak@@ ened skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ano@@ inting twice a day for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was performed in days 3 or 4 in adults before the medi@@ ation and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the final application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic absorption at the human after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the retin@@ os@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ aboli@@ sm The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies of oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro @-@ check on gene mut@@ ation and / or chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro@@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were neither male nor female rats , signs of reduced fertility in oral dosage of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) : &quot;

&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated spot , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not use any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface that will be treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it is not expres@@ sly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ int@@ ment comes out of view on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice , if any complaints occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile band@@ age or a gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor advised you not to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic cap , containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix is used in the framework of a vacc@@ ine consisting of two doses , whereby protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be achieved after submission of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix should only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is ensured that the vacc@@ ine can be led out of two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refre@@ sher dose against hep@@ atitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis A or B vacc@@ ine may be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the approved vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix adults since 1996 and since 1997 approved vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix children .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administ@@ ered within one of three doses of existing vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the main indication for efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a protective anti@@ body concentrations one month after the last injection . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of the protective of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( ob@@ serving more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection site , red@@ ness , mat@@ ernity ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. appro@@ ving an agreement for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole &quot;
&quot; the stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered at the time of choice and the second dose is administ@@ ered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refre@@ sher for hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B is desired , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
the anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g and anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully secured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have appe@@ aled to a hep@@ atitis A vacc@@ ination , because they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 . for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vacc@@ ine , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ing scheme with the combination vacc@@ ine is recommended , the 360 EL@@ ISA Units are form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ um anti@@ body value , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ mus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ ale success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ots , since it can occur in these cases according to intra@@ mus@@ cular administration . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix was administ@@ ered in the second year in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us out@@ enz@@ ae type b vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined meas@@ ur@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or in patients with immun@@ ective defects , there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;

&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix were administ@@ ered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 up to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and maturity on a calculation base per vacc@@ ine ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ine cycle reported 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix , about 6@@ 3.8 % in the test subjects , who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable high ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ ine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ eness was low and comparable to those observed by the combination vacc@@ ine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine with 360 EL@@ ISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ ines , which reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with the combination vacc@@ ine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 - including 15 years , ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the rate conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. month 7 ) . &quot;

&quot; in the 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was increased , ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical comparison study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after completion of the full vacc@@ ine series ( i.e. , month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with a combination vacc@@ ine with 360 EL@@ ISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for people who were at the time of pri@@ ming between 12 and 15 years old , the per@@ sistence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ine . &quot;
the immun@@ reaction to both anti@@ gens was comparable to the hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
&quot; in a clinical study at 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the per@@ sistence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs anti@@ body antibodies 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ine is comparable to those in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ine scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year at the same time with the spin @-@ up of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us out@@ enz@@ ae type b vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ urer @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;

&quot; the hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in the waters contaminated by wast@@ ewater . &quot;
&quot; you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with hep@@ atitis A or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or feeling ill / feels ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms , which are similar to those of hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any ingredient of this vacc@@ ine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest itself by ju@@ icy skin r@@ ashes , breath or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you would like to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months , and before the preparation of the second vacc@@ ine ) . &quot;
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced amount of effective components per vacc@@ ine ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
&quot; the second vacc@@ ine of this vacc@@ ine with decreased content of effective components is usually administ@@ ered one month after the first dose , and should give you a vacc@@ ine protection against the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; sometimes ambient mood is spra@@ yed with persons suffering from severe bleeding disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child is under@@ going a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Tell your doctor if you / your child receives more medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) , or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has received / has received or has been planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible different limb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vacc@@ ine is still adequate . &quot;
&quot; usually , ambi@@ ance pregn@@ ancies or bre@@ ast@@ feeding women are not given , except it is urgent that they can be vacc@@ inated against hep@@ atitis A as well as hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les , and in packages up to 50 without need@@ les . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the data which has been known since the distribution of the first auth@@ orization for the Inland Railway , the CH@@ MP represented the view that the value @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was only brought into circulation in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient ex@@ position . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with an in@@ exhaus@@ tible enzyme defect or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high am@@ mon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
&quot; am@@ mon@@ ia is divided into several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or via a g@@ astro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach of leading tube ) or a nose probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as am@@ mon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , imp@@ air@@ ment , fluid retention , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the committee for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ ia was effectively prevented in patients with mal@@ functions of the ure@@ a cycle to high am@@ mon@@ ia levels .
am@@ mon@@ ia was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information to this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme deficiency already manifest in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ um form ( complete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests after the first week of life ) , there is an indication for the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ esis there is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary enc@@ ephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ules . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose is sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight more than 20 kg , plus adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fol@@ ate deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ alysts lack need ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0,4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , because there is a risk for the emergence of o@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be applied only with caution in patients with con@@ gestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate on the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during bre@@ ast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events had assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ opic patient , which developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ al tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed dose @-@ limiting ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound composed by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate that is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
&quot; 5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate nit@@ rate . &quot;
it is important that diagnosis is made early and the treatment will start immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease itself was leading to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ ues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative methods of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with a lot of mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical deficits . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , and afterwards treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
existing neuro@@ logical deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ dised to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine and phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate is produced .
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( un@@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes was also examined in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after the intake of meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma next morning after ni@@ ghtly fast@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no la@@ sto@@ genic effects ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , who do not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a g@@ astro@@ stom@@ i@@ ost@@ omy or a nose probe . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose is sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ born , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight more than 20 kg , plus adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of am@@ mon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fol@@ ate deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metaboli@@ te of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the brain channel . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ opic patient , which developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ al tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess excess
&quot; on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate nit@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; existing neuro@@ logical deficits are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after the intake of meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once a period of 3 months at a temperature of less than 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spoon is 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzy@@ mes are missing , so they can not ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory investigations . &quot;
&quot; if you use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other drugs or have recently taken drugs , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during bre@@ ast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , fla@@ vors , inci@@ dence of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you find one of these symptoms , contact your doctor or your hospital for introduction of appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forget the intake of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in blood balance ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes ) , reduced appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin odor , skin r@@ ash , kidney dys@@ function , weight gain and an@@ om@@ al laboratory values . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you will significantly affect or you notice side effects , which are not stated in this use information . &quot;
&quot; after that , you can no longer use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS after that on the cart@@ on and container . &quot;
&quot; like AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval shape , and they are equipped with the em@@ bos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other drugs or have recently taken drugs , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; you should use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS over the same single doses or over a stomach fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose , which runs straight into the stomach ) or a nose prob@@ es ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; • If you take a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove surplus gran@@ ules . • Remove the recommended number of spo@@ ons of gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ogen@@ esis is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example , with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest basket with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ - up@@ lift &quot; &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measured value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ogen@@ esis is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ogen@@ ic an@@ gi@@ ox was compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI the patient often was a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and asp@@ ir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; for this@@ you need the@@ Acrobat Reader , that you can download here . Pre@@ cont ® ... &quot;
&quot; in patients having a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was equally effective in terms of all indicators as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din , other her@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it may not be applied to patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack . &quot;
the committee for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox was an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to permit an approval of An@@ gi@@ ox &apos;s involvement in the entire European Union . &quot;
for treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) for emergency intervention or early intervention .

&quot; if the patient is subsequently performed a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be res@@ umed for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of an all@@ ine bolt of an@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI operation is planned . &quot;
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to 225 seconds , should be a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitution and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bol@@ us@@ dose is rapidly administ@@ ered intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restri@@ ction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
the ACT @-@ value below 225 seconds is a second Bol@@ us@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg and once again check the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ dose .
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage that was included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT score was 5 minutes after the application of the bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us with an average of 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ treated patients an@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ized He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• severe un@@ controll@@ able hyper@@ tension and acute blood pressure due to a mal@@ function of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible blood pressure . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored in terms of symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even though in PCI patients , most bleeding in arter@@ ial punc@@ ture points may occur in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment generally occurs everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ valent ir@@ regul@@ arities , a monitoring of the IN@@ R Wer@@ ts ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value of the treatment with bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din is again achieved prior to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mers ) , these agents may increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in combination of bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameter in each case is regularly controlled . &quot;
&quot; the animal experiments are inadequate in relation to pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , ab@@ etting or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ized He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group , as well as in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , were more common in women as well as for patients over 65 years more frequently than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding were defined according to the Ac@@ u@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; ac@@ u@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the spot , reducing hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl without obvious bleeding , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ alis@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with a bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed in table 6 according to system organ@@ - classes . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din is immediately removed and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ mbo@@ sis inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cat@@ aly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ions @-@ related region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , ir@@ respective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in liquid phase or t@@ inned . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly sp@@ litt@@ ing the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din was used to indu@@ ce thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and patients , bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ or@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect caused by leng@@ th@@ ening of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm , or inj@@ ected as permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or does not process insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin is very slightly different from the human insulin and the change means that it works faster and shorter working hours than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body can not produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body can not effectively processed insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indication for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin @-@ spr@@ int . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra have to be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH to permit A@@ pi@@ dra &apos;s involvement in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the del@@ tam@@ i@@ tic or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal cavity . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin dose , insulin needs to be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function . &quot;
&quot; all changes in the volume , the brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink delays etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can draw up a change in insulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 An inadequate dosage or break of treatment , especially in patients with ins@@ ul@@ in@@ able diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision , and can make a change in dosage . &quot;
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia is dependent on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; the substances that increase blood glucose levels and ampli@@ fy the inc@@ lin@@ ation to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ op@@ y@@ rami@@ ds , fi@@ br@@ ates , fluor@@ ine ox@@ ides , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen@@ yl , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate , and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the effect of sympath@@ etic agents such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and Reser@@ va can be weak@@ ened or missing the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti @-@ regulation . &quot;
&quot; no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sm occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it rec@@ or@@ ised after oral use . &quot;
&quot; the following are listed in clinical trials , listed according to system organ@@ - classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; cold sweat , cool and pale skin , ti@@ red@@ ness , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual fatigue or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dog , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection site . &quot;
&quot; heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by an intra@@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a trained person , or by intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after a glucose inj@@ ections , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin the effect occurs faster and the effect duration is shorter than with hu@@ g@@ man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus insulin lu@@ li@@ sin showed a disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ately glu@@ cos@@ yl@@ ating effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ately rise in glu@@ cos@@ yl@@ ating effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has twice as fast action as normal human insulin and achiev@@ es the full glu@@ cos@@ yl@@ ating effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ den@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ emic control is achieved as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was obtained for 2 minutes before the meal was obtained a better post@@ pran@@ di@@ al control than with a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
&quot; insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ emic control is given as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin during the application of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin during the application 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to humane Nor@@ - mal@@ ign@@ ant which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
