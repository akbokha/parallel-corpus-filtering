<seg id="1">"the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Department report (EPAR), in which the Committee of Human Physicians (CHMP) has judged the trials carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug."</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist."</seg>

<seg id="5">"• Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder in which the patient can have various episodes (periods of abnormal mood) alternating with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if oral use of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used or the melting tablets in patients can be used to treat the swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, just like Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aritriprazole presumably acts as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aritriprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitter acts to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aritriprazole contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was examined in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared with 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which led to increased unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, in another study compared to 160 patients where the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder caused by increased unrest, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the changes in the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorised the melting tablets and the solution to take into account.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg, or 15 mg, significantly reduced the symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled sugars), trembling, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Physicians (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes in which the manic episodes had addressed the treatment with Aritriprazole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution during rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. to permit Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the Bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients showing mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aritriprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day in a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day each day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once a day, irrespective of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aria prazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changes of an antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">"results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased suicidal risk with Aritriprazole compared to other antipsychotics."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aritriprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure-lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acelated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia appearing during the treatment with Aritriprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if one with abilify treated patients signs signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aritriprazole should be used in patients with convulsions in the anamnesis or in cases associated with convulsions in connection with caution."</seg>

<seg id="43">"however, there was one of these studies, a study with fixed doses, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events associated with aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma, or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify."</seg>

<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aritriprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Ariel prazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the resorption rate of Aritriprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased by 107%, while CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolizers, the common application of highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common application of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of abilify should be raised to the Dosishöhe prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>

<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aritriprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to insufficient data for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in animal reproductive studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk of the fetus."</seg>

<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood glucose levels and amplify the inclination to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diopyramids, fibrates, fluorine oxides, propoxyphenyllin, propoxyphenyl, salizylate, and sulfonamide-antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, the effect of sympathetic agents such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserva can be weakened or missing the symptoms of adrenergic anti-regulation."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"no differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin-lulism occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it recorised after oral use."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"the following are listed in clinical trials, listed according to system organ- classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000; &lt; 1 / 1,000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000; &lt; 1 / 1,000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000; &lt; 1 / 1,000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000)."</seg>

<seg id="2990">"heavy hypoglycemias can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucose injections, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the effect duration is shorter than with hugmanem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus insulin lulisin showed a disproportionately glucosylating effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionately rise in glucosylating effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast action as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosylating effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable post-dendiale glycaemic control is achieved as with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin lulisin was obtained for 2 minutes before the meal was obtained a better postprandial control than with a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"insulin-lulisin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is given as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- grooves before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
