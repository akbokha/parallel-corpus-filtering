&quot; you can translate the module site in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select the menu under ex@@ tras page , select the output and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part of the whole &amp; URL is translated . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations will not make important decisions without checking the translation beforehand . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish site itself , where you can insert translated texts directly . &quot;
package package ; includes different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size they offer some additional features and simpli@@ fy the use of some of the functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; this is easier to use .
&quot; for more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and find the built @-@ in functions in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &quot;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Extensions ... To open the card map tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have installed additional software .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available , delete . &quot;
the check@@ sum module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with ex@@ tras checking filter . you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to view DOM tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Extras DOM tree ... and open a new window with the DOM of the just displayed web site . as default , the display with the root node of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various symbolic and text views to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in sp@@ ed structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is propor@@ tionally to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of entries in it . therefore , it can be easily recognized if it is far below in the folder hier@@ archy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View@@ .@@ as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UN@@ IX ; command you may be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ e@@ Map view is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have reasonable color geb@@ ing- and labelling options . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched via View Color mode can either display depth to the light detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the relative position of the caption in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in the Tre@@ e@@ Map in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always maintained . &quot;
&quot; as division of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will be left to the implementation . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the area for an entry on the menu entry view . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View@@ II was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map @-@ wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ rind . &quot;

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . of course , every medium and any card reader , supported by your operating system , will work together with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; contains fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE image plugins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills available . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens that can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end user . therefore , you should report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; if you are in the program , your browser opens a page in the bug report system . if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the bug report system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developers are able to answer each other . &quot;
&quot; you can also visit the digi@@ kam , home page for news on shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate in the developer mailing list . how to login in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ kam ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the file name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want to add . &amp; digi@@ kam ; you will also use as an alpha library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , which contains images , as base folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ ably recur@@ sively searches the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclu@@ de sub@@ folders , unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . this allows you to insert an item in front of the sub@@ folder name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have photos as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . &quot;
&quot; the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ c@@ amer@@ a@@ Support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of raw de@@ coder settings and root workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . of course , every medium and any card reader , supported by your operating system , will work together with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; modern digital cameras are used by using Compact &amp; Flash , Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ kam ; uses g@@ photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ photo@@ 2 is a free , further distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which is an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . because photos in general are large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created using li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am . if the database support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see preview images or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy to expand its functionality through modules :
&quot; ki@@ pi modules : the K@@ DE image plug @-@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules of all graphics programs . the configuration for the ki@@ pi modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to complement &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drawing and removing images works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the tree , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Films and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name only works if this ind window displays icon view . which fields are displayed , you can configure the alarm settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ ads ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos taken by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ qualities or after the date the album was created , the date can be changed to the album &apos;s properties . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can choose to move the photo with the mouse to the target album and fall there . in the then appearing menu , you will have to choose whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to include information about this collection . to access the album properties , you have to click on the album and edit album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; alb@@ um@@ - collections : are one method to select your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make it in the settings for collections . &quot;
&quot; Keywords : Billy Talent , Greenfield , festival , live , stage , band , Interlaken , Switzerland , 20090@@ 613 , Shelley Jambresic &quot;
&quot; the buttons El@@ ders , Me@@ an , New Year : these set the date to the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you first started an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first image in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ c ; sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be scre@@ ened .
the collection includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window gives you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo will appear in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album the first time , you need to wait briefly while the thumbnail images are generated . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the preview . what information do this , you can change the digi@@ kam settings ; click here the Albums page and adjust the thumbnail images to your preferences . &quot;
&quot; the thumbnail images feature a help window . if you want to rest a moment over a picture , the help shows the most important features including all the keywords . the screen shot above in the main window displays such a help window . &quot;
&quot; photos are all that works at &amp; digi@@ kam ; go . albums and keywords , allow you to organize your images as it fits . you can preview all the features that come with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can have the choice between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image editing with a photo by viewing either F@@ 4 image ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... select a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with the image editing , you can view your photos and change them . &quot;
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button , and select the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening . to do this , and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after editing by other image processing programs , you may have problems with the met@@ adata in the image . some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . this allows you to save this information from EX@@ IF and IPTC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a picture , you can click the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the m@@ ül@@ lei@@ derer of &amp; k@@ de ; postpon@@ ed . F@@ 8 image delete or de@@ f if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Use . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My dates sli@@ t ; organiz@@ es your photos based on data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog@@ u@@ ize your photos . as soon as a keyword is assigned to a photo , the photo can be found through the selection of this keyword or search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos shown with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; you can also organize parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword lists , so that you can find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IPTC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking on the right mouse button , or click on an existing keyword , and select new keyword . if you click on a new keyword once you click on an existing keyword , this is the sign of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and lay there . then a menu will appear , which gives you the possibility to push the keyword . a keyword can only be a time only once in the tree . &quot;
&quot; you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button , and edit the keyword menu keyword . you can change the name of the keyword and symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; digi@@ kam ; s functionality with keywords , you first have to provide your photos with keywords . this can be done on two ways : once you have searched the photos you want with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords to him . this way , you can find a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this is displayed below the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you open the context menu of the photos and select Remove from the menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustment hist@@ ogra@@ m of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved via this hist@@ ogra@@ m . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the lower right corner of the box that gives the time unit . this allows all associated images to be displayed in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below . &quot;
&quot; include all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click on this , the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search has not found , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs on the left side bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters you as search crit@@ erion . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your choice , press OK and search will be done . the results will be displayed in the view My search list in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to edit your search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the search results previously entered . if you choose to edit as extended search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides you an extended search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules are displayed by operators separate , listed . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group . each option can be added with other information about logical operations all ... , One ... , No ... or Min@@ least ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two frame signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is a range in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of un@@ ch@@ ew search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and digi@@ kam ; find the appropriate images .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble miniature program . you can click in or zo@@ oming out and move it . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ coder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add to the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; from the preview strip , you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you what copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly extract from a picture series . if you are using p@@ airing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the fields to compare . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal sol@@ dering processes work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side panel of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table . this makes it easy to connect visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to bend the visible area of the image , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area . &quot;
&quot; the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the zoom control under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; click the mouse wheel to zo@@ oming into the picture . this happens in both pictures , if you are in the mode of preview . &quot;
&quot; what is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process following the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure your images , find , protect and use photos . we consider downloading , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group@@ ing , backup , optimize , wait and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
met@@ adata is defined as data about data . met@@ adata can be used in accordance with your definition data that will provide information about or documentation of other data that are administ@@ ered by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t want to know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t want to know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
the first thing you do and know before you cultivate something into your system is the building information structure in contrast to the data structure .
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly about your location , unless you were in one year several times in the same place . the rest of the photos will be used by your date . if you are enough pictures , you will be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements , such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate files from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies securing strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ adata settings in the Settings page of the met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ kam . this makes sure EX@@ IF and IPTC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? to do that &amp; digi@@ kam ; they provide a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , since you should now select every photo of keywords , lab@@ eling and an assessment . of course , you can select all images that need the same attribute and then set the value . &quot;
all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
&quot; if you import kat@@ alog@@ ri@@ fied images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically set the tree for you and paste the images in the right place . the change of the hier@@ archy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling a sub@@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is over@@ done . this is a very rough representation , as each block of met@@ adata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are all features of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of keywords - the next section refers to let@@ tering or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you want to share your photos just simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I &apos;ll tell you this the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach &amp; quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dreaming of having associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the let@@ tering has changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it is the strength only with a let@@ tering for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save it as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to exploit ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already countless and will be even deeper into the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can replic@@ ate your travels virtual by means of images with ge@@ ographic data . you can also export k@@ m@@ l. files that can also export k@@ ml files that you can export with Google Maps . you can also export k@@ m@@ l. files to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam , which should be stored as information : &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , for example , to use the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples can be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the dealer field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a stock photo , then the group / agency will be shown here . &quot;
&quot; the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important for individuals and semi @-@ professionals . &quot;
&quot; in the near future , the digital water@@ mark is unique . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for for@@ kli@@ ft processing in the near future . &quot;
&quot; themes : plate error , plate failure , power sho@@ cks , ECC , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , dis@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that went on the street or a fire . this type of loss is the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics , which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these careful treatment must be treated and you may not be trusted for more than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers on gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . therefore , the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just written it . that &apos;s why they use a control sum@@ mation mechanism to protect itself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and control sum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; there are also similar applications to read damaged dis@@ ks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
IPTC : caption Dre@@ dg live at the Greenfield Festival in Interlaken ( Switzerland ) on June 13th 2009 . IPTC : Copyright Notice Copyright by Shelley Jambresic .
&quot; slowly burn with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ proprietary format . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media , before you can copy the last piece of hardware or software to read this media . &quot;
&quot; disk producers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer warranty cover a new disk , but not the data . &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , SM@@ ART cannot determine this error . some of SM@@ ART errors are the most common error reason , SM@@ ART cannot determine this error . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; this can cause serious damage to your computer . at your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . thus , you can use these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es blocked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so , protect yourself from the un@@ avo@@ idable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy supply and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , remember that not every plug @-@ in bar contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to tel@@ eph@@ ony lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms , also for tel@@ eph@@ ony lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also have a telephone connection for your mo@@ dem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mo@@ dem and the TV chart . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from small fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of just a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically make battery energy available when a power failure occurs . &quot;
&quot; a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W UPS can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . finally , you should always remember all cables before you go to the holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the hard drives at home , however , very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your images in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data security , web solutions are very secure . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that are able to handle and scal@@ able with disk failures . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms , and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % on job systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lesser damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has been no longer sigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file is not saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes for data loss . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it means that while technology continues to evolve , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ els sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ apixel . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; 6 % of all PCs are affected each year by a data loss . so , secure your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything at any risk such as installing your operating system , replacing plates or the size of dis@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you take your backup on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash , you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aviation gap : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbouring house , in your office or the like . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a loss of data is panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save it one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ating backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot of two time points : the full backup and the last differenti@@ ation .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that have been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
get important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
&quot; this approach gives you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you have a complete daily release of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;
&quot; themes : met@@ adata stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding images and met@@ adata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to look at all what is said today with caution and re@@ assess during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less versions you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and convert it to a newer standard . stay open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means that it is always increasing .
&quot; for * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and store them on a new record : &quot;
&quot; check the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang them . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a colon by it@@ sel@@ f. you can escape it as &quot; &quot; \ : &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , you can create it yourself . this task will be simpler from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG was designed as an open source standard , but it is much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IPTC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( defl@@ ate ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . &quot;
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format that was developed by Adobe Systems . DNG was developed based on the need to standardi@@ ze camera @-@ format formats . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using met@@ adata . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using met@@ adata .
&quot; this is probably one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe released its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block &amp; quot ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ ulas ; , a blend of XML and R@@ DF . it is an identification technology that allows users to embed their data into a file . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo , mostly in raw format , to archive . however , X@@ MP adap@@ ts as it stores the met@@ adata separately from the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include the work on an architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ kam , you should add the met@@ adata again . &quot;
&quot; use the processed images for copy@@ rights with a digital water@@ mark . export them first into web galleries , code in m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; you will find a description of how you can add photos that you have already on your hard drive . however , the camera interface will provide you with many advanced settings to import images to your database database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , connect them to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and switch it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not show thumbnails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for the application of any file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and photo information , which will be stored internally by the camera . &quot;
&quot; this information is the same as the met@@ adata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection from all . this downloads all photos from their camera into one single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted , and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can only select the selected using the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , you can download the button download and then download selected . the selected button download is checked as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these pictures have been downloaded until now , so you can download the new pictures with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , you will only download the new images . &quot;
&quot; if you can download the buttons all or download selected , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos will be placed . the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folder . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; download the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the photos you downloaded , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Delete All . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ kam ; -@@ album downloaded before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera file , you should check this over the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can be useful , the date and time when the picture was taken to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically . &quot;
&quot; the options during transfer opens three more options , which will be executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate to the author in the default auto @-@ identity section . if you choose this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the IPTC data . using the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use another date format as the standard format , e.g. in the editing box , you can use the pre@@ fix f@@ oto@@ - % Y % d % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option to date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name option , you have the possibility to download the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name given the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of camera at the time point of recording , and not all cameras provide this information . in the met@@ adata section you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , digi@@ kam makes it possible . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has information about the date the photo was made available , and digi@@ kam , you can automatically create signatures in the target album . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same under@@ album . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is download . then select High Load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de , appears in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder , and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Positioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position that can be displayed in length and latitude and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be used by the american GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European G@@ AL@@ I@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an air@@ plane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten about where exactly the photo was made , you can click a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam ; users who want to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to save the location data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how does the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transmitt@@ ing data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be used with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you have to store these data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic assignment module . &quot;
&quot; there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can find the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the length and latitude degrees or other data , then you can use this script using the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool of Phil Harvey . it uses the signs of ha@@ iry co @-@ ordin@@ ates that are created for example by Map@@ s.@@ Google . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . in order to access these settings , you have to choose from the settings digi@@ kam ; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; when you click on an entry in the main view , you can select the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields , when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; auth@@ orization is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as photograph@@ ed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo offers . this must not be the author if it works for a news agency , such as Reuters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be registered here . if the picture is a repository photo , then the group and the agency should be listed here . &quot;
IPTC actions save the data in the corresponding IPTC field . this is achieved that the met@@ adata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; image lab@@ eling as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , including images embedded in pictures . this allows your let@@ tering to be read by other image viewers . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cur@@ sor rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; see , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button up to the right of each category .
&quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image will use a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool bar when you use the editing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the picture . in the image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia , to the closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with setting PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , since PNG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . &quot;
&quot; convert the defl@@ ate -@@ compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality , since the defl@@ ate algorithm works loss @-@ free . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save losses . even if you select the loss@@ less setup , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . &quot;
&quot; in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , the image processing was only one image viewer for photos . at present , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . this dialog allows you to change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws a little soft , eliminating the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera will be used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposure pictures can get more details in the sh@@ utter . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the top lights , so the parts of your pictures are burned out because of the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top lights as a continuous white . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the re@@ construct option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adapted individually for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be made later in the image options of the digi@@ kam ; this can also be done later in the image options of the digi@@ kam ; you should go conserv@@ atively . &quot;
this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction .
&quot; and digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ N@@ G inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as it is carried out during the conversion . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as colour information from a color space in the other , so that colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; color Profile folder S@@ etting the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , in which you all save your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; analyze this folder during the start . &quot;
&quot; you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ad ; for your profiles , everything can be changed when opening the raw file later . &quot;
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . only your pictures are not managed to manage the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be made to the camera manufacturer and model you can use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping or g@@ amma correction . this means that you have to perform the color mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate how your image would be given by a device . this is very useful before you print image , because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile for them is intended for . unfortunately , not with Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here &apos;s a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon Profile extension makes the style for the destination : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; ki@@ pi is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image processing . by delivering this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work together with any program that supports the ki@@ pi interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the ki@@ pi modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; . &quot; &quot;
more information ( in English ) about ki@@ pi modules can be obtained via the ki@@ pi project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the ki@@ pi modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the top regulator adju@@ sts the time between the transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show a list of all currently supported cameras on the left hand side . on the right hand side there is a button Auto detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B- and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) storage cameras . this field will only be active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera with your computer , bring it into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can manually set camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any designation for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the confirmation dialog for moving images in the m@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting one album . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be sil@@ ently applied by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply , if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to update the changes to the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also sign the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; at boot , this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up process of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; if something from the base folder was deleted , &amp; digi@@ kam , you asked whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different colour schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can choose the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find further information on this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos , and for correc@@ ting and improvement . &quot;
&quot; the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them stand as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you are not part of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common features required . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved file storage or button saving from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so , you should make a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file saving . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re @-@ producing or using the button &quot; &quot; Rest@@ ore the button &quot; &quot; to restore the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last save . &quot;
&quot; almost any action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or re @-@ established . the last action can undo you , by editing reverse , res@@ ett@@ able , by selecting re@@ produce from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should undo the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; then press a moment more about the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are also revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter in the photo and zo@@ oms in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the An@@ si@@ eur menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode . you &apos;ll come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you don &apos;t want this , you can view this in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print image in the picture file and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sets . &quot;
&quot; the same page bar is available , without the navigation paths , also available in the image gallery . it will be displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the page bar appear and disappear again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IPTC data backs only ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are transformed . if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you have submitted it , use either the button to apply or simply switch to the next image , the lab@@ eling will be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the application button , you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata in the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a met@@ adata settings that is always written into the images . &quot;
&quot; the app@@ rais@@ al shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single click to the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the assessment is written in the IPTC &apos; Ur@@ gency Plan &apos; . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keywords tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; the password tree will be adjusted dynam@@ ically to the entered search word . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful , if you have many keywords . &quot;
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keyword words in a picture series . if you have entered several keywords , they are saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC @-@ field keyword .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view , and select a keyword in the keywords tree , this is only applied to the generated image and not applied to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the password filters are used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . &quot;
&quot; if the keyword is already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears , which asks you whether you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or more , you can easily double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key term , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can define an extended search of all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is the colours that have been photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned by your camera or scanner . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are identical to those of your camera or sc@@ anners , and that the colours you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information will enable you to make informed decisions about your own informed decisions so you can get the desired results . &quot;
&quot; if your workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; your only other image editions are via email or web , where s@@ RGB is de @-@ facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so simple , why should one use another color gam@@ ut and thus have to worry about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hu@@ g @-@ shaped region , and colours in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colours , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then Information About RGB working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to cali@@ br@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cali@@ br@@ ate your monitor as s@@ RGB works . if you are working as a colour gam@@ ut of s@@ RGB , you will need to cali@@ br@@ ate your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , using a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best at your photo . if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ osity value over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; like this : this method adju@@ sts the color of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . &quot;
&quot; automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue duct . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ be of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible in full @-@ blown images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly limited to a color gam@@ ut with 8 bits per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left @-@ hand side , both the original picture and the preview of the target picture are adjusted . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as vertical line in hist@@ ogra@@ m .
&quot; at the top , a hist@@ ogra@@ m shows that dynamic changes will be changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . &quot;
&quot; to play anst@@ ate with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is shown in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons store as and store are exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set , you can save it into a text file and load it later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will be shown as your original . if you store them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . but this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
&quot; this tool gives the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the H@@ elli@@ es . a detailed instructions for using color profiles , you can consult the chapter &quot; &quot; Colour Management &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this tool provides an integrated way to store multiple color channels at the same time , allowing you to use it for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
&quot; a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provide you four color effects , a solar panel effect , a vel@@ via filter , a neon effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when you completed a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this was the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar @-@ ization effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a reverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
&quot; the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates neon light on the contrast edges . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the neon light . in large pictures , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s not unusual to change color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you are applied . &quot;
&quot; if you can make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too great satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can do in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , the active channel or the selected range . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the kno@@ b , and take care of how the picture changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box , you can set the hist@@ ogra@@ m with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ holes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones . moreover , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values as in the input values .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
&quot; save as and store : with these buttons , the set values stored in the file system can be stored and re@@ loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Lev@@ els format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , medium and sun sets . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the hist@@ ogra@@ m for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of adjusting the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the origin@@ als and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a cur@@ v@@ eil to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond to darker output tones and darker will be darker . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the original photos is a red marker . if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each turn you have created can be saved in the file system and then be loaded later . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medi@@ um@@ - and sun@@ screen . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposure pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photograph taken in the L@@ umin@@ ance Canal . shadow and sun@@ flowers were set with the paint pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the color channel @-@ mixer of the image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first hint as you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position them in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogra@@ m to show you the appropriate colour value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are below : controls for red , green and construction allows you to mix these channels . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix mono@@ chrome , the reduction of a color to a visible noise leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space . if this is the case , you can improve your mono@@ chrome conversion in which you first reduce the colour space first . &quot;
&quot; the saving as and loading buttons are used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you later , and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography always was fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction ability . in the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be converted simply on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 Co@@ kin ( tm ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filtered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter .
yellow Filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( tm ) yellow filter .
&quot; Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm @-@ bright and medium tones as it adds a little cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and the re @-@ development in a sep@@ tic oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother , and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop Art Portrait from enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry Picture texture can be used for this . &quot;
relief : shift this parameter to the right raises the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the relief is set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture . &quot;
this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ attering eye . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ attering eye . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . the picture with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , enclosed with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : is the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this is important for the printing of images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio before use . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture of any place . this is also possible in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text alignment , orientation , color from color space and character set with its properties as you need . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you press &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; after the image has been saved , the text part is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool sten@@ cil , you can put a template on an image . &quot;
the menu image template can be used in the image processing can be used to lay st@@ encils over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the size of the template . if you want to add your template to the template , simply send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your s@@ lon@@ card folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the file files . these settings will be noticed for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder was set for the templates , a tree view mirrors the folder structure of the sten@@ cil template . &quot;
&quot; the preview contains three buttons , which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button increases the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; size : this button sh@@ red@@ ds the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the image below the template . take the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the preview size .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , three different tools are available for shar@@ p@@ ness . each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
&quot; re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three , since it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adap@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; images without focus , and most digital images require a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; JPEG pictures often have a camera internal shar@@ p@@ ness . images in the raw format , on the other hand , have to be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; if you disable this , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo using the shar@@ pen@@ ing tool . this can be used with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in general , the most useful technique is to focus on the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique is to re@@ focus the tool . in general , the most useful technique is to re@@ focus the tool . you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ p@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to draw soft@@ eners with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ation soft draw and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview will help you to edit the image . the preview window shows the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tried first . &quot;
&quot; high resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore , you should be able to shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wis@@ er picture , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimal difference can be defined for an edge of the filter . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ urred filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp masks were used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus an image by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected design filter -@@ algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtering . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is using a shar@@ p@@ ness mask .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which depends on the mathematical result from the source pixel , which is far from the original source pixel . &quot;
circular edge : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module .
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , and eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß shar@@ p@@ ness . use this parameter if your shar@@ p@@ ness Gau@@ ß is . in most cases , you should have this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero zero , you may also increase the correlation and / or the addi@@ tive filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . increasing the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circle @-@ shaped shar@@ p@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter that you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try all the cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before modi@@ fying the picture . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , and eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , Un@@ sharp masks produce better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ ushing a larger neighborhood as a shar@@ p@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in theory , un@@ sharp masks must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of the shar@@ p@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied to a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
this picture was made with an an@@ alogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods for shar@@ pen@@ ing in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the regulator smooth@@ es the shar@@ p@@ ness of the area that was dark@@ ened to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
&quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool error correction is one of the wid@@ est developed tool to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ IM@@ G project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . &quot;
&quot; direction dependency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ding or CCD noise , a high value wave @-@ like pattern will produce a high value . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all . p defines the relative smoothing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle step@@ width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small . &quot;
&quot; integ@@ r@@ als &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step@@ width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing , and never greater than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by choosing this option is only low , but it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we recommend it to let it out . &quot;
&quot; the buttons store as and store are exactly this . each setting of image errors can be rec@@ tified in a text file , and later re@@ loaded . &quot;
&quot; correct image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how picture errors can be removed with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the for@@ eg@@ round , that caused by a bad film overlay during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ tic ; the effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen shot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the advanced settings can remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; Radi@@ us controls window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubric@@ ation occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge precision for shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , don &apos;t remove all noise or noise sp@@ ik@@ es . set it to a value close to the maxim@@ um if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG image file without losing details . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ance : controls the brightness tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process , which is controlled by the details settings . &quot;
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ ut tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically shar@@ pen@@ ed , but also poll@@ utes the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ it@@ tery atten@@ uation . this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius re@@ acts on variations of lumin@@ ous density . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . &quot;
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction has been applied to standard settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture . use a tool to draw soft@@ eners with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ation soft draw and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gra@@ bbing , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ IM@@ G project .
&quot; JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss@@ ary compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; the buttons store as and store are exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file , and later re@@ loaded . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been taken to an illi@@ ford ( tm ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ bbing on the faces .
&quot; below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows users to remove Hot@@ pixels from photos with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels &amp; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ ay ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark picture . the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark picture directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark picture to the picture . &quot;
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas .
select an area to view the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; cu@@ bic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cu@@ bic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cub@@ ical curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; vi@@ gn@@ ment correction is a tool to correct vi@@ gn@@ ment , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ g@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ orten ) it the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 while the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects are caused by motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using a c@@ enter@@ filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controls , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ ment correction filter and with three further exposure to the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of intensity absorption at the point of the greatest density the filter . the default density is 2,0 , which is equivalent to an optical filter with a aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , or acci@@ dentally a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , relaxing . Incre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ ment , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you will need to adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the digi@@ kam ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gil@@ ding correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ ment in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ous intensity and contrast correction was also performed with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . color distortion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ vex shape of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ der has a similar loop effect , flat but on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; when you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distortion can be virtually eliminated . &quot;
&quot; in general : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of distortion of fourth gra@@ dient . this value is stronger in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ enti@@ ls , the &apos; corners parameters have the inver@@ ted sign of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value is scal@@ ding the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image dimin@@ ishes .
&quot; bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview the correction correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the barrel or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . if you cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ like correction , the effect is apparently the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the barrel @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs , such as pictures from front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film from the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ u.@@ org web site which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( tm ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters to set film gra@@ bbing and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option of joining film gra@@ bbing if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gra@@ bbing and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; due to the filter color channels for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green duct , it does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film gra@@ ding is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ bbing on your images . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films such as B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , and to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix big silver particles of the photographic emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ gra@@ bbing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mono@@ chrome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , even though higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ bbing effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processed the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity equivalent to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature images and style lives are good for this effect .
&quot; the top el@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brush is better for large images . smooth controls the smoothing , or from the other side , the shar@@ p@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ete is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel is 1 and smoothing 17 .
images of their gra@@ dient slowly change are not ideal for this effect .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top regulator cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoothing ) .
this is an example of the carbon label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the standard settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further enhanced by adap@@ ting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter En@@ grav@@ ur shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where colour is not the most important . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to turn the picture into a grey and mon@@ stro@@ us landscape .
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; wave Blocks 1 : divide the image into cells , and let it look like it is considered by glass blocks . &quot;
&quot; wave Blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using non @-@ shar@@ p@@ able effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; Zoom Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image along the star @-@ shaped lines that origin@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sport photography . &quot;
radi@@ al shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image by turning the pixels at a center point . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
removing bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to appear in the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
intelligent shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make drops of rain on your picture . it gives natural your images a wet look . it uses a protected algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . as the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
&quot; you can keep an area free from rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , for example a face that should remain free to choose . if you then start the Filter Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent Filter Filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo is wrong orientation , you can put it through mirrors or rotate in the right direction . &quot;
bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the large question is , how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zo@@ oming into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find the missing information ? &quot;
&quot; if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size changes in the menu and enter the target values . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size changes uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bub@@ bles was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ IM@@ G project . &quot;
&quot; you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider new size , and are listed below : &quot;
maintaining aspect ratio : if this setting is activated is retained when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is retained .
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . &quot;
&quot; the buttons store as and loading are used exactly in this way . larger image can be saved as text file , and later re@@ loaded . &quot;
&quot; bub@@ bles are very fast at what makes it , but it can take very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement .
&quot; to cut a photo is not only a frequently conducted operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to make a picture . &quot;
&quot; if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after the crop . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the recording , use the button &quot; &quot; The Edge button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimmed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format , the higher value of the height and width of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are inches , inches or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ers and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to c@@ entering the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the max . button the area for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio allows its settings depending on orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the mapping tool the next time , these settings will be stored as standard values depending on orientation . &quot;
&quot; the settings of mer@@ ging help allow help to include help , so that you can put your images better together . these aids are : &quot;
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden center : the golden center is a division based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ ti@@ lus shell or the leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the Ir@@ rational Number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you &apos;ve already used the ancient Egyp@@ tians and Greeks to construct your tem@@ ples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden center offers more liquid aid lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden spiral will bring you to your goal good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ layer gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; a further rule are the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye is in the centre of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equ@@ ino@@ gen tri@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect of professional photographers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focus on one of the editing points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve otherwise . &quot;
the options Horizont@@ al mirr@@ ored and mirr@@ ored can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious parts .
&quot; with the color of the button , you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
&quot; if you do a photo , it &apos;s easy that you don &apos;t see the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . &quot;
turn your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . you can reset the slider again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right .
&quot; for your help , the module allows a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cur@@ sor to position the two lines . once you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have shot an image , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to use the function transformation cutting out of the image . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . however , note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ istic trans@@ formations are performed at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is depicted in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little dirty . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid it if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with transformation cutting out of the image . &quot;
&quot; this is not a rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; create your image by using the horizontal angles and vertical angles . you can switch horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press on default settings , the angle is set to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed right from the preview area . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ uff@@ le , the image will be a bit bl@@ urred . for a single inser@@ tion this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two layers generate twice as much wi@@ per and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in corners . one way to remove it is to cut the image with transformation cutting out of the image . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always be JPEG and TIFF . &quot;
&quot; if the extension is listed in the list , then &amp; digi@@ kam , you can see this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can find further information in the configuration section . &quot;
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG and TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour , you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; the table below shows a brief list of raw formats that von &amp; digi@@ kam are supported . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats that von &amp; digi@@ kam are supported , supported : &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam , it doesn &apos;t have any built @-@ in capability to display or edit movies . &quot;
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .

&quot; the met@@ adata bank is over@@ written from the data of the files , and the other variant can be started from the menu album . &quot;
&quot; all configured cameras are listed here . you can add the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please , look in the camera for further information . &quot;
ki@@ pi module exports a number of images into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed at Google Earth .
&quot; if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast is very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the module white balance . &quot;
many tools you need for photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; its description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools , such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , plas@@ tici@@ zers , noise reduction , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp masks , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type , which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture application &quot; ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image .
vertical parts without duplic@@ ate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without duplic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
vertical divide . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper area shows the original and the lower the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse inside the picture , and place on the part of the image you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all adjustments of the last use of the module will be noticed .
the side bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from EX@@ IF data if they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble miniature program . you can click in or zo@@ oming out and move it . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and selecting colors .
&quot; the pal@@ let files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be considered either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and last use colours . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets , or browse the folder to files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as line in the pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described under the pal@@ let view . here , the color name can be changed . &quot;
&quot; in order to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to move . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing was selected . this mode , you can set this mode by selecting the check box under the cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; and k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional colour name followed by a line sign if another color follows . if so , three numbers are in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
&quot; a color somewhere on the screen , and then find them in the color selection on the left . &quot;

additional software : &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program which pre@@ suppos@@ es the graph ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs .
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially when you start &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only opens the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is bigger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview , or choose this position automatically with the context menu . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just been changed by another program , the following window will be shown : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ loaded , or whether you want to ignore the change . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; select an instance , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the gra@@ dients in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the start of the program , you can open all the graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both back and later . &quot;
&quot; you can also set the graph to be divided on several pages , and the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you are using several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page preview with a graph parti@@ tioned on several pages , without header , and with a different font &quot;
&quot; the re@@ loading page gives the opportunity to determine the behavior if a file has been modified on the disk , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the opening gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window , or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) , or determine that every time you are asked . &quot;
&quot; you can set a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or determine , at any start , be asked . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , usually with one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; appears , opens more options : &quot;
here you can choose between different &amp; gra@@ vi@@ z layout algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edges as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces images according to the spr@@ ing@@ time model . in this process , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; -@@ algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ in model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene . &quot;

&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . in order to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file . of course , this file contains data the same time recorded at the same locations as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation which coordinates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time , so the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
&quot; the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation indicates a higher devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data will be merged . the maximum value is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have track data from a place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ation is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog displays the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the map can also be selected with the displayed map . select the region , and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Add this repeatedly through until you have reached far reaching accuracy . the map can be changed manually between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside of the ki@@ pi module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool uses to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4@@ .01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is coded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; with the three buttons on the right @-@ hand side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the album preview and the text that will appear in the head of the HTML page will appear . &quot;
&quot; if you then click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed . &quot;
&quot; a sub @-@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ X@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth , of course also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the generation . &quot;
the ki@@ pi image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the ti@@ pi viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rot@@ ations , zo@@ oms , or displac@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the ki@@ pi JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
click &apos; Insert Before &apos; button and &apos; Publish button &apos; .
the ki@@ pi Modul digital camera client is a tool that lets you connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the ki@@ pi Modul digital camera client is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the ki@@ pi teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the ki@@ pi @-@ team . &quot;
&quot; with the Import function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
JPEG is supported when writing . please check ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the ki@@ pi MPEG coder module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshows . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can select the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium . &quot;
&quot; you must first select the images that should be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can create the module via Extras MPEG @-@ Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
the images selected are then listed below image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and path of the created file can be set under name of the MPEG output file . keep as if as possible the extension mp@@ g . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all your settings , you can now go to the film . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go to a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the button settings to the right . &quot;
&quot; the print as@@ sistent allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard phot@@ og@@ gles . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gim@@ p image processing . this is , for example , useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module . &quot;
&quot; with this ki@@ pi module , you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats , JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quot@@ ation from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results !
&quot; first , select the RAW file you want to convert and start the module . the Raw Image Converter window appears in the mode for a single image . &quot;
&quot; the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture afterwards . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG Conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera is in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch doesn &apos;t have any effect . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . &quot;
&quot; the best image format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
click Start ! and your NEF photos will soon be modified . 포@@ 맷 NEF 회@@ 사 Nikon
&quot; JPEG 2000 is a wav@@ el@@ et @-@ based image compression standard . if you want to use JPEG as a file , you will need Adobe Flash Player 9 , or greater , installed on your computer . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion button with the trigger button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images to once . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful if it has been created in an earlier attempt . however , preview is not available . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ in . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ in . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; press preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo print . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , marginal size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this ki@@ pi module , you can send selected pictures with your favorite email program . &quot;
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed by you . add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be shown on the right @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; you can also add images to the picture list , and place them in order to add the list of images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; with the button images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all the pictures , you can open the New Message window to your e @-@ mail client with the button . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected are included as app@@ endix . &quot;
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send emails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the GM@@ ail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments on the images are put together into a text file and attached the mail . &quot;
&quot; PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . therefore , you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
JPEG 2000 is a wav@@ el@@ et format based on the TIFF / EP format and mand@@ ates use of met@@ adata .
&quot; if the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically launched at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module &apos;s advanced slide show , a window with questions like you want to show your slide show will appear . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ transitions option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option indicates that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the left corner during the presentation .
&quot; the loop will allow the presentation to be displayed in a final loop . afterwards , you can cancel it manually with Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; the images random@@ ly select the images displayed in a random order , so it is not used the order of the images in the album . &quot;
&quot; the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and your chosen transition effect . so you should check this before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . acci@@ dentally cho@@ oses between the images a different effect .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar on the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in writing this , please contact the ki@@ pi teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the option of the sub @-@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse through this browser , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , you are now in any group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have posted your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current preview images . &quot;
&quot; if you press with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images displayed on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of displayed images from a few thousand pictures to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view preview images to view the pictures of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . &quot;
&quot; in order to show pictures beside the names , select the button , which is located on the right outside of the tool@@ bar . in this context menu , you can select the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately . &quot;
&quot; in order to do this you will have to select the image for each individual person . to do this , you will need to select the image for the appropriate person . now you can select the image for the appropriate person . you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the window , you can select the image for the appropriate person . &quot;
&quot; if you call this entry in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . &quot;
&quot; the date can be either part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use an area of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all images by specific names as you can see in the picture . here , you will see images where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like reading manu@@ als , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline .
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline allows you to interact with the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , you will see the first image of this date in preview ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the caption and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why they are not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; below on the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have set . so , you can browse your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture bigger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; for all your HTML files , select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to choose either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these really are visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created . the URL that you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings that are currently described are all three on basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in this , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name can be set to the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create your pictures with these . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog is described for export@@ ing images that you can export to the File Export menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
&quot; in the manual to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the Automati@@ cally close to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically apply for you . &quot;
&quot; since most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do this , simply select the Export File option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you may not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image is at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File import ... select , will &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the Wiz@@ ard to import is made up of four steps . first , you have to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you can person@@ alize the category people of the import@@ ing file ( if you are a Dan@@ ger ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window to import which categories of the import@@ ing file should be imported and which categories will meet them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compens@@ ate the categories of the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be simple to browse pictures and look at : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will pass the various steps from ( 1 ) specify the information about your images , through ( 2 ) to browse and view , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program for managing your images . however , it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x.@@ xml file in the top folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can save with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which can be accessed through a button to the F1 button and click on the option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set your own groups such as items , animals or albums for each image . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub @-@ categories were already mentioned . in dialogue options , you can set up whole membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a moder@@ ator as explained . &quot;
&quot; in the left window of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called ki@@ pi and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a Help page , which you can view over the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used together with each other together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should test new modules first with the demo database before using the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or using the Help menu . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via ki@@ pi are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use ki@@ pi is that the other applications do not support their images in albums : there is an album just a folder . even when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order doesn &apos;t support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums . for example , if you use the category people , you will do so , so if you would have chosen people to view it and add this to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people who see on the picture , where the picture was taken . &quot;
&quot; all these notes may be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text field by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use it again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family party and on all 50 pictures depic@@ ting the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , by means that the names used are moved upwards , find the people faster and as@@ sign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have any comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located below the preview of the image to the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item of multiple entries to once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the note dialog@@ s , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new revision or sub@@ category . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the note dialog@@ s by clicking the list , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window from a frame by pulling it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... that allows you to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window later , use the options ... and click here to hide / hide . this process is shown in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry of images in the browser , you will receive an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you have no filter . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images from which you want to delete and press the Edit Select menu . now , you will see the window you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the disk . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right top edge is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if so , you don &apos;t have to ask for the installation of the respective CD . so if you want to avoid trouble such as the mess of your images , you can buy a bigger hard drive to store all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . &quot;
&quot; so you have set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the F@@ allen . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry , which allows all images you have locked out . if you want to see the pictures again , click Lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is not very safe . for one , all images on the hard disk and the other can easily read or delete the password as un@@ encryp@@ ted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you all have all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours of hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , you have a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in the picture . of course , it shows the picture , but additional information you have about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and lay somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see , find suitable entries to this . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down . they can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as a slide show . &quot;
&quot; a very useful ability of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and return . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the viewer , you can get in the picture and zo@@ oming . you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not drawn zo@@ omed . with the resolution button sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel is equivalent to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work with videos will work in and out with the plus and minus keys .
&quot; with the functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu point ann@@ otation from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog to enter this name . however , you will probably prefer to select the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with pictures and select them as good or bad while you watch one after another . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the ability to provide pictures with features while you view them . features include the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in view , you can see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have added features to your images , these are available in your browser . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in dre preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the characters for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the mixture does not store with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to finish the painting from the context menu , select on the picture from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire modes views are shown yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects have already been selected by the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have modified properties , click on users to take these changes . if you have invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then , you can correct the input error and click on application or disc@@ lose the changes . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; if you want only one part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local . &quot;
the screen shot shows the camera control points . you can drag them with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window .
&quot; each object has a visibility stage as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected , or their visibility stage smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the tool@@ bar &apos;s tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window configuration as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown to the left , and the four graphical views on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window configuration , or if you need another order , you can set them as desired . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
&quot; to create a new column , go to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to as@@ sign several views to one another , go to the beginning of a different view . you can then switch between the views of clicking on the card map above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to resolve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the Anf@@ al to the desktop or click on the small arrow in the header bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can save you with view window configuration , and a dialog is displayed in which you can store the window configuration under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dern them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ew the current scene , click on the icon rendering the icon rendering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of the rendering . if you want to ren@@ ew a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can paste as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full @-@ size images . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog is opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to recognize the features of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ ew only a small area of the image , select the section of the section and enter the picture section for rendering in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination with quality , you can select the properties , which &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this is a very simple colour and light model to model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual . &quot;
&quot; these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . in general , images with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; and Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling the adjacent pixel is adap@@ tively . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is continuously fragmented and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam of pixels . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels is exceeded , both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a lat@@ tice of 4x4 additional points will be calculated with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
Di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixels are divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which can be tra@@ cked individually and checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth of depth . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch to J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this card map , you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; select the menu entry , select the menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; yet not the complete command sum of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; in order to import objects into the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor , you can paste source for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also add the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type characteristics .
&quot; you can set the object of the dots onto the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model views . here , you can set the grid for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended proj@@ ections , all wire models will be further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . &quot;
&quot; when you display a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you show ground , a floor underneath the objects will be rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you check the edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold values can be adjusted . more exact information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can modify existing window orders or create new window instructions . in the section window instructions , you will explain how to create and store window orders . &quot;
the combination of standard window regulations : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of existing window instructions shows all existing window instructions . a new arrangement allows you to create adding button , and delete a selected arrangement with the button . &quot;
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
&quot; the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window configuration . new views can be created using the button , and delete selected views with the button . &quot;
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ts anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with in@@ serts anchor the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start with no more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners : a sphere on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider following warnings carefully before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , you can &apos;t use rules for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you will only receive a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following window regulations : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; in order to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Delete button . so you now have a scene without any objects . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the racing scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see for more details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later guidance , but note that the camera has control points that you can change the camera &apos;s target point . just click on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button , or press En@@ ter , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a qu@@ ader ( insert final body fa@@ der ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ comprehen@@ sible method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the button and press En@@ ter . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane expands up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; just select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a lot of different materials at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog appears in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first sub@@ property . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree . you can preview the name in the property view ( name = floor @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the thumbnail preview you see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment is just a matt black material , because you can still have settings for the pig@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and Ball , just click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you want to ren@@ ew your image with one click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you have to type two new attributes . in the color list you have to type two new attributes , called Solid Color . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select one color and change colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should already be able to run this step , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you have already understood . the ball can be just as simple as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press En@@ ter or button ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise the ball would float above the ground , as you have moved the floor to a unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering is now a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put a suitable material in the next step . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can as@@ sign it now . as already on the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as a color : &quot;
&quot; select first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in the Pig@@ ment sphere . click on the Pig@@ ment sphere , then select one color and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish features :
&quot; then change the values like in the following screen shots , and click En@@ ter or press En@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the settings shine effect and reflection already produce good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities are you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple , but nice scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender Method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ting , the Ren@@ derer hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that hin@@ ders scenes ) by each pixel . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects like fog will affect the scene . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixel . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be changed , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
&quot; open a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you &apos;ve created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you haven &apos;t saved any saved changes in the scene .
&quot; repeat the most recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected , if you have used editing undo . &quot;
&quot; save the current window configuration and open a dialog , in which you enter a name for a new layout or over@@ write an existing order . &quot;
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the keys and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can add pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to make rough surfaces without changing any hi@@ ves on the surface without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then be mach@@ ined to give them a more realistic look . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color to pixel base , using an image file as a color map . &quot;

images can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or button return .
&quot; you can set , if each image is to be displayed in one &apos;s own window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a suitable file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue setting up - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and Mach@@ ining and Dias@@ how , you can set the way of working &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display and short instructions for the browser , the keys can be set for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can continue down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still see the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option save &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when loading the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the color bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of screen in full screen mode . if window mode is bigger than the image , the background is filled with the selected colour . &quot;
&quot; you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged on the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; to change the value , enter a new value into the input field , or use the slider to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is ab@@ orted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field , or use the slider to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the keys for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display and short instructions for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ sided view of the file system with folders and files in one window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the brief description .

&quot; it is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto , then we would like to ask you to join the user mailing list from &amp; show@@ foto . &quot;
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ foto ; .
the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color shown when the sub@@ - or over @-@ exposure indicator was selected . sk@@ ill@@ ful colors should display the colors with what you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and exposure to a dark colour . &quot;
&quot; the main window from &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side bar on the right edge , which provides you important information and actions on the selected pictures . you can also view the same page strip in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this page : http : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; channel ; with the command c@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can &apos;t be opened or if no standard sc@@ anners are specified , a dialog will open to the scanner selection . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; channel ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; channel lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ an ) these options are not particularly treated .
&quot; in order to get a picture , the user can only start a preliminary scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zo@@ oming into the picture and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the picture will appear in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image is saved and sh@@ lie ? en leads to a break and you get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; due to the button settings , the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before save preview will be selected . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them the way to save images . dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog in front of each image sc@@ anned picture . if &amp; channel lite ; this will automatically save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to select it without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; the default value is your home directory , and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically saved images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved picture gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if Cho@@ ose image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help ki@@ cks off the K@@ DE help with the &amp; channel ; -@@ manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; channel lite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; channel lite ;

&quot; you may set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; therefore , make your keyboard to the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control centre . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok &apos;s D@@ CO@@ P interface has many general functions , mostly in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script is not executed because of a lack of dependency . please check in your script if all required modules are available , and use a dialogue so that the user knows why a script is not running . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of text scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts , or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts are relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command D@@ CO@@ P ; , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way , D@@ CO@@ P &gt; can be called relatively simple . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; send noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the folder on the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is played . the script could be now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signal a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ is@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ulation - Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be used . to remove the menu an own entry you can use D@@ CO@@ P am@@ aro@@ k script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ulation ) .
&quot; before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , saving data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script pack@@ ets , which the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . these packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 , only script packages will accept amar@@ .@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages properly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining loaded modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the -@@ p t@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is finished , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the Wiki script page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts . &quot;
&quot; * Just a quick thank you for the software though , It &apos;s not often you get a free software version of this quality and style ! well done and please continue this amazing gallery . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you can simply drag music into the play@@ list instead of working through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title from thousands of thousands of your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &quot; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you have already some play@@ lists , but can never decide what you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is just right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to comp@@ ile and install amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , if you encounter problems , please report this in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options you can activate or disable the configure script at the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . for details , see the System Requirements section . &quot;
&quot; enabled de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full . &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with no effort to set up the setup dialog , the setup dialog has several cards to set up the different functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the player window will display the player window in addition to play@@ list . if the option is disabled , only the play@@ list window will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this function is only available when &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the option switches the experimental function of the voting bar@@ omet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; design : this function is only available when &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , this will change the colour scheme for the mood barometer . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored in the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
External browsers : lets you choose which browser of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k should be started when a browser is required .
&quot; in other browsers , you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; save play@@ list when saving , save the current play@@ list automatically when you exit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; . activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the play@@ list , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is saved . &quot;
&quot; in order to keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces when changing the piece , the play@@ list window opens / off to keep the unit always visible in the visible window . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context browser , the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the App@@ ear@@ ance , you can custom@@ ize &amp; am@@ aro@@ k &apos;s appearance . the section is part of three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section you can select the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can select fon@@ ts for the following range : play@@ list window , player window and context browser . click on the window , so you can select a type of fon@@ ts from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color selection for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; after the start of the program , play@@ back automatically starts with the piece at the point where it was stopped during the last stop . &quot;
&quot; if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . click on selecting the font to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check@@ box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ at@@ ched in the O@@ SD . &quot;
&quot; one click on the color areas opens the color selection dialog box . if your own colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set and k@@ de colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the input field display text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can set the screen of a multi @-@ screen environment that O@@ SD should appear . &quot;
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the sel@@ ector box . some drivers activate additional settings in this card card .
the card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . to include a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
search for sub@@ folders : this causes that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
&quot; monitor changes : enables &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; import play@@ lists : causes that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection , then appear later in the play@@ list browser . &quot;
&quot; the collection database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device is used for setting up the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; it is used on the computer , where the my@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , it is entered under Port : the network port where the database is reached . name : is the database name for which the connection is made . &quot;
use username : password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
&quot; the last@@ .@@ fm list targets the support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ fm server , and create music recommendations for the current piece . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
send the played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ fm profile .
note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ fm profile to use this function .
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE pack@@ ets . you have to install k@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs contained therein , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them to find modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , for example . we try to support am@@ aro@@ k on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can locate the file by typ@@ ing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
mostly it is because Tag@@ lib is crashing when reading the meta @-@ information from this file system crashing . please report this error to the tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is somewhat more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , this leads to crashes when editing the Meta information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then disable Autom@@ . shut@@ down , when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the meta @-@ info , but these are not known as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error when writing tags from $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : m@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ U -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
this is a well known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 .
&quot; if you get this error : cat@@ amar@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ an app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ o app &quot; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ fying Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf that am@@ aro@@ K first finds the right version first . &quot;
&quot; there are some ways . most of the installation problems are most easily resolved through the help of an expert , your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and the IRC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
&quot; Bug@@ zilla is not suitable for searching for help . please enter only a bug , if you have something to fix a bug in am@@ aro@@ k itself . &quot;
&quot; after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , only an empty play@@ list appears . how do music pieces come in ? &quot;
this is simple . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
&quot; to intui@@ tively keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start window has been transformed into the statistic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for judging by the user , while the points are calculated automatically . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate the pieces , the review column must be displayed in the play@@ list . click anywhere in the new application column to set the review for a piece . you can also set the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press it on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would do with other files . so simple is that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of play@@ list , right next to the add button , you can save the play@@ list button . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ mms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . see also lib@@ Visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer ...
&quot; no . yes , that &apos;s true ! don &apos;t ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is what media types supported G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we can de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to indicate another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; this does &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; already . don &apos;t forget that media will have to be de@@ coded first . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . g@@ asp@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ code the data first . the stream amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . activate Sound@@ server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ MO co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed play@@ back . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can ask the IRC channel # g@@ asp@@ able .
&quot; try this ( quit am@@ aro@@ k before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then merge in the module folder from G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / g@@ stream @-@ config ) , and run list register again . start now &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
&quot; if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm execute this command : D@@ CO@@ P am@@ aro@@ k player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets you start playing . make sure that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you wake up from the gentle tones of music that you have stopped before bed@@ time . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; ongoing titles when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you an interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : s@@ sh -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP D@@ CO@@ P --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ playing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k window ; press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size of modi@@ fiable windows . &quot;
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the queu@@ e sequence in the queu@@ e . by pressing the input button after searching in the play@@ list the first search will be played and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and play@@ list have tricky functions , but how does it look like the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; in the context menu , you can select which browser should be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my personal folder $ HOME is on a NFS drive . after the start of am@@ aro@@ k , the collection database cannot be created , and on the console many error messages appear . what now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ back , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , select FROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE url = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( url ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this is the previous rating with a decreasing value , based on how often the play was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has to the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the review for a piece yourself by clicking on a column header in the play@@ list window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely , by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and click Edit : select rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the Met@@ adata dialog . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want to announce when you want to publish a stable version of am@@ aro@@ k . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release schedule , not with the short @-@ term plan of am@@ aro@@ K . &quot;
&quot; this is a new function in am@@ aro@@ k , which some users can find annoying . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar .
&quot; download a design , or create a own . install this then under am@@ aro@@ k ... App@@ ear@@ ance context browser design , click New Design ... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to browse and control &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; while you browse in the kon@@ quer@@ or . start the kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select &quot; &quot; Add am@@ aro@@ k &quot; &quot; in the drop down menu . &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio @-@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; supported .
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; probably &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ asp@@ able . therefore , the / configure routine does not comp@@ ile these output modules . you have to recon@@ figure and install these output modules . &quot;
&quot; now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; newly installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;

&quot; the play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left @-@ hand side is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of play@@ list , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you may notice that the window starts off . the information presented there are now divided into other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . furthermore , information can be viewed in the statistical window ( ex@@ tras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the straight piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below , you can see the cover picture of the album and beside it a Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to match the piece in the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
&quot; under the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol , you will find more information about the current piece . see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its evaluation . &quot;
&quot; in order to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images in the same folder must be in the same folder as the current piece . the images may have any names , but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the suggested pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this area shows the five most valued pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .

you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on the right mouse button and then choose one of the possibilities to add the piece or album to the play@@ list .
&quot; in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded lyrics will be displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . if no text script runs , you can choose which is to be started . &quot;
&quot; the Edit menu allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database , and no running text script is required . &quot;
button Search opens a search to google.com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ ters - group@@ ed only the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list below various performers . &quot;
&quot; if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;

&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can custom@@ ize and combine group@@ ing entirely . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically capture your collection once you have something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the construction supervision . note for use of this filter can be found in the section to play@@ list in this manual . &quot;

&quot; the play@@ list browser establish@@ es the handling of many play@@ lists quite simple . among other things , he also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ list browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection that has never been played yet .
&quot; even created Intelli@@ gent play@@ lists are possible . click &quot; &quot; Intelli@@ gent play@@ list &quot; &quot; to open the dialog to create a new Intelli@@ gent Play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; the Media @-@ Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpre@@ te in the upper list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer items to your iPod , drag the desired title from the play@@ list and let them fall on the list of interpre@@ ters . if you &apos;re done , click &quot; App@@ ly . &quot; this allows the pieces to be uploaded to your iPod . when the transfer is complete , quit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; and dis@@ solve the drive connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files will be hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can go to music in the musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , the attachments of files can be tricky by simple drop @-@ down . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this allows the holding of the Shift key to be added automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ list contains all the pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply adding the entries with the mouse to the desired place . once you enter letters , you will only see the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the button until the text field is empty . &quot;
&quot; if you type separate search terms by spaces , you will search for entries containing all search terms . for instance , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example , one OR two OR three . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , which contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;d like to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also look for larger or smaller . for example , rating : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that are not included . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syntax @-@ variations by choice . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 @-@ comment : bad . this is looking for all pieces , which contain either Mike Old@@ field or a higher rating than 50 , not included in the comment . &quot;
&quot; you can set the sequence sequence of entries by holding the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click the right mouse button in the desired order . the entries then receive a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are returned . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of play@@ list . on the left hand you will find the button Add , which you can add to the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow reverse and restore . so you can undo or restore changes to the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; in the center of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , enlarged analysis . the refre@@ sher rate can be adjusted with a click of right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that , which you get in the player window over the right mouse button . &quot;
&quot; there are many more available buttons for tool@@ bars , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume control . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on play@@ list . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play@@ time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar , and disable the status bar in general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu will reach you by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the play@@ list menu . &quot;
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k .

&quot; the content view allows selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow area that only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to modify the key assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the button assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs will be set . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot;
&quot; open the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on an@@ hi@@ ve . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the D@@ CO@@ P command line program or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function range , so it is rather your taste and the way of your task is crucial , which of the enclosed programs you give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the D@@ CO@@ P command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following to the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the default D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which applies only to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ live ; is an audio CD ; select for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ live ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) , and from many en@@ coding to en@@ code these WAV files ( loss@@ less compression ) . more co@@ thi@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format , or in other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ prior to ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ thi@@ ers must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a little introduction on Ko@@ di@@ erer , Audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ live ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read audio data from the &amp; CD ; . this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog is often called up until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily use of reading one &amp; CD will be explained . this results ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet , or can work entirely without a network , with everything that is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is only a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step , for example , there are more information about how this program is used , as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB query of the CD data according to the set of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be made . ) &quot;
starts reading and - when an en@@ coder is configured in the setup directory in the setup directory - the en@@ coding .
&quot; open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the default . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already used file is selected to en@@ code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code . &quot;
&quot; open the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; open the main alignment dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ q ; with different card cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ coder ) . hi@@ eh@@ in must go before the program can successfully be used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ thi@@ ers and compression rates and helps you choose the right coding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; Sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both co@@ thi@@ ers produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is provided free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly lower bit@@ rates compared to O@@ GG . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ equipment is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . &quot;
a short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people , and most of the music &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stere@@ o@@ ys . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , which is manually entered or downloaded from fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the en@@ coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the en@@ coding experts explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ fix must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ chat ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can download / enter the information , so that all other information can be downloaded instead of themselves into the computer . it is to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( with the translator : that &apos;s the author ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from entering from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only be the programm@@ ers who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ live ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , ge@@ ographi@@ cally will be used to the next @-@ lying mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides an up @-@ to @-@ date list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( normally produced monthly ) only updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to save songs from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see To note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution first , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; for the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab page . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the Linux distribution , before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined co@@ thi@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a coding , further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and re@@ a@@ dership of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step for step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood all , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame may be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . in any case , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the account ) .
&quot; the first section treats the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ chat , something which is probably done only once and &quot;
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for any ending &amp; CD .
here we determine the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any reading of a &amp; CD ; if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; read data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card menu General settings . here you can &apos;t do much here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen shot . &quot;
&quot; only If you request incomplete information , so that you will be noti@@ fied when data for generating keyword words ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the map CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and can download the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected during reading the &amp; CD ; with the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the associated directory names / file names or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory / file name is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode when you download the database before . however , these two selection fields must be selected , at least the first one . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first one . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server on the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally as far as the server is concerned , since many fire@@ walls are bo@@ iling the protocol 88@@ 80 , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
&quot; in addition Michel is speaker , blogger and author of several books . read more ... ( 470 words , 1 image , estimated 1 : 53 mins reading time ) &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading out of the last piece , check this to cast off the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you check this , then / must specify the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . this can be useful if there is only place on another drive . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , something must be left after the right , to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting bit rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ cting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted if necessary . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of subsequent change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of WAV files simultaneously : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , try to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ live ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD is running ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each broadcasting &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; use which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different than those for one &amp; CD ; with success by fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data , rather than pick them out of the internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , then the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , look in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album is displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry in your opinion best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger it manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but pick up the data from the Internet , you will need to connect to the internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; curr@@ ent@@ titel &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comments section can be used for each individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v1 tags . this limit the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comments section . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least at what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ chat ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor at any time . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re @-@ create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; Tags are not supported by all en@@ coding or file formats , in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information . &quot;
&quot; simply select an entry that is obviously consistent with the style of the selected CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the CD editor &apos;s window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece is definitely and other information you want . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . just the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection of the reading process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; on the rider &apos;s orders , click on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly underneath the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you try to work with a co@@ di@@ erer you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been en@@ coded successfully are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the MP3 format . thus , read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is en@@ coded in the queu@@ e of the code . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ chat , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need your choice . &quot;
&quot; most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ live ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably already did it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons who comp@@ ile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you search for help like the program can be adapted to your needs when running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step for step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different card maps of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still read ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any indication of how to proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program start doesn &apos;t have any audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an unusual short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this has probably started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; strange when you have managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support work . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultra @-@ sound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA will be included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of any MIDI channel activity by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to mid .
&quot; supports the two existing standards , in order to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ ital events or text events ) . &quot;
&quot; if you exit &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Ab@@ use in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play from the menu or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces they are added to a collection and then played after each other . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump at any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or slowly , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tem@@ po@@ ad , and change the speed . to get the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
controls : this game is played with mouse only .
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events should be presented and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song so you don &apos;t have to set anything manually . however , if you want to edit automatic text selection in the Settings menu , you will automatically select the kar@@ ao@@ ke text . however , you still have the possibility to change it if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the entries text events or rec@@ ital events from the menu . the same function also includes the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summari@@ ze . these are played by the series . in this section you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection below the point of organization .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
&quot; you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying , and then specify the name for the new collection . &quot;
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the winn@@ ings in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs that you want to add to any other collection can be added . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will be automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when Automati@@ cally add to the collection , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the added pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the set after the menu sequence of the menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump up a song , select the Next Song button , the next song from the menu or press the arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the previous piece , the previous piece from the menu or press the arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the Delete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map acts General MIDI events in events that synthes@@ izer synthes@@ iz@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ WE and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI Maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all necessary changes to play a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section that may appear as often as desired . &quot;
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of KE@@ Y@@ MAP ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TIONS ... EN@@ D
see that DE@@ F@@ INE is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
&quot; in this section , you specify how the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use is as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the sign character is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you cannot change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; if so , if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( gun@@ shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that the term &quot; &quot; Tro@@ mmel patch &quot; &quot; is meant here , where each tone is another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone is the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as its presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names only in the first line .
&quot; key@@ maps are used above all to form sounds on the percussion channel . see , for example , the included key@@ maps . &quot;
&quot; this section may be used to replic@@ ate some channels on others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply make the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the KE@@ Y@@ MAP option , the KE@@ Y@@ MAP must naturally be defined in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored if you want to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch b@@ illing event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only rela@@ yed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that the map file does not have dec@@ im@@ al com@@ mas . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM anticip@@ ates that a keyboard that will play a pitch bit@@ ing event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards are trying to play two tones up to a oc@@ ta@@ ve higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard sounds , see which sounds are played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t illumin@@ ate green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to view the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the channel view : settings
&quot; the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text you can slow down it . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , etc ; so that the same MIDI file can perform very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support it has been compiled . to eliminate the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution system ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s Home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; OK , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
&quot; you can use the arrow keys left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down play@@ back . to restore the standard tempo , you can double click on the LCD . &quot;
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ desktop with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) or hang ( if I want to play a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) .
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the setting Automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ M. , B.@@ A. and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then you decide to play B.@@ A. and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;

&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ ao@@ ke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you would like to send me a postcard or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ ao@@ ke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll get in touch with my friends ( if you want to ) . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , and nobody gets money from anyone . I therefore want to stress that I only get further programs because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the error that the pitch at A@@ WE charts was too high .
&quot; my thanks also is Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ aci@@ o Gar@@ cia for testing the A@@ WE support , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magnus pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error notification or even a supp@@ or@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net , giving us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on its homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ ao@@ ke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM radio or an A@@ WE card . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need &amp; k@@ mid ; comp@@ ile with the parameters MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; c@@ app@@ name ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE Website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category &quot; &quot; Perman@@ ently Play@@ list &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ archy . if you want an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and play@@ back starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ list can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that when &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu items must be selected with play@@ list and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost , when the processing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation in the boot and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ serving option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ xml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ xml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; animation at boot doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be disturbing at the end animation , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the view of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ ey ; &amp; lt ; body ; &amp; lt ; img = &quot; &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / mum@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; meet &quot; &quot; ; are in the directory test / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L the by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; are supported . &quot;
&quot; there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; . here , the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the buffer size of the data stream from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c , such as setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ zilla module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even insert the special field video for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is used in a con@@ soles application and to search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ph@@ on@@ on must restore all og@@ g files by manual change of file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . &quot;
&quot; before TV can be looked , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port should be detected ( e.g. PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ linux extension must be functional to the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources used different names . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , p@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ source , url@@ .html , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ bul@@ letin . if they are enabled , they start with the play@@ list . &quot;
are there any hints about how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely sure to place / dev / c@@ drom to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine starts slowly , why does my CPU have to be tested on their performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically takes the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

&quot; the introduction includes at least the \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the \ \ begin { document } , and must be closed again with the \ \ end { document } command . &quot;
the Quick Start Assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the wizard provides some possibilities for creating the document .
&quot; document classes : her@@ eby the nature of the document contains : article ( article ) , Book &#91; book &#93; , Letter &#91; Report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , Films &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot;
&quot; coding : her@@ eby the character en@@ coding is set . modern systems use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 en@@ coding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be washed ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) . &quot;
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration it needs to be selected only in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t want to worry . it is only a short description of the functions and further information on this site .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - same as other source editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of a new command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) , this function can be disabled in the menu . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allow the document to be divided into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph , the lowest element ) : &quot;
&quot; if you think this is a server error , please contact the webmaster . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex , it can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex . once a DVI @-@ file &#91; ger@@ Ã ¼ ts@@ .@@ D e v ice I n@@ ought file ) &#93; was created , navig@@ ates &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI @-@ file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and other information such as font , and is beside PDF the common output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and to print DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor and as soon as it has been cli@@ cked to an element in the DVI ; -@@ file is the exact opposite of it . as soon as you cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , you will jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files .
quick build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool bar , the three large selection fields should be stri@@ pped . the selection fields were developed for quick introduction of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick links of the document in parts , chapters , sections ... &quot;
&quot; the selection box More is for entries of articles such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex .
&quot; the last selection box with the name of the font is used for determining the font sizes . however , the font sizes can be specified for the main text , the notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; when you call &amp; k@@ ile , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font size . if the font sizes are not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the above source code is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex must be compiled ; the simpl@@ est way to do this is the use of Men@@ Ã ¼ s Build or Kn@@ op@@ ter Quick Installation . &quot;
&quot; the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ iler . &amp; k@@ ile , automatically trig@@ gers the storage . &quot;
&quot; if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( environment ) is a text that will be treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font sizes 12 will be created , and only a few lines should have another font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment } , \ \ identification { environment }

&quot; there are many possibilities for the read@@ ability and user @-@ friend@@ liness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold print , cur@@ sive printing , sub@@ missions , etc . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be shown in a set with \ \ pl@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex , now a step @-@ by @-@ step guide will follow the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wizard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments should be executed for the better read@@ ability of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been reviewed , editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( at the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI @-@ file was created , the document can print or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed using printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar is possible to convert the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI @-@ file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; in order to select the pre @-@ select interface , the mouse cur@@ sor must be placed in a line of the source text and will be cli@@ cked on pre @-@ registration . the jump in the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is then taken . &quot;
&quot; with this function in &amp; ok@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document of &amp; k@@ ile ; required and for the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; k@@ ile ; as text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor ) &quot;
&quot; should an error be available when using Quick Installation of the &amp; DVI ; it may be an error . if a bug is available , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the file contains the source code in the source code . in the editor you can click on the previous La@@ TeX error and ne@@ sted La@@ TeX errors for Spr@@ ints , in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , you must click on the error in logging and k@@ ile ; navig@@ ates to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once you cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template for the document . the pre @-@ set possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; if you choose a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written or the wizard will be used to create a new document . further information can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be opened or created a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by creating an existing document and selection of file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template through file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character en@@ coding ) . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the following commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default size . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . if a simple way to create a template , it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;

&quot; the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . though , there are already excellent possibilities for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are always many environments and groups and therefore supported &amp; k@@ ile ; special commands for their selection . &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning refers to tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source text . the only beu@@ tiful thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the blocks are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a return stroke ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;

it has been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; k@@ ile ; for further commands in the editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will start at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will start at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command for closing the surrounding area .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is present or within the \ \ begin { environment } , you will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many sleep@@ y ambient commands , the property can quickly be lost . this command acts as the most recently constructed environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by brackets { ... } . &quot;
this command will start at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded clip .
&quot; with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is in front or behind the cur@@ ly clas@@ p of a &amp; tex ; group # , it will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the input of many welded @-@ pointed braces , the property can quickly be lost . this command replaces the last modified group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;

&quot; if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not only a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a sp@@ read@@ sheet environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ with an ad@@ joining line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . these can be put under Settings k@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ TeX can be added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables , and all em@@ t characters ( amp ; ) arrange each other . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; quot ; already has a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; k@@ ile ; there are three different modes of operation . three of them work according to need and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation ... &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } becomes &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and incor@@ rectly sets the completion list . on the other hand , the list can also reduce the list by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . as an alternative , they can be used by selecting a command . alternatively , they can be entered by typ@@ ing marks , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible and the desired parameters can be entered . &quot;
&quot; under Settings k@@ ile , set ... k@@ ile ; Sent@@ enced settings can be made to these lists . you can choose different lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as proof of general language use . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not possible for completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin , and the call of completion mode will have a very large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; after that , the command to open the environment is automatically entered and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environmental damage can be continued in the simpl@@ est way , and push the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is completed , the environment will automatically shut down . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings k@@ ile ; set ... k@@ ile ; Sent@@ enced settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of attachment mode for &amp; tex , - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;

&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even perhaps little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we begin editing the Edit Pan@@ e menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog is enabled to manage and add all the contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI element in it :

&quot; often work on a project for several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members , and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identi@@ fiers .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can look out of the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member out of the list and press the S@@ etze button . the current selected member ( their identity ) is bold after you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project happens . an example would be the record of opening and closing of the project , so that later you can see how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the Page Event Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the recipients selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
notes to be entered is simple . it can either be selected from the editor contex@@ tual menu or the @ ann@@ otation Key@@ word in a commentary section followed by note text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , with the nickname of the assigned nickname of the team member , should be given the corresponding area or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of large or small letters , but spaces around brackets are invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for script and form@@ atting , D@@ TD is agnos@@ tic and supported web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be set up by Settings Qu@@ anta , and this dialogue covers some pages that will be treated after each other . &quot;
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; in addition Michel is speaker , blogger and author of several books . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically added attributes . normal Groß / Klein@@ prescri@@ bing means , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : if checked , for tags that the closing tag is optional , this is immediately added to the &amp; quot ; . &quot;
&quot; * First of all , your product is fantas@@ it@@ c . I looked at the others and your code generator app was ins@@ an@@ ely easy to use . &quot;
&quot; automatically update the start and end tag : if on , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate coding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files .
&quot; standard character en@@ coding : the coding of newly created or in other ways , as with file opening opened files ( where the en@@ coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . &quot;
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD has not been recognized . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created perio@@ dic@@ ally backup copies , so that a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be shown either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a map tra@@ der ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings to the standard back to the next start is useful when the user interface changed by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / dependent views . it matches the --@@ res@@ ets layout command line parameters .
the warning messages section provides the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by ad@@ mitting non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ izing the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view in shared mode .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure tree with the mouse button buttons . &quot;
&quot; empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are such where there is no element found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it means that there may be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ you ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins are part @-@ applications of third side , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts are usually refuse the loading when this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the given information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bug@@ ger was completely re @-@ developed . support for the non @-@ needed built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
&quot; currently only one plugin is available , the support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserted . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view where all the points listed , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually , appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will run the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requests . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened by a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it doesn &apos;t have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the b@@ ushes according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document .
&quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens while the script has been started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will proceed . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will proceed . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger takes the next assignment in the script , without going into the functions or include . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger takes the next assignment in the script , whereby if possible , in functions and include it is def@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to ski@@ p the statement and go to the next one , as if there is not the current one . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable is entered or set a new value to a variable . &quot;

&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool tracks . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property dialog@@ s ; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags to a document without risk of a writing fault .
tag @-@ folders are nothing as a folder . they only contain the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag @-@ folders contribute the name of the description language and version . ( for example : html @-@ 4@@ .01 @-@ strict )
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . all about the possibilities and limitations is outlined in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it does not contain anything else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type method . specify the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur for each attribute . it defines the name and type of attribute . in addition it contains further tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
&quot; returns the source code for the attribute in the tag editor dialog , and in the attribute tree . &quot;
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the data source .
&quot; the arguments given to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
defines the position of a tags within a dialog . this tag can only occur for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in dialogue . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each field ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may appear within the defined tags . this element is an element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing but look up &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; can be sub@@ stituted , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools have to start dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , check only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in the following example , for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ Schema . the file name for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following example , for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file shall be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple , and there is an editor that can be re@@ achable via D@@ TD Bear@@ d D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4@@ .01 Transitional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4@@ .01 Transitional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
&quot; an action can set up actions ... created . click New Action , to the same dialog : &quot;
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut is assigned to this action . with clicking the user defined button , you can as@@ sign a single short@@ cut ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est actions . there can be a text in the detailed settings and in the action of the action , this text is inserted in the document to the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the Quick Start dialog , or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script in the following places to find : global scrip@@ ting folder : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the current document URL . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text unique is inserted to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the selection field , input can be determined , which is to send to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode .
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; &quot; edit day &quot; , &quot; if available so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
itt ! is this an ugly icon . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graph Other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly considered los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least sign a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; starting ; -@@ day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it has to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the button and continue with other tags , so there is still which is , or confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . &quot;
&quot; I would like to choose the Tren@@ ner ( left top ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how Tren@@ ner does not support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by checking all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . &quot;
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language you prefer . this is why this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ Document Tree for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you might check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; check if someone has already done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as : &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
note the # before Getting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files .
&quot; the content section is the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is used for designing the context sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file @-@ line lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you stated in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that this is good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation used to use the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ boxes with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places , there is an email @-@ sending menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when Hoch@@ laden , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New Resource dialog , input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the upload must be started . &quot;
&quot; upload can upload from the D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts Tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the statement of the copyright of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there are the easiest way to convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from D@@ TD loading and converting D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description , which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definitions : the string that is in ! Doc@@ type Tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4@@ .01 Transitional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d should appear
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter tries to bring them closer to them , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction applies to a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are stored for anyone who is selected globally in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local items represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editing window , the building views , the card holders with information and the tool@@ bar . please , in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close up the current , other or all map tra@@ der , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marking or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click on the editor area to another context menu with regard to processed document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse po@@ inter or open the file if the string below the mouse po@@ inter refers to a file . &quot;
&quot; the editor &apos;s tool@@ bar is at the top of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4@@ .01 Transitional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars are shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert the data for this just inserted tag , then click the icon that represents the tag . if it is a day that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate and browse in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the presentation with cart@@ el@@ ers , for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation are available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows the administration of files in the project via right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete files from the storage media can then be performed using the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another way of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the relevant users and templates in projects are only available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project will also work here . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document to the element position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element , a list of commands will open a list of commands regarding navigation and refre@@ sher of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears below the other tree views . with it , man@@ gers can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the entry system will enable the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and edited by adding a folder doc to a project . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two card@@ holders at the bottom of the window can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this box shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate branch of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar to email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other backup and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is sensible if you want to custom@@ ize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path is the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder contains . you should also make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before its bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
&quot; while efforts to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to work with a nearby idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of Why develop@@ e what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible , but it allows users and developers to expand their need . &quot;
&quot; this can dramatically increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost any task possible . &quot;
&quot; * First of all , your product is fantas@@ it@@ c . I looked at the others and your code generator app was ins@@ an@@ ely easy to use . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial programme .
&quot; for more details , help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or run hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) . &quot;

&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located , with the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text out of the local / project folder , only a bug is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to &amp; HTML ; spelling , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by browser as form@@ atting instruction . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag . &quot;
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; click button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when you &amp; PHP ; -@@ script failure messages !
select a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .

education and activation of the problem reporter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change the structure tree .
this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries forecast or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents are group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
open an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ i .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; starting and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO bearbeitet ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details . &quot;
loading a project tool bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be stored on tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you haven &apos;t filed the tool@@ bar yet , you will be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
&quot; allows the upload of tool@@ bars to the main server , where each other can access it . see in . &quot;
invite a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; upload / ref@@ resh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refre@@ shed without the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags attached to the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML , ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion is denied using tool@@ bar , if this day contra@@ di@@ cts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plugins are listed below the menu items listed above . click on a activated plug @-@ in . &quot;

&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog influence each application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
alig@@ ns the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; you will find details .
&quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or add them , and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help in the context of the mouse , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and cens@@ ored , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , click here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should ideally be completed from top to bottom , e.g. after completing the project called the entire directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pre@@ j ( eg foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ uni@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adaptation may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web@@ in@@ ty you want to download and change . for server scripts ( e.g. , PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; when files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be included . if a project is started by reason to re @-@ start , it is not attached . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder , and you can make an exact selection according to coup@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the bun@@ ny , par@@ enth@@ eses from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail . additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin can be set with the options . in this case the de@@ bug@@ ger can be set . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , high load profiles can be set ( see in ) as well as the display of a tree view for each profile , by pointing its own construction supervision for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot;
&quot; event events are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
&quot; the project building supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be administr@@ ated in the current project . &quot;
&quot; folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu visible on the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows to remove the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will end to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be retained in the core memory , and forget the program . this option is useful when frequent upload of files is needed , and the rather un@@ reliable password on the disk -@@ option is not available . &quot;
&quot; this will stop the transfer or leave the dialog , if you change your mind before the upload . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ load profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the server name of the server , to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work . &quot;
&quot; the transfer protocol for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and install ki@@ o laun@@ ab . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply scanning the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted in the project or project tool@@ bar , can be easily stored , opened or deleted by the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which you can do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are st@@ acked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be set up either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bar settings in the menu ... and set settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you are presenting to the file system . &quot;
&quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template , before use . &quot;
&quot; binary is everything that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , so images , and PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually inserted into documents by linking ( e.g. images with img src = / src / url ) . &quot;
&quot; documents can be downloaded from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful , if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always included in the documents . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for all websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . there are currently no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to you ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; as soon as this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the templates tree under project templates . &quot;
select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively the selection can be drawn with drag and drop to the construction supervision templates .
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only copied to a folder folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag@@ ging , or inser@@ ting via the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files , you can click on a folder right and create site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can submit header lines and foot@@ ers or link dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files , or link them with them . in addition , you can keep in mind some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates removed files . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above . &quot;
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click on the folder view with the right mouse button and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder . &quot;
allows previous or replic@@ ated text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying content templates into a folder with special header lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate header lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second , divi@@ ding the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor to a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green icon will display the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ ode of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor syn@@ ch@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; the sync distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . if you choose V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation is : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; the document properties dialog is called , as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; it is used to reduce the suspended coding . this is the result of the following : &quot;
meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . meta @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows the change of content such as keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the contents column .
CSS Rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Meta @-@ elements . editing CSS Rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to insert an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and select the corresponding file .
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is like in a word processor , thanks to the arrows , possible . in rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way across the tool@@ bar , as in the source editor . it is to note that tags are not removed from existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , every other anchor tag must be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars , such as the tables assistant , or the Listen Assistant are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examination of style sheets . unlike other programs , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be tra@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to be able to comp@@ ile successfully , need besides &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ xml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; keep in a template , at a place in one of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g @-@ loaded style or xml file or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , sp@@ ai@@ ste stopping points can be set in a particular file and line number and later be enabled . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a file name without path . file names in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded sty@@ ling template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g If for example a style sheet file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ sl is possible :
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete match with a previous name named QNAP ME or a specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template is compatible with any my@@ QNA@@ ME content that contains the string template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ espace in the specified &quot; &quot; my@@ ME &quot; &quot; is expanded according to the rules defined by the nam@@ espace in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ sl : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
this will automatically be checked when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ uns@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation in many places . another progra@@ mmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when mer@@ ging together . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare the text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function is related &amp; k@@ ins@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the results directly . in this editor you can even edit the results directly . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; if you frequently check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble anymore if somebody changes the indentation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color shows the file differently . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ as easier by writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; open dialog enables manually typ@@ ing fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if a file is selected for B and C , if a file is selected , for B and C , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field will be active and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to set an output file immediately . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the compar@@ isons / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &quot;
&quot; you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor , and let it fall over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and inser@@ ting text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data might be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the Info line contains the A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Window C is optional . ) Every info row has a different color . ( note that Window C is optional . ) Every info row has a different color . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info row has a different color . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info row has a different color . ( note that window C is optional . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed over the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , you can see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) well . &quot;
&quot; when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the constitu@@ tive column from the text , is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison windows ) has also a info row with the in@@ scription issue : , the file name and &#91; change &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference must be solved at the same time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the window , the group belonging to the window will be highlighted in all windows , and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this text will not appear in the final saved file , nor in any mark that you might copy and insert elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict , but appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy the text from the result window . &quot;
&quot; note : if selecting the options for ignor@@ ing the options or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the keyboard . if you click on one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , side up , side off , beginning , end , str@@ g start and str@@ g end , si@@ w how you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click on the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in section Merg@@ ing and edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last distinction , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ stream ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line feed command \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use W@@ agen@@ reco@@ il + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not re@@ tains the new@@ lines of the source files , therefore you should not use binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically and re @-@ manufactured at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ings@@ - &gt; K@@ Tap 3 ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in recur@@ sive script . if the script does not support this presentation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be stream@@ lined . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted at pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you push the input or return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . copying the manual into the cli@@ p@@ board is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; you can select , which line end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used . &quot;
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in source files . the second step compar@@ es each line . the second step compar@@ es each line . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others save only one line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic forwar@@ ding mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will be continued . &quot;
&quot; automatically trig@@ gers all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts coming from the merge menu . note that automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are treated in the chapter for scanning of folders and direc@@ tories , and look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ orig . if you already have such backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ orig , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option is not the current running program . you need to start &amp; re@@ start so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is globally controlled via the control centre ) .
&quot; the following code settings can be set for each entry separately . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; on the selection fields for the en@@ coding , a short notice indicates what the local en@@ coding is . ( this cannot be changed here , and has a purely informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file en@@ coding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . because the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can handle only 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II ) . &quot;
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color coded text column . but sometimes you may want to see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just make the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pre@@ defined name for the output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ start the merge again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only when the command is set . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to allow the user to create more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program this . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are sufficient . &quot;
&quot; use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the input into capital letters : SED &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a bold expression of the text in a row . \ \ 1 in the translation string refers to the found text in the first stap@@ ler string . the \ \ U trans@@ forms the found text in upper@@ case letters . &quot;
&quot; CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically create generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word substitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ SCH@@ LE@@ S@@ SEL@@ WOR@@ T created text . &quot;
&quot; while you experiment with sed experim@@ entation , you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good , for example , for a further pre @-@ processing command for line spac@@ es. sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 678@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hits will be replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you might want to perform several missions at once . then , you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the settings from each other . example : &quot;
&quot; instead of cur@@ sed , you can also use something different like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / substitution / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; All , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . the other operations only alter the data that the Zei@@ l@@ eline @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus is seen .
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line spac@@ er pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in one folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes for each object a proposal to merge ; you can custom@@ ize the proposal before starting
... &quot; can simul@@ ate the mer@@ ging , showing the simulated changes without really doing it , &quot;
... &quot; select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just need to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no target folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically start , do not merge . to start mer@@ ging , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will inform a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files will be listed , which were compared to that date . &quot;
&quot; if the folder is scanning the folder , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side ... &quot;
&quot; each file and each folder , found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - , or double clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such case the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge process is started , you will be informed about the problems of this type again . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; the color is identical to identical entries , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and no explicit target folders are specified , and if the option direc@@ tories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders will be identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ ins@@ 3 ; B after A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged , and select the new version of the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) is checked , then an error message appears : files are different but the date is identical .. When the files are different but the date is identical .. If such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folder cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during mer@@ ging , a file is processed after the other . the status column shows Fer@@ tig when the mer@@ ging was successful , and corresponding to other messages when something unexpected happened . when mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is okay . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected for full analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts only appear if three folders are compared or merged ) . &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , then the Three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as a target , and B and / or B is used as a target for synchron@@ izing A and / or B . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries in the target folder should be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / resume in the directory -@@ Menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key code ) . to just merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if there are still invalid mer@@ ging actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears on the def@@ ective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options through , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see what would happen without the real changes , you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( check the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again re@@ start / resume or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to make the cause of the problem . so you have the possibility to select another action for the entry , or to solve the problem in a different way before you proceed with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually composed , see &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and execute them in the later merge of all entries . even if the mer@@ ging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be deleted . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Tap 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files based on the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic created files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to files : if the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : if the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if it is applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ sample . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders to a slow network , it may be faster to compare the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage does not cost you a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; similar to the confi@@ denti@@ ality of the ch@@ anges@@ date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical , if they are equal . this can be useful for example when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is checked in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activate the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared , and no target folder was specified . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , then merge the copy of the newer file as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe , because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is shut down in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ orig extension already , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch the window pan@@ ler with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the window pan@@ ter with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . nevertheless , there are also a menu entry in the directory menu . you can also directly merge a single file directly without having to run the folder together . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. contain . that is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can &apos;t be differenti@@ ated if a link shows a file or a folder . then , a file is assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , per@@ missions or change date devi@@ ates from the original . ( please note the option confi@@ denti@@ ality of the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is at present as a difference viewer in K@@ Devel@@ op . K@@ DE@@ VELO@@ P first starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ SO 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch patch will start to recover the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select a preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that it does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , it is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ SO 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program is diff@@ using from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
&quot; this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this path , or are going to go this way . &quot;
&quot; in the default configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information about this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is often the most often the case . &quot;
&quot; this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as text file , and it &apos;s too much effort to create extra @-@ own file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort has been too large so far . you can always restore a certain version through selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text you should use another editor .
&quot; after removing the text , it is suddenly lt ; No src is left ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using , and lack the purpose . please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !

&quot; ( in the current program version , you have to re @-@ read the folder with the function update . ) &quot;
&quot; if the target folder does not contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably change in a later program version . ) This option is shut down in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with caption A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are hung from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , clicking on the button will be removed . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . under@@ score in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work@@ space , change their size , stop them , or shift them . this works both within a working space and multiple . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can show all virtual work@@ space , as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click on , the context menu only contains the two entries . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the name of the virtual work@@ space is displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . if it is crossed together with name , the names are marked with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st working area . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces will be displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default icon and pixel map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the main window can be determined : classic lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , all virtual work@@ spaces appear in a horizontal and vertical form in a vertical row , which is very good for the presentation at the side on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as symbols or with their content and move . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
&quot; click the right mouse button inside of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; followed by selecting switch , the dialog settings appear . &quot;
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you must register as user root or contact your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; this application is interesting for different users : artists , Web designers and people with a visual handi@@ cap . this is intended to be a complete manual for use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced by new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; if you like &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag is a magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window is referred to as magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; as an alternative , you can make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse at the screen edge ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting of mouse cur@@ sor . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the drop @-@ down window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window , and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; Shift , press the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ down window remains firm and only the lower right corner is moved . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , copy a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
start or stop updating the display . stopping the update causes that the required CPU time is against zero .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very Low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ line ( with the button document re@@ load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Size &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use an area of the screen , so you would use a magni@@ fying glass to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for various people : from research or artist to web designer or visually han@@ dic@@ apped . &quot;

&quot; it is intended to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I Syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) , and those of each mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor holds a while on the same place . it is intended to help people suffering from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and that each mouse @-@ click can em@@ ulate pain . however , this requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to avoid aches that are caused by the mouse , it is against pain caused by the mouse button , useless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result may be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse click as soon as you break down the movement shortly .
&quot; the intelligent displac@@ ement is activated , power &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before releasing the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the mouse movement , this time must be stored before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if the mouse button is switched on , the Shift @-@ field is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . &quot;
&quot; these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider General . there is a slider control sound buffer that you set to a lower value to sh@@ orten response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please refer to the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the last press of users . &quot;
&quot; best use you &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be turned off first . if you are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the automatic mouse click , you can then take the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of what places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link , does not result in unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse pul@@ ls , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to remove the mouse button . as this happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rollers . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scratch the dirt and dirt . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent displac@@ ement in this case , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can use a mouse click yourself . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want to have it . but par@@ ken the mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop , if you want to make a button . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with intelligent displac@@ ement , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent displac@@ ement is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent link when you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use . instead , select text instead as follows : run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text , and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this helps each time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test extension must be installed for &amp; X Window ; that should be the case on most system . &quot;
&quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available , if the system has a sound card and loud@@ speaker and are set up correctly . &quot;
&quot; this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and to those who are pressed by the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; in this way , drag and drop with the mouse can also be performed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the silent user to let her computer speak for herself . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command , which is later used for the speech output of text . for more details , please refer to the description of the setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text password . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) you decide the dictionary for the terms of the word . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can ab@@ ide the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org @-@ dictionary so that only correct letter words can be recorded . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the sentences you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory memory . you can select sets that are to be spoken once again . &quot;
&quot; set settings to mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ Transi@@ tions and the side of the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the language output , you specify the command to call the voice generator . in the selection box below the input field , set the character en@@ coding to be passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is unchanged as default input to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command will depend on the voice output from your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples can be found in the App@@ endix . &quot;
&quot; the k@@ tt@@ s@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; the k@@ tt@@ s@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications require a stand@@ ar@@ dised interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a passage passage , you determine which action by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text@@ book or in the bar for text fit books . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the selection of In the input field , the selected passage passage will first be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection field , you can set the editing window to be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when selecting a text password file , the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text password file is not saved . &quot;
&quot; the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right side , you can delete or add dic@@ tionaries , modify the order of the books , or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org @-@ dictionary to just insert properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tionaries . &quot;
&quot; this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , you will create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for processing text pass@@ ag@@ ings is two parts . in the upper part , the text pass@@ ag@@ les are represented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a passage passage , you can change the passage or the associated key short@@ cut . if you have selected a text@@ book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop down menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text passages or text passages , you can change by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; alt ; key . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected parts of the disk storage . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text @-@ cut is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected parts of the disk storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the follow @-@ up storage . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a mov@@ able tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands will be displayed . the tool@@ bar is ordered by default over the editing window directly under the menu bar . by click on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding bar for text fit books with entries will be displayed . by default , the bar is positioned directly below the tool@@ bar . by the mouse click on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; probably , you don &apos;t have the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card menu . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ overs @-@ system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival will be installed in the / usr / local / festival . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ etz folder . the language output is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to cr@@ ush the text in phon@@ eme . licence allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last note of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo ) ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option must be enabled as default input must be enabled .
the voice @-@ output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
&quot; since the setting of the voice generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use k@@ tt@@ s@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; for setting , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can leave text by the computer . it is stored in a list of already saved sentences that the user can always re@@ write again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice synthes@@ izer contains . a voice synthes@@ izer needs to be installed on the computer .
&quot; more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of modules existing , allowing each application to read text about the &amp; DB@@ us ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programm@@ ers ready , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . &quot;
&quot; read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; , even if &amp; kate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications . &quot;
&quot; speech output takes place via the speech dispat@@ cher program , the various background program such as peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the generation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ help program .
&quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; speech @-@ Markup @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and speech @-@ Markup @-@ Meta @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services over &amp; DB@@ us ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of k@@ tt@@ s@@ d over k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or sharing thereof .
&quot; a module for the text editor &amp; kate ; , with which a text file can be read completely or partially . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ zilla database from &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find the list of https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ .@@ de. &quot;
&quot; before you can use , you must install program speech dispat@@ cher and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card menu speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card is displayed . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ ths offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that distinguish themselves in volume or speed . &quot;
different Spe@@ akers for the same Synthes@@ izer are comparable to multiple printer drivers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the map tra@@ der speaker in k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , the card menu is displayed . this will appear automatically when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already established actors appear in this list . the preferred speaker is shown above in the list . the top speaker is used for speech output if there is no speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a j@@ unk and girl voice to choose . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card board speaker . to change the driver &apos;s settings , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts . go back to the card card General and check if voice output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the card card orders to create and manage text orders . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de voice output system ; click on the card @-@ tra@@ der General to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; if k@@ tt@@ sm@@ t@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ h appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ reading is finished . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can start text orders , cancel , pause and record text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; press cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click &quot; &quot; App@@ ly or OK &quot; , &quot; then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map tra@@ der General and enable voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can pre @-@ read the text of the displayed website . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML , lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text . first check , whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then select the text that is supposed to be read , and select the text that should be read , and then select the language output . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; reads ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can also notify the text of these messages as well . you can read the text of these messages as well .
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ figuration ; , the IRC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . you can set up a message when a message appears in a IRC channel where your nickname appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IRC message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry notification in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on application . &quot;
&quot; you remove the tags br and b from the messages sent to mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as assumed . read this too . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech dispat@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace incor@@ rectly spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dispat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of news and normal text .
&quot; a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application which uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can use &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest is simple text orders . each job you encounter from the card card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four types of order are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen re@@ els . if an application sends output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ els . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders , and on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Nachrichten . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future it can still be more kinds of filters .
&quot; strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts can be used either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be supplied with pre @-@ defined strings , which allow the creation of chat emot@@ icons like : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format into another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; if you have set a female voice for example , you can read the text from K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter is determined that its rules do not apply , the text remains unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters displayed on the page . editing by the filter takes place in the list from above . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are set up from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and the following setup dialog@@ s will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; for your filter , enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name , it must only be distinguished by the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is registered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker is speaking for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button at the mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter only applies if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by commas . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs will get you with the q@@ d@@ bus , . the &amp; DB@@ us ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you can only enter copies . &quot;
&quot; if all the input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the character chain replacement filter defines regular expression in the \ \ s word \ \ s. words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ating characters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the box .
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such forms . but it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c help program must be installed on your system .
&quot; specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; with the voice selection filter , you can send texts to a certain speaker , which is set up on the card board , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can , for example , specify that texts should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . it is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the properties of the speaker you requested . if the text meets the above mentioned filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which is best suited to the desired requirements . click on the right to view the speaker selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to store or store your speech settings , or delete all settings . &quot;
&quot; the voice selection filters are only applied to the text , if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if you apply . you have to register at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; DB@@ us . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , using the language synthes@@ izer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ DB@@ us ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the full documentation for both AP@@ Is is available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility Website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bili@@ ty@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output data via the &amp; DB@@ us ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the k@@ tt@@ s@@ d program to the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; text of the text to read and select a language code , such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you can use .
&quot; open two &amp; console ; window . just start k@@ tt@@ s@@ d in a window , then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ shaping filter , but when using the module for festival sites , websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , that SA@@ BLE works at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only cau@@ ti@@ ously . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the character en@@ coding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may possibly be fixed by a string release filter . see . &quot;

&quot; KT@@ TS is working with every speech synthes@@ izer , which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the speech dispat@@ cher program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend the use of a different synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the XML ; conversion filter , but it is not mandatory . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs and the program files for the speech dispat@@ cher program . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source text of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source repository for k@@ de@@ cco , or downloaded every night currently created t@@ arb@@ all , translate and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use it , check first if speech dispat@@ cher works with your language synthes@@ izer . you can use the sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the speech dispat@@ cher program . the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ g should be further developed that the establishment of speech dispat@@ chers is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can withdraw its sentence , or withdraw , repe@@ ating or cancel the issue . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its sex is female , it is used automatically . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map speaker to add , and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the card menu speaker unit is displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules please see . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to PAT@@ H is included , you will need to enter only festival . &quot;
&quot; in general , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider controls , you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of controllers and display this gray , the vote selected by you cannot be selected . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check@@ box , these voices are already loaded when starting K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory usage ) the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check@@ box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click on the user ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , you will see the k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr program window at the start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ t@@ gr does not work , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the just edited set . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can specify in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or back . ( but not every order consists of multiple sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card maps ) are taken over and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Audio Card Audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text entries are listed and administr@@ ated . output of screen re@@ a@@ vers , warnings and messages will not be displayed . for more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts , please find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or kt@@ ts ; it cannot load the required libraries . &quot;
&quot; if there are no output modules in the list , you have to install at least one module . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; set the speech speed here . 50@@ percent ; % corresponds to half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double standard speaking speed . in order to be implemented , the so@@ x program must be installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt select standard .
&quot; on this card map , you can set specific actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority .
warnings have priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the issue of news and normal text .
&quot; news has the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you read and eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sounds and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for news , warnings and the issues of screen re@@ a@@ vers there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ t@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the map noti@@ fications will be noti@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent if someone men@@ tions your nickname in an IRC message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this selection field to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do , when an event occurs . you have the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the subscri@@ ber here . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map speaker as the top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a specific event is specified for a specific application , it is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
&quot; the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the button to save the settings for noti@@ fications to a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Delete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Markup Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for the control of voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the standard voice , the festival in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival Con@@ figuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very monot@@ on@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters , normal filters and set @-@ level detection filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . &quot;
&quot; in the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , you can automatically set up a set @-@ level recognition filter . you can change its settings or add further sentence level detection filters , but beginners will get out of it . &quot;
&quot; in the simpl@@ est way , you will learn to set up the selection of speech selection by trying . switch on the language selection and enter the text to read . if you have to set up the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker changes . you have to have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; you can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this feature . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter is automatically set up if you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut down , just removed . don &apos;t change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
note that the default level of recogni@@ zing filter will retain the character set before the filter .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ news ( notify ) , warnings , news or the output of screen re@@ els . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal sentence level recogni@@ zing filter , you can paste it again by charging the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the map menu , you can over@@ write the language settings for the application . the card card is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the highest on the map speaker ) . in other words : no speaking abilities are specified .
&quot; if you don &apos;t delete or edit the subscri@@ ber &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; select the speaker , which is best suited to the original set @-@ up properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the required speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the subscri@@ ber . if this property does not play a role , don &apos;t enter anything . &quot;
&quot; select this check box , if the property should have preced@@ ence over other features . you can also set several markers here . &quot;
&quot; since language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . &quot;
&quot; to delete all properties in the field speaker , which is closest to the following , click on the selection buttons standard speaker and then use the speaker that is closest to the following . &quot;

&quot; k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any feedback . &quot;

&quot; the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work when I play music at the same time with another application music . if I get a text order , freeze &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears : unable to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem arises that conflicts with AL@@ SA do occur , which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please refer to the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I have invited an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr doesn &apos;t show that voice .
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / k@@ tt@@ s@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices add the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the audio card audio , there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and will be able to locate the PAT@@ H environment variable . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) Use either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .@@ x@@ sl @-@ file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ forming filter , and set up the speaking speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;

AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
note : make sure that the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( http : / / g@@ ass@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system counts , you can &apos;t stop playing music at the same time and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freeze when you stop a text message and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA website ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will still be read . &quot;
Debian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs are already included .
&quot; if you download &amp; kt@@ ts ; than t@@ arb@@ all ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , sign up as normal user and un@@ zip the t@@ arb@@ all into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created on request . &quot;
the following modules for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run time dependency of non @-@ free software .
&quot; default is &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example &quot;
&quot; on Debian systems , / usr / local is the correct folder for programs which are translated from sources . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; before you use it , check first if your language synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help with this can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cyrillic ( 8 bit ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . therefore , search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the coding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cyrillic , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete speech output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the festival / lib / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . it is required either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA , then download MS German Festival of &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for using Festival 2.0 , the play of the error correction is not required ; you only need to re@@ comp@@ ile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m file . &quot;
&quot; voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 2 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Male , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems , you must edit the / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al.@@ sc@@ m file . just add the lines to your installed German voices . replace the right path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , De@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices are not working with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
&quot; this procedure uses special code to give the language about the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and get at first festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA , and make sure that both work . then invite the festival @-@ Czech from &quot;
un@@ zip the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the ency@@ clo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your PAT@@ H .

&quot; Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ il@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice synthes@@ izer , which currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . &quot;
&quot; Fli@@ te is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions , so search for your distribution on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage syn@@ th synthes@@ izer , which works with Di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ ph@@ ons and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip to the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o or / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ xy is a free , qu@@ il@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener speech synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple language synthes@@ izer with a balanced voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; if the Epo@@ s programs do not stand in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to programs on the map speaker . in the input fields , you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; con@@ sole ; e@@ pos -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ il@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language synthes@@ izer , which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can neither adjust pitch , volume nor speaking speed . &quot;
&quot; the command mode allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in one &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting the K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ centers ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device shows and setting the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed in installing and installed . if network devices are added later , the driver must be re@@ charged by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version . &quot;
&quot; the module network settings will be loaded , if the option to select network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network setup , this allows to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the hands @-@ free selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list to select from the list that is best suited to distribution and release . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before all options are shown gray , which means that settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , you will get system administration mode on the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three sem@@ en : &quot;
&quot; the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
&quot; the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list , and clicking the Kn@@ op@@ ard interface ... in the dialog unit . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Automati@@ cally , TCP / IP settings are retri@@ eved from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information to each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of manu@@ als , you can set the TCP / IP configuration without D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask the sub@@ net mask is set . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; if required , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching off an switched network device is activated by selecting the list and clicking interface . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on your needs . switching off an activated network device is selected by selecting the list and clicking interface . &quot;
&quot; defines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be able to understand IP addresses . if the machine is calling http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator for the nam@@ ing solution part of the Rei@@ ters nam@@ ing solution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button , add ... from the group host to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add New nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog . &quot;
&quot; first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server , then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group computer for nam@@ ing resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... &quot;
&quot; the list of commonly known hosts describes the host name IP address references for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily at boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of known hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ alo@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known host and click &quot; Add .... Add New alias .
&quot; enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , press the button add several times and enter the alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit ... The friend machine dialog is displayed .
&quot; it can be one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts is updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , you have to set the following command . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .org ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t is installed .
installing the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install the rpm package as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical user can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this will only be recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile and comp@@ ile the following commands . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second one will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files . &quot;
&quot; this area may not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endix , only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is communic@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is to be accessed . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact person who accepts a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , therefore their arbitrary use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateway . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the net address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local one machine . normally , the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to your own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , are affected and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content to be found in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is re@@ ordered by scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand as expected can occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first consisted of creating a surface for tar , which offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing . &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; how@@ l the band back and reads the pre@@ tension information of the band . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the pre @-@ registration on the band , you will be asked if the tape is to be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape is changed to indicate that the tape was included . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a change of the symbol for the band , that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be thrown out without danger . &quot;
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat .
&quot; a band type must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the format at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive needs to be form@@ atted before use , it must happen before you can form@@ atted a tape before use . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require a form@@ atting of tape , DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat record the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the files that are to be examined . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree , only this file or folder is saved . &quot;
select a f@@ use profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a check@@ box . only the so @-@ marked files and / or sub@@ folders are saved .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click the local file tree and select File ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog box opens . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives for the band with a check@@ box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are tested .
&quot; with the right mouse button in one of the archives , select the menu item Test .... &quot;
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings for verification , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the examination procedure as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the tape drive . only select the selected file or sub@@ folder . &quot;
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check@@ box . only the so @-@ marked files and / or sub@@ folders are recovered .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Rest@@ ore menu .... &quot;
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings for recovery , dialog appears to restore . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the band index file on the basis of the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band : &quot;
&quot; in this way , a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings will be created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current work folder , in which the backup is to be made , will be automatically updated according to the selected working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files are stored in the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are on other file systems , can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently from the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the recent incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files are saved , which have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and create a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
you can set the settings via the K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ R@@ ew@@ in@@ ding -@@ variant of the band unit .
&quot; if this setting is active , forwar@@ ded &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is attached , the command ts load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when you delete &amp; k@@ dat , you will automatically disc@@ ard the band . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must inform &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size will be shared for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a volume is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should only show a memory block on the band . the content of the file is as follows : &quot;
seconds is the number of seconds that have been form@@ atted since the era in which the volume has been form@@ atted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the rest of the files on the band are tar archives , which can be administ@@ ered directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; observer for system logs . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , you can quickly access information about problems that appear on your server . &quot;
&quot; the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system is stored in the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; try to provide some advanced features , which can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log , a number of useful features include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ s@@ log Server and Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen shot , displays &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with their help to filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily , and the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after startup attempts &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - is not shown , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not have a system administrator rights . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected crit@@ erion , or string . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry in this place . for example , the string of the filter search term will only be available with entries in the corresponding column . &quot;
&quot; this option is enabled in default setting , and helps you identify the key protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; if you want to show just a certain process ( for example , in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can show the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can ski@@ p the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log on the display in the menu . &quot;

&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system is swi@@ ft@@ ly developed for the control of the program starts when starting the system in the &amp; Linux world . it is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to go on historical aspects here ( for example because I don &apos;t know about myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to move a machine on System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and re@@ form@@ atting . therefore , you must be sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc , instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not contain such things as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ set@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ defined run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change this then you can re@@ boot / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . be very cau@@ tious if you have succ@@ um@@ bed to the in@@ it@@ tab changes . &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the real scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level running only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc ; starting . &quot;
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another mouse is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can move scripts also between run@@ level@@ s , or change the position within a level by pulling it elsewhere . this will only happen if they draw up an entry from the field of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must expres@@ sly choose copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ti@@ ern@@ ary number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the list numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to include the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the trash bin , so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the various work@@ spaces ( Available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sort number or name of an entry manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu will require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ SIGN / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are recovered from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise it will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise it will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts continually . what can I do ? &quot;
then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary setting programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately is no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are needed by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) can be termin@@ ated without notice if their configuration files are not present or incor@@ rectly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this can be added to this manual . &quot;
&quot; this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the user and group of your system . &quot;
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save them . either , use the appropriate symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry saved in the menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , user and user list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are displayed only if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have enabled plac@@ ements ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created when you can make individual settings . other card cards appear , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd are installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the card pass password management appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; this card card only appears if for at least one embedded file system Plac@@ ement ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the limited space restrictions in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field of file system with space limitation .
&quot; the map group inform@@ s about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , belonging to the user , can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ arian group . furthermore , users can join in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s dialog properties contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select the user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group , or click the appropriate add button to the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works similarly . &quot;
&quot; this module allows you to install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add the boot password , remove and change the time to boot the standard operating system , add the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more . &quot;
