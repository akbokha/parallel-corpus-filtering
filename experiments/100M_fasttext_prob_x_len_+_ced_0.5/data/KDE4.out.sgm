<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is the colours that have been photographed or scanned by your camera or scanner. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are identical to those of your camera or scanners, and that the colours you print or publish on the web from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, links with deeper information will enable you to make informed decisions about your own informed decisions so you can get the desired results."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other image editions are via email or web, where sRGB is de-facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so simple, why should one use another color gamut and thus have to worry about colour management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the hug-shaped region, and colours in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colours, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent page and click Info and then Information About RGB working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor when I decided to work in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you work in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to calibrate your monitor as sRGB works. if you are working as a colour gamut of sRGB, you will need to calibrate your monitor on the sRGB standard, using a suitable monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting a further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best at your photo. if you have any queries, please contact us on Tel.: + 49 5764 318 444. or contact us per email."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminosity value over the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"like this: this method adjusts the color of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic balance: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue duct."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jibe of all values in-between. this is only visible in full-blown images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly limited to a color gamut with 8 bits per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left-hand side, both the original picture and the preview of the target picture are adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"at the top, a histogram shows that dynamic changes will be changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play anstate with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to calculate the color temperature of the white balance."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is shown in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons store as and store are exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set, you can save it into a text file and load it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will be shown as your original. if you store them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. but this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">"this tool gives the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the Hellies. a detailed instructions for using color profiles, you can consult the chapter" "Colour Management". ""</seg>
<seg id="408">"this tool provides an integrated way to store multiple color channels at the same time, allowing you to use it for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">"a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find gradation in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digikam; tool color effects provide you four color effects, a solar panel effect, a velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when you completed a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this was the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what chemically possible. another upliftment creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar-ization effect. the original image is the (1) and the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a reverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neonfilter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large pictures, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">"digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it's not unusual to change color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you are applied."</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you can make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too great saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can do in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve exposure."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range."</seg>
<seg id="421">"the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the knob, and take care of how the picture changes."</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box, you can set the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called Gammaxes."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinholes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and light tones. moreover, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values as in the input values.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and store: with these buttons, the set values stored in the file system can be stored and reloaded later. to do this, the Gimp Levels format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, medium and sun sets. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the histogram for red, green, blue and the Luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect to see the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you see an example of adjusting the input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2)."</seg>

<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows the channel to be changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a curveil to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond to darker output tones and darker will be darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"the preview of the original photos is a red marker. if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste."</seg>
<seg id="437">"save as and store: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each turn you have created can be saved in the file system and then be loaded later. the file format is the Gimp curve format."</seg>
<seg id="438">"if you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium- and sunscreen. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminance curve."</seg>
<seg id="439">"the overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposure pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect to see the final result."</seg>

<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digikam; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the color channel-mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">"with the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint as you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash."</seg>
<seg id="444">"the preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position them in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the appropriate colour value."</seg>
<seg id="445">"controls for the module are below: controls for red, green and construction allows you to mix these channels."</seg>
<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color to a visible noise leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you first reduce the colour space first."</seg>
<seg id="447">"the saving as and loading buttons are used for this purpose. any blender setting can save you later, and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format."</seg>

<seg id="479">"& digikam, three different tools are available for sharpness. each of you has advantages in other areas."</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocusing is perhaps the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adapting."</seg>
<seg id="483">"images without focus, and most digital images require a correction of sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="484">"JPEG pictures often have a camera internal sharpness. images in the raw format, on the other hand, have to be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"if you disable this, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening tool. this can be used with the menu entry Corrigation."</seg>
<seg id="487">"in general, the most useful technique is to focus on the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique is to refocus the tool. in general, the most useful technique is to refocus the tool. you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to draw softeners with the menu entry Corrigation soft draw and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview will help you to edit the image. the preview window shows the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tried first."</seg>
<seg id="492">"high resolution images allow greater radii. therefore, you should be able to sharpen images best in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiser picture, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimal difference can be defined for an edge of the filter."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masks were used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocus an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected design filter -algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a sharpness mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding is much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which depends on the mathematical result from the source pixel, which is far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular edge: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module.</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, and eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness Gauß is. in most cases, you should have this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero zero, you may also increase the correlation and / or the additive filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. increasing the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circle-shaped sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter that you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cuts, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before modifying the picture."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, and eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, Unsharp masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blushing a larger neighborhood as a sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, unsharp masks must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied to a small unfocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture was made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>

<seg id="514">"if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the widest developed tool to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CIMG project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grading or CCD noise, a high value wave-like pattern will produce a high value. JPEG Artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle stepwidth da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrals [0,1, 10]: integrated stepwidth in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing, and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the more quality you get by choosing this option is only low, but it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to let it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">"the buttons store as and store are exactly this. each setting of image errors can be rectified in a text file, and later reloaded."</seg>
<seg id="528">"correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob."</seg>

<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filter to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moiretic; the effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="536">"if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge precision for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, don't remove all noise or noise spikes. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG image file without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">"luminance: controls the brightness tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process, which is controlled by the details settings."</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamut tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically sharpened, but also pollutes the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjustment of phase jittery attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius reacts on variations of luminous density. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and later.</seg>

<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photoartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grabbing, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images."</seg>

<seg id="561">Durcut: an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined. the resulting color will be assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">"square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block."</seg>
<seg id="564">"cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubical curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block."</seg>

<seg id="569">"with the large exposure ranges of today's film and color and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using a centerfilter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three controls, you can control the vignment correction filter and with three further exposure to the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of intensity absorption at the point of the greatest density the filter. the default density is 2,0, which is equivalent to an optical filter with a aperture adjustment of 1, or accidentally a luminous intensity of 2, relaxing. Increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignment, reduce it to compensate for a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the vignette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you will need to adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options, as you only need to increase the settings."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the digikam; image processing from the color gradation menu."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"these images often have a moiré pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. in general, images with this property look better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you turn anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a beam of pixels. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"and Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling the adjacent pixel is adaptively. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive, because each pixel is continuously fragmented and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colour values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam of pixels. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels is exceeded, both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a lattice of 4x4 additional points will be calculated with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, the pixels are divided into 4 sub-pixels, which can be tracked individually and checked for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth of depth."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch to Jittering, change & Povray; the rays for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1525">"--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting."</seg>

<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI Maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">"a MIDI map is a text file, which stores all necessary changes to play a piece."</seg>

<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section, you specify how the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use is as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the sign character is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you cannot change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gunshot."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"if so, if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (gunshot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that the term" "Trommel patch" "is meant here, where each tone is another percussioning instrument (drum, cymbal, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone is the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as well as its presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names only in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"keymaps are used above all to form sounds on the percussion channel. see, for example, the included keymaps."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section may be used to replicate some channels on others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply make the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the KEYMAP option, the KEYMAP must naturally be defined in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored if you want to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussion channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch billing event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only relayed. the value 4096 is used so that the map file does not have decimal commas."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is used because GM anticipates that a keyboard that will play a pitch biting event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards are trying to play two tones up to a octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboard sounds, see which sounds are played."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't illuminate green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to view the played sounds. view the view in the Settings menu under the channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text you can slow down it. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, etc; so that the same MIDI file can perform very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support it has been compiled. to eliminate the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution system (for example from kmid; 's Home)"</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system is swiftly developed for the control of the program starts when starting the system in the & Linux world. it is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going to go on historical aspects here (for example because I don't know about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to move a machine on System V Init without installing a new installation and reformatting. therefore, you must be sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc, instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not contain such things as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.setserial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the pre-defined runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change this then you can reboot / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very cautious if you have succumbed to the inittab changes."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the real scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel running only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & kdm;, network & etc; starting."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv;. it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another mouse is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can move scripts also between runlevels, or change the position within a level by pulling it elsewhere. this will only happen if they draw up an entry from the field of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must expressly choose copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sortiernary number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the list numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to include the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the trash bin, so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the various workspaces (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sort number or name of an entry manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu will require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDESIGN / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are recovered from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise it will be recovered by & ksysv; otherwise it will be stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine starts continually. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Then edit the / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setting programs of these distributions, but unfortunately is no standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are needed by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) can be terminated without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this can be added to this manual."</seg>
