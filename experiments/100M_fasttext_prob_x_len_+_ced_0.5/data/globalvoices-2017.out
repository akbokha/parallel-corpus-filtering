&quot; although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is exce@@ ed@@ ingly great .
&quot; how many of my generation I grew up with American movies , have d@@ anced to American music , read American writers and run their sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orters who wanted to occupy the murder@@ ous plot of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Roberts . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; according to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration for the USA had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to accept in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very warm@@ ly love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he walks with his narrow @-@ face .
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops the mountain , as you say so nicely . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and openly declar@@ es his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won in Republican elections , was the highest number given by the party nomin@@ ee nomin@@ ee . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalism program that takes people out of all over the world , a deeply believing person , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump &apos;s world@@ view did not agree with the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; game .
&quot; Tr@@ umps intoler@@ ance also stands in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who lived for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , which always helped me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lo@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice has helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values embo@@ died by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump seized his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they were either separated from racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy the people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial , respect@@ less and implies an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the h@@ ectic change in their communities .
&quot; could it be that those voters , of whom most knows , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. d . Ü . : as much as &quot; rebel@@ lion of the Wh@@ ites against all other ethni@@ cities &quot; ; word@@ play made of white in connection to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it called the great Van Jones , has exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have , America is welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with choosing Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , was my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for whom his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is Tr@@ umps Land now , &quot; &quot; said the message . &quot;
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find any place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of Cat@@ ech@@ a ?
&quot; the music that is played at both places not only has changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big g@@ arbage d@@ ump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of years , the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the church : one of children and adults existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become central interest to the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a coinci@@ dence meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered his youth a rare glimpse of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members are very serious about their commitments to the music group , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi writes : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you will always laugh and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mbone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from g@@ arbage
&quot; more than 7@@ 5,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ ech@@ a - a village that is virtually at the top of the biggest g@@ arbage d@@ ump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ay@@ an capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ conditioned instruments composed of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , contra@@ bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made out of the trash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of Cat@@ ech@@ a , recalls the early days : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in g@@ arbage The children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact their parents because many of them didn &apos;t live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed as a b@@ abo@@ o , which he never had seen before : a violin made of waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic g@@ arbage d@@ ump ) draws the musical performance :
the world generates about 1 billion tons of g@@ arbage each year .
&quot; those who live with Him and from Him are the poor@@ est - like humans in Cat@@ ech@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of g@@ arbage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played its music even before the Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that targeted international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices , the re @-@ publishing occurs on the common use of content . &quot;
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it was looking for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly upset , and little inclined to welcome a law break@@ er of this kind in their co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Sey@@ ch@@ elles mobili@@ sed swi@@ ft@@ ly against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia because of pl@@ under@@ ing the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop illegal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the Premier from their waters back then . &quot;
&quot; &quot; so we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and are mut@@ ually involved in dealing with illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is captured is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . therefore illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once imp@@ eded by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , in real time , actions are happening in real time , tra@@ ce@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there you can exchange existing licenses for each other , including news on susp@@ icious activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a harb@@ or inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive , when they move on the open seas by satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas , such as those that indicate that a ship loads his caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fish fan@@ fare , where they were on the way and possibly , if they were a criminal . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports based on this information , meaning that the ships can &apos;t sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay fin@@ es , as in the prime minister &apos;s case . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of n@@ f@@ d Africa . the latter is a consultant that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to win a estimated 20 million USD worth of lost revenues , which lost eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fish@@ eries that enter East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing companies .
&quot; their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake licence papers , stating of fanta@@ sies , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the missing international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship was illegal fishing and a country could then say &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have to run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; . &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; so far , the closed front has been working . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected ships . &quot;
&quot; it has discovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has been persec@@ uted and found fle@@ eting ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to make susp@@ icious ships more precise .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , also helps to det@@ ach the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that we try to cross , &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Chief analyst at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , who also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; for example , some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be shipped by satelli@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Cop@@ eland is helping to build a system that combines different information levels . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminals with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and consoli@@ date their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have a similar project with which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; Shi@@ ri App@@ le@@ by in &quot; &quot; Code Black &quot; &quot; dabei &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats buy more licenses since then . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found on board tow@@ ing nets whose use is prohibited . &quot;

&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars are destroyed by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries joined together to go to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they now fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country was able to report its first great triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag . &quot;

street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the release of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ tians re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emp@@ tin@@ ess by gathering in the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) can be seen from these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led to other parts of the country - among other things , in the flat land of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central North of the state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country wor@@ sen@@ ed continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the administration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to establish a new governance alliance . &quot;

especially large waves hit the news of police repression in the central @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
&quot; hours later , they could leave the cathedral back safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira carry no skirts , because you could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic is making the round which forms the extent of oppression per day : &quot;
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial warning - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many people by the presence of countless people on the street .

&quot; others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and has rather been busy making critical voices : &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an after@@ math . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of C@@ ór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the course of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of Cor@@ doba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano is not looking for his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of bearing the same name as his father , until the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; for 34 years , he kept the family secret for himself . &quot;
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that was ok . &quot;
I felt like a secret magic .

&quot; I was not able to realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ urers and murder@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gen@@ dar@@ st officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was the deputy commander of the Secret Services Division 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had seen as a boy , and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows which great power is a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . &quot;
&quot; they all called him &quot; &quot; Kent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just that they do not dec@@ eive you one day , and I must save you . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolutionary del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian revolutionary workers &quot; party . &quot;
that &apos;s why he banned me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret magic . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; then the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were turned off and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he clari@@ fied an open space and said :
&quot; as dr@@ ones , the prisoners are tor@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; I went in and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on men . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
&quot; later I found out that it was fast@@ ened to the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person , which was just tied there . &quot;
&quot; they in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ate a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water , and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eyel@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked men were lying down with the face down - all were tied at hand and feet . &quot;
&quot; close to the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw at the prisoners he said , &quot; &quot; What do you see so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
&quot; I know that &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man and killed a man . &quot;
&quot; according to the survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , was sentenced to death by the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way where the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; if you look to the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed , and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; war of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war of war &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later in the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war crimes were a bay@@ onet or perhaps military sign that one has fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothing , painting , money ... ste@@ als , it is not a war of war but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked myself how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never fall into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; And you , who st@@ ole my cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
&quot; he exploded in front of anger , sm@@ ote me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , I will find you and move you independently . &quot;
we need no one else !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo of then on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a co @-@ con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I said , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testi@@ fy .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , when I &apos;m older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one sees the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went to say so far :
&quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ? &quot;
why children do it ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with home whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even have families who could have passed away their mort@@ al remains ?
&quot; the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act , which one can do to a person . &quot;
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remn@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were grin@@ ded and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; &quot; one will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something always remains .
I have seen how you killed people !
only to clarify : I don &apos;t have anything against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie even .
&quot; I just have told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot;
the thought of showing my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly dead and asked me what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me about this ?
I have seen how you killed people !
&quot; you have committed terrible crimes , and you have forced me as a child to participate . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .

&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in the Spanish . &quot;
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial ended in August 1975 and December 1978 crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court suspended sentence sentences in 28 cases and nine cases imprisonment sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .

he pointed out the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process lasted more than three years , but the research took up 39 years . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mach@@ ch@@ af@@ ushi ( Cent@@ ara Grand Island ) ( Users Viewing this Forum : 0 )
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence , in the last month witnessed a completely mis@@ erable translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; elder mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ dos@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; means wrong@@ ly - perhaps even with evil hind@@ ran@@ ce &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible mot@@ orists . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was read from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos dealt with in the social media many times .
&quot; the error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ō@@ s . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n , published in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it be such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was removed first . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , though gramm@@ atically incorrect name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; elderly mot@@ orists &quot; ) . &quot;
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors .

&quot; we are really sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correc@@ tions ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;

&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents in the country are very cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;

translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
you need two important skills : passive voice skills in order to understand the original text and to provide active language skills to translate it into the target language .
&quot; in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate into French into French - not from French to English . &quot;

&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue , translation into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ books or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who have no foreign employees themselves , can make translations delivered in the company . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;

machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the s@@ worn and enig@@ matic pro@@ positions , which are created by mechanical translations , show that this technology cannot replace any human trans@@ lators for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the enig@@ matic prints that often decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;

&quot; translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery , or at least harm@@ less . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ laden con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an internet users announced that they would not have access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet access from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV was no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ it@@ ters carried out recordings of protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups , who opposed Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros &apos;s government . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was caught , and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages ven@@ ez@@ lli@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened to report them with fin@@ es and closures , if they would continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; appeal to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I have registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot;
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is not accessible through a locking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly passes its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique that allows the DNS servers to answer questions of specific domains . &quot;
&quot; if a web page is blocked by DNS , the server respon@@ ds def@@ ective or refuses the request when calling a such website . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third closed channel , the broadcast on Thursday , April 6 , was set up when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman Elvis Fl@@ ores , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested . &quot;
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to show . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections . &quot;

Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices courtesy of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que ca@@ en , &quot; which is processed and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the University , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as a cri@@ ad for the family . in Paraguay , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money gives their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof above the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children must pay for the countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that is within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted up . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is in@@ oc@@ ulated to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas is generally still silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , there is the family that her daughter in the belief that she will complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of herself &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes care of the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn from it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never get out of it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon that takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households is a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín was in hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent pun@@ ches . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants situated 250 km east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra proposed a stick to Mar@@ ín until it suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ ad .
organizations like UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society rooted practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;

the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers ; they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to sign up , and her father lost his job . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to go to work , and started selling swe@@ ets on the street or market in order to earn money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that it was still time to learn . &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; Friday , for example , cleaning the refrigerator , cleaned the living room , polish the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more they were finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the household as food from the refrigerator , &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the land@@ lord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and read articles from the newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o , &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to have no faith in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;

draft bill writes to Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
&quot; image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently approved a draft bill on &quot; &quot; regul@@ ating the rules concerning the use and use of social networks &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is adopted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up in order to share citizens with permission to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their right names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six paragraphs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video content and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced if it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the user registration . it is unclear how they should make those who are not able to register on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the legal situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users of the telecommunications ministry received a user name and password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to create a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyp@@ tians and Egyp@@ tians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they for@@ ci@@ bly control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a trial . &quot;
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative elections of the Parliament and the Constitutional Treaty before it comes to the plen@@ ary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that there is no different nar@@ ration on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mr. Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ kh@@ y proposed a legal situation against cyber crime in which a life sentence for those was provided for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to provo@@ ke protest . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; high above in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the northeast of Iraq , the animal rights activist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of the le@@ op@@ ards that stri@@ ves through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . in total , it is between 800 and 1000 animals , thus the International Union for Conserv@@ ation of Nature . they are endanger@@ ed due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dator in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , documented in the northeast of Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the life of those affected by the &quot; &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; &quot; in Fu@@ kus@@ hima caused disaster . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which lies in Mi@@ y@@ agi Pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ agi and the neighbouring pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had destroyed entire coastal towns from the map . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima witnessed a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows what progress has been achieved for six years to re@@ build the lives of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the japan@@ ese re@@ building authority and the survey results of those affected themselves .
&quot; the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement units ( utilities , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ an@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ agi , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there are still six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by lodging houses ( Ő@@ rség landscaped , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ an@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelter shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ agi , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ agi were more successful . more than 75 percent of ev@@ acu@@ ated ev@@ acu@@ ated , which were hau@@ led after disaster in container shel@@ ters , were moved into final houses . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ agi are now operating again , Fu@@ kus@@ hima only res@@ umed its operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have grown extensively in the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ agi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land from Fu@@ kus@@ hima are located in the &quot; &quot; nuclear pl@@ um@@ b zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered extensively , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far down . &quot;
&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal population , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; in their introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper explains : &quot;
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .

how to ev@@ acu@@ ate those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in their issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper increased their attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst catastro@@ phic @-@ causing , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; from 16@@ 0,000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 6@@ 0,000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the state of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are still living outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ ed , who are still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ burg , are older than 50 years old . they are known to be able to compete in real containers because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ agi , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima have to compete with massive construction projects . this is the building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 . &quot;

&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundred sugar cane manufacturers closed doors in Cuba ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the village Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ rho@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of its lack of sugar picking on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after the rest , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 employees had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others re@@ signed and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; it is a soldier who stands every day at 4 : 00 a.m. in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not scre@@ am his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar@@ cane factories in the east of the region , which are again in operation after a long period of time , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; it reminds me of the fact that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane mill would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry re@@ produces the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests have not yet been any news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction in the sugar cane industry was economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; they left only the factories that can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot;
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Shortage and Overeducation
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar supply crisis on the global market .
&quot; however , the sugar price increased over a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agriculture Prospects &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will come into history with certainty , &quot; that was the first words of Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the Sugar Factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the laying of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
&quot; the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repeated most , &quot; Sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order to maintain the location , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first anniversary year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; the document located at &lt; http : / / www.g@@ fb@@ v.@@ it / 2@@ c @-@ stamp@@ a / 03 @-@ 2 / 0@@ 30@@ 7@@ de@@ .html &gt; was successfully checked as XHTML 1.0 Transitional . result : passed Address : en@@ coding : utf @-@ 8 ( detect automatically ) utf @-@ 8 ( Unicode , worldwide ) &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Tor@@ o , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over , and the letters were more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the closed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane manufacturers in operation , &quot; &quot; he as@@ sures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , waits for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work of work was eradi@@ cated .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to work and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane mill was closed , or better said than they began to for@@ ti@@ fy them , they also stopped p@@ aved the road , and this dis@@ advantage is dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without the future prospects , many young people left the region again . &quot;

first Nations young@@ sters use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo taken with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do it through hip @-@ hop and thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshop leaders are bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Star . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is raising awareness that young participants in discussions on topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the territory of the Kit@@ sum@@ calyp@@ se First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West Can@@ ada , where almost two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs despite the influences of glob@@ alisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always rule the languages of the First Nations . &quot;

&quot; the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ olly from North@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in writing , as well as translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
&quot; this is the day you will hear our cry , &quot;
because we lost our way in life as youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; in this way , they can grow and proceed as well as our youth . &quot;
&quot; thus , they can do what they have determined by the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the verse in Sil@@ en@@ code ( which is also published on his blog ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic courts are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

&quot; in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , near the entrance Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; Plas@@ tic models of dishes &quot; ) are displayed by each dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic courts and decide whether they enter or pass the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic courts .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ ot@@ ers district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small businesses that produce those plastic courts , documented by the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic courts are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into striking cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the blogger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special selling : new plastic strips decorated with plastic strips as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , such as in this case , fridge magnet : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ yu fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new Boom of Essen@@ ti@@ als is becoming more complex .
&quot; in this case , a Kais@@ a @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand . &quot;
&quot; for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) , we found a good use as a cell phone stand . &quot;
&quot; this part , too , was produced for the exhibition in Tokyo Station . &quot;
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
&quot; some cell phone stands and cell phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case I@@ kur@@ a and Sal@@ mon are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic courts can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example , to surprise colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile stand has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and wrist bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more bizarre plastic courts , please see : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ om@@ blog post . or follow Twitter to Twitter to h@@ ash@@ tag # Excel &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi area dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;

a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ understand@@ ings and dis@@ appearances are only reflected in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that brings this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the con@@ greg@@ ations that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; after each body , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal pol@@ í@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; live with the drug trafficking &quot; &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who were in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime lets us not only fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers , and all municipalities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how scared lives &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Gu@@ adal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs every weekend after his son . &quot;
&quot; and Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day , lost her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task we have placed to go and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ adal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
&quot; there is also my mother , who is also here with me . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , they have no income . &quot;
&quot; you stand up the insurance of my father , but that doesn &apos;t pay them out because they demand a certificate . &quot;
&quot; where shall we come from ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the fra@@ gi@@ lity and the state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that we should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have already seen sickness and sens@@ ational journalism for a couple of years now .
I am coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures that can only be taken from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
&quot; I cannot be in@@ different , or consider this as normal . &quot;
she continues :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( german : drug traffi@@ cker ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is , as if they are sin@@ king those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories are too naked figures in a statistic .
the in@@ lessness of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified that they were &quot; ugly . &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to claim that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main town district : like a family with threats , it describes how the armed criminals had torn money from their business until they were not only destroyed by the business , but also torn apart their families . &quot;
you think about everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain is never lost , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes again high when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
they concluded their report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the response is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he himself had to teach himself how to cook an egg , br@@ oth potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every age of life .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes , un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the life of violence , and he had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years earlier , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the number of mur@@ ders for public security and government of the United States government . &quot;

these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines . but this project reminds us of those we can &apos;t forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ hr@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 has launched the data journ@@ alistic project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades in a clear way . &quot;

the fact @-@ check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a counter@@ f@@ eit .
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time appeared ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false dec@@ ou@@ pling of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank wagon crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and exploded . 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank wagon fell to the victim . &quot;
&quot; the government representatives described a fire@@ ball , wrapped up dozens of houses including a cinem@@ as nearby , which was full of people watching the football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture of the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur User My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple photographs of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of cau@@ tious bodies , which are ri@@ pen@@ ed on the ground while individuals look at them . &quot;
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were laid in streets and b@@ ushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; a population of Human Rights Watch said . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burnt . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the occasion for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here , the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , as it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a cover for mass@@ acres . &quot;
&quot; even one step further , personal comments like this example wrong@@ ly fal@@ si@@ fy the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning message , those who fled to the United Nations describe those who were fle@@ eing b@@ lows , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts appeared as the following to summari@@ ze these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to portra@@ y this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not taken the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false data
traces of these false dec@@ ays reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere around the world .
&quot; using a &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how far more information can exceed limits . &quot;
&quot; a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has been found under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images , which are very similar to the dar@@ ing picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private sites , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed wrong reports , others have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have incorporated examples of abu@@ sive use and associated with the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been linked together ) , several examples can be used for abu@@ sive use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; Pater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the picture was included from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ inian mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of er@@ ron@@ eous use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye can also be tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamps exist on the web craw@@ ler and they have some picture file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original piece of 2010 , the picture may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and Images
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph has been used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the hei@@ ghtening of Christians through Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the destruction of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe these images longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are sixty people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
&quot; the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example , for example ) . &quot;
&quot; one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern that violent images of readers and spectators are des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ zing and their ability to perceive emp@@ athy ( such as this study which investigates how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss with non @-@ violent depic@@ tions in the news media , it is fact that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will have to think about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which actually can be used from context or completely ab@@ uses . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

&quot; a blog containing the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or impossible to translate . &quot;
&quot; such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but everyone resi@@ sts stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly to attempt a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog , you can find words from the Ta@@ w@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Test your parents in recognition of how your younger years have tried . &quot;
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; - The comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days . &quot;
in Birds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; you remove other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages , &quot; which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite destinations here . &quot;

Sri Lanka &apos;s worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ds of floo@@ ds and earthqu@@ akes in this decade .
&quot; caused by the mon@@ soon , who normally uses the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have joined the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement from Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people were missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were given up to 304 safe places . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly back . &quot;
health and hygiene standards represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :

&quot; as a result , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; button that resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue actions by floo@@ ding floo@@ ds and land@@ slides . &quot;

use approved t.@@ dam in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she trust me her children , she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we shout slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next channel , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umb@@ rel@@ las and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other gu@@ inea slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslim &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they dis@@ agree with me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is designed in our collective imagination so well that as soon as Muslims , as I don &apos;t fit there , are ent@@ om@@ inated . &quot;
to be ab@@ om@@ inated
I don &apos;t stand alone .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what pictures do you think of it when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , the religion Rum@@ i was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ ized by Western books for centuries . &quot;
this entic@@ ing picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ assembled the story behind these images . &quot;
but these pictures still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them . &quot;
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how this powerful and fla@@ wed Nar@@ rative dominate our news@@ feeds .
&quot; this nar@@ ra@@ tives over@@ shadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the past three decades , while the US did not even choose their first female Presi@@ dential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ ra@@ tively fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scarf in public buildings , Saudi women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ ra@@ tively weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
&quot; it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ cans , who had been brought hi@@ ther@@ to with slave ships . &quot;
it cle@@ ars the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this nar@@ ra@@ tives has made our collective imagination so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children are the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and attacks . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we are doing more than just stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ ra@@ tives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the Nar@@ ra@@ tives of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;

&quot; when Khan was re @-@ thinking the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now lying in the Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; from respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I hear , we do not carry all hand@@ bags with us . &quot;
we must also not be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the running tape from a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who is tear@@ ing the head@@ scarf from a woman . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Muslim , but a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , see my rock in the fire that I am Muslims when they look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the everyday ritual with my daughter , when I wi@@ ther it in my arms , and whis@@ per the Arabic verses to protect the Qur &apos;an and to be called Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
I repeat each of them three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the picture of my grandmother mat@@ ernal with her sisters ; how she won a competition of the art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi a few decades ago .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I can see in this moment when I close my eyes : n@@ ano , surrounded by their complete and incomplete paintings of the Su@@ fi saint ; and a Koran with a lot of book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters that it can almost turn out . &quot;
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers she had told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims there is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that has been colon@@ ized by an &quot; &quot; empire &quot; &quot; which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien companies , it has a deep meaning to call my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
it means knowing that the first fly @-@ bomb of history was dropped over a century ago by a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he conducted the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops station@@ ed across every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica , had gone into Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
&quot; to be an American Muslim , it means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy strikes the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , history has been reported for four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ a@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by liber@@ ated black slaves . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; to be an American , a Pakistani woman , a Kash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate to others . &quot;
&quot; the nar@@ ra@@ tives of the 1.7 billion have more possibilities than a magic cube , but is depicted in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to take care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people on this ambig@@ u@@ ity build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists in the Muslim registri@@ es , which started with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officers who take a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just countries that are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which is largely based on Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars we carry and the bombs , which we throw away on Muslim lands . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scienti@@ fic@@ ally correct picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we Need to Lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the def@@ ective and dangerous bil@@ ingual prints that we are ste@@ aling in our news@@ groups . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the pod@@ cast lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increasingly print out Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pakistani , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
&quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years before , it had not yet been given them ; now they control large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me an un@@ converted Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a bread crum@@ ble in my speech .

&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are brought to us and enth@@ ron@@ ed people by creating the &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; in the public imagination , four decades ago even scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions , according to the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously committed the &quot; others &quot; ; as it is my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation is that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already has broken down countries and &quot; to others &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

can there be a way to connect here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone ?

firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages do not pass on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass ext@@ inction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , accept diversity , secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening to it often , &quot; these events are rather &quot; listening to feeling , to make sense . &quot; &quot;
enter multiple addresses separated by commas and / or different lines .
&quot; even if the participants are not professional story@@ t@@ ellers , their dedication and representation will lead to the audience &apos;s audience . &quot;
&quot; they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; for example , the following video shows a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ nor@@ ara tells the f@@ ables from Has@@ en and P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after he declar@@ es the meaning of his f@@ abel , John Ny@@ nor@@ ara will be asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide grin , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you listened !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own story@@ telling . &quot;

it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ vic front for the ne@@ ural testing of debt ) and the E@@ com@@ en@@ ical church assembly Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ affir@@ ming the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people Puerto Ric@@ os call that politicians , banks and government officials responsible for debt are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial review and a committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding to the benefit of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a debt which is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not integrated in the state of the US - suff@@ ers under a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; proposes a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law to state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , there is a risk of running away from the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; Nacht@@ wache for Light and Truth . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture that is held in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bas@@ el campaign . &quot;

&quot; the book , published last year and available here , contains a series of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is said : &quot;
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge , and what is the real cost of which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for Free Knowledge have worked on page to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create a sense of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet @-@ volunteers , which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled &quot; &quot; Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own fate , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convic@@ tions ?

&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; was based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi told her that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ rew , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently passing the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps there was none of Bas@@ eball &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes than the work , which he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of many civili@@ zations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , em@@ body these architecture that is not only em@@ bodies the cultural legacy of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip in digital arch@@ e@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public , as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , sharing his knowledge with others even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my whole life with dreaming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el brought me English , even when he was already in jail . &quot;
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other subjects to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners , how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ s@@ thetic , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in detention . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .

Bash@@ ar &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; since 2011 , according to the International Human Rights Organization , Amnesty International died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .

&quot; Moz@@ cans re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose advice to Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on April 19th . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic , which made the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not carry any disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not well aware of the action . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution that advoc@@ ates public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have led a disciplinary approach against the def@@ endant .
&quot; the company was apparently silent , however , and promp@@ ted no adequate legal action for the application of appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Moz@@ arab@@ ian social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; reluct@@ ant &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent guy , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been cut off . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent he has agreed to re@@ integrate into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ kan@@ ger and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not have any mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he ins@@ ult@@ ed him , I cannot believe that one has been rewarded for such a way that has already mas@@ sively ins@@ ult@@ ed the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing mor@@ als and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served only himself by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state to handle an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man has been so rewar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only as the first independent president in memory , but also as sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was capable , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely slo@@ ping con@@ not@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism today , but the word in itself does not automatically provo@@ ke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important and # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use , have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with fundamental meanings that have the same character as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is also written on Bur@@ mes@@ an &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ age b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar En@@ am@@ els &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kers A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a spiritual manner , whether they knew how to alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a word@@ play . &quot;
the sentence ku la - &quot; C@@ ure &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .

it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words .
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( sp@@ age b@@ ushes ) . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ise their nationalism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not be long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of headlines often is a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternate spelling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
&quot; when I was atten@@ tive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post from Facebook was removed and I was prohibited from the lights , posts and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; Facebook community standards did not meet standards . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
these words to cens@@ or will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would make them a big turnover , it would be great . &quot;

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law to ban this practice so that the hei@@ r @-@ able age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ personal ad Mahar@@ aj , Chief of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened , ir@@ respective of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contrac@@ ting partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors of the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children born in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that in 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at creating laws for inf@@ ants , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring this result . &quot;
&quot; however , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say the critics of the pra@@ ises that they should , who are condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point , doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill was decided against the child before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree and declare the law .

&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and no one voted against it . &quot;

&quot; although Turkey has blocked articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 have been adopted since 2007 after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; in China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world , when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to remain closed , several M@@ irr@@ or@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) are di@@ pped . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform installed all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine calcul@@ ators ) , which does not support the domain name system and makes a complete c@@ ensu@@ s difficult . &quot;
&quot; in spite of legal prohibition , the content is irre@@ voc@@ able . &quot;
IP@@ FS reports about his efforts in a blog post :
&quot; after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about blocking Wikipedia ) , we used everything to cover snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the content on de@@ centralized and distributed way is possible . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wiki@@ pedi@@ a.org . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member , as well as collabor@@ ators with Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast : &quot;
&quot; there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; 2 : 39 PM , Jan 29th , 2014 via Twitter for Mac in reply to 34@@ 3@@ max &quot;
&quot; in essence , the server forwar@@ ded the request to the right Wikipedia site so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves , if they are closed in Turkey . &quot;
this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for wildlife protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around , never satisfied . &quot;
the motiv@@ ate him to wear a camera and try to bury the situation .
&quot; at that time , he was still a child . &quot;
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar endeav@@ ours to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it is the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class position helps in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . &quot;
&quot; he had a call from my father , that a le@@ op@@ ard would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of Rap@@ ti River . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; immediately I ran away with my camera , and was there in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar aims to co @-@ operate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal and wants to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood by face to face from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b himself from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home when suddenly the king of Bu@@ chi@@ k appeared . he immediately sets out , we see , and he star@@ es at me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for promoting Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern@@ es in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near tourist accommodation . &quot;
see below some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the marriage , Indian women dare to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands &quot;

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ aa@@ z K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version has been published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care of addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that they should respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseu@@ do @-@ law and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives is also common among men . however , they have far fewer references to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel as well as house@@ wives , came to a unique club and thus became the main theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place only for them alone , in which they discuss and discuss the fin@@ esse of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ war has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s hei@@ r to exile from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and heads these clubs . &quot;
she reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini presented in her discussion group , acted by women who did not call her hus@@ bands name . &quot;
&quot; she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem , with which women can easily identify themselves . &quot;
&quot; the name of their hus@@ bands does not speak lou@@ dly , is a Br@@ auch that they all owe to all obligations and never questioned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of any thoughts about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband , wanted to try at home as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was finished .
&quot; practice , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ e S@@ RE@@ MM@@ UR@@ D &#124; Special Guests : Bob@@ o SW@@ AE , IMP@@ X@@ CT Ab 19.00 until 23.@@ 00 &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , means that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women never speak the name of her hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
a woman was so shy that she kis@@ sed her during the whole exercise ; another decided to allow the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; even in the adren@@ alin rush of breaking with an ancient bre@@ wing , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home their hus@@ bands name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it in front of the entire family .
&quot; as her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed , she got scared and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was done in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ ch red dot on the foreh@@ ead that shows the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the cin@@ ch @-@ red point if he did it . &quot;
&quot; he laugh@@ ed only , and I heard it to bear him . &quot;
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely , but they think they are now in a better position , even to choose not to wear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear something , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is associated with the clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most , it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt about a pants , wear ; they did not dare . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothes , mor@@ als combined with sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini found her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to do it . &quot;
&quot; the question is whether in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly moving into the roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped telling the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do not make it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two men continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ ead .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the cli@@ ff for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a hard @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
every one of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

December : 1 items &#124; November : 1 items &#124; October : 4 items &#124; June : 1 items &#124; April : 1 items &#124;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of smo@@ other people for organ trafficking , probably for dis@@ believing purposes , worried the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the Mil@@ ange area , a few kilometres from Mal@@ awi border . &quot;
one of the victims has been de@@ capit@@ ated and a part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently used to be used by the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi .
&quot; according to the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald @-@ headed man could bring gold or wealth , the police spokesperson of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia said the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on gl@@ are @-@ headed men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of accompli@@ sh@@ ments for ob@@ ses@@ sive purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN Security Council adopted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government has developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be Wey@@ a lives in the city of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique in Moz@@ ambique are target of ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambique police warned of the latest kill@@ ings of three gl@@ amor@@ ous men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two suspects were arrested in the Mil@@ ky district , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ adult Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police had already gone after the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the smooth @-@ headed men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of gl@@ amor@@ ous individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the area of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also acknow@@ le@@ dges that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha announced on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blog@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who pointed out that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Moz@@ ambique faces : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , THE S@@ ICH is ash@@ amed A country where people would like to go to the street , to demand sex with good marks , work and other performances , a nation in which people would be ash@@ amed to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for dis@@ believing purposes or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; would be hun@@ ted to get to fast riches . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not escape the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ eted that both the head of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , as well as the police spokesman Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are both silent : &quot;

a photo of Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which was probably made recently .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to the international community , after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has described Li@@ us as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and says a spokesman , he said it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to permit a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out of the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press summari@@ zed some reactions from abroad .
United Nations ( United Nations )
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokesman declined to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot;
Norway ( EN )
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , since exports have largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
current directory : / english / BS@@ 1 :
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplomatic of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she announced on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift all restrictions on Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA ( 1 )
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told the Americans that he had the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he would assist him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the Embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;

&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but police always watched the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says further :

&quot; in a statement on 29 June , France &apos;s Foreign Ministry invited China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where needed . furthermore , his wife and his family should contact him . &quot;
&quot; although the news agency France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information on whether France will ultimately receive it . &quot;

&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dal@@ ai Lama , showed himself very worried about Li@@ u on June 28 , indicating that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for whom he had been severely punished , had led to a more harmon@@ ious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt very moved personally and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and people affected were inspired by Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem foo@@ lish because Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blog osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he under@@ lined that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one asked if New York was a democracy ...
this is where most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; turning the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercising of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , one can say that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from responsibilities , a compulsory violation . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , he seemed un@@ democra@@ tically un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the main point of the subject , the good old gro@@ ans emerge from the author@@ itarian rulers who pret@@ end to be demo@@ crats , leaving the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the answers to his American guests were given answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our Judi@@ cial , our political system . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , there is no need for such questions . &quot;
Rachel Z@@ eng challenged Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it is a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the Government of Singapore .

read the manuscript .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equally important , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , who is as leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am about what the minister of Justice said of Singapore , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what a@@ waits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he is really , and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ covers the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am &apos;s arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am committed a mistake ? or was it a Fre@@ ud Spe@@ akers ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the Cabinet &apos;s Cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am &apos;s statements are of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singap@@ or@@ ean do their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who needs to pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink personnel policy ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ded to announce , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a town / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defence of the country , &quot; etc . , but this is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; global Vo@@ ices , recently , asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your hom@@ etown or home country ? &quot;
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , revealing the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and to be shown a different fac@@ et . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; in my clari@@ fication the standard answer is mostly follows : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in anger when they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans give a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when travelling .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion in Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans always wore small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons in us !
same @-@ sex mar@@ riages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are poli@@ te .
we seem to say very often &quot; excuse . &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups as the most toler@@ ant country .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I admi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t make me think , for example , to switch to Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : to be called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; basically means to be di@@ lig@@ ent - like the good @-@ minded , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one own Canadian bi@@ ker ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is one of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence along the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friend@@ liness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada virtually sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dic@@ ted Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop band has released a music video showing the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and re @-@ establish the civil government despite their promises to restore the civil government . &quot;
IPTC : caption Billy Talent live at the Greenfield Festival in Interlaken ( Switzerland ) on June 13th 2009 . IPTC : Copyright Notice Copyright by Shelley Jambresic .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the ongoing military domin@@ ance of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to view this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; look at these videos of the videos , which are related to some of the political topics that have per@@ sist@@ ently followed Thailand over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may be given to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provis@@ ional constitution , which gives the supreme decision making authority over important national subjects . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; setting up &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are seen by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , monitored online content and accused persons accused of having committed the mon@@ archy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand relies on a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ an@@ ts@@ off@@ ense ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , even though security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax profits . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and internet users will face long prison sentences , they should ins@@ ult the mon@@ archy . &quot;

life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in Eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ry Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ random war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern subur@@ bs in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ at@@ ava are located in the basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ sch @-@ Asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked for Soviet sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest portion of Russians and ab@@ c@@ ents live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , having barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 4,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

he begins a conversation and it &apos;s hard to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community . &quot;
now there is only p@@ aved road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived at this place and made their contribution to the central administration of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty people live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still accommodate one or two families , one recognizes the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;

the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez conduc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border from Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula . it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
&quot; it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ ene frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
&quot; she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
&quot; in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage . &quot;
there is no sign for the hotel - even hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast , they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you in M@@ om Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have slept on boxes outside . &quot;
you don &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
&quot; she helps them and brings them to hospital if they are ill , she bu@@ ys medicines they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ ages them with a bal@@ m that is exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived shortly before . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; with his sister , Sebas@@ ti@@ ao hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil already in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to normally take a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans are often travelling along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months now : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests send her often text messages , when they are gone to gr@@ ind her or report her about the course of her journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark hoping for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants too expensive .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users Recommend Recommend
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , ethnic minorities in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the cell phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which they indicated the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
but k@@ ò@@ n@@ th@@ ens the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police state that the app was investigating and prosec@@ uting the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protected service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; the main feature is blocking porno@@ graphic websites , online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal from it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and the South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict regions , authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures , as well as routine internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership Apple iPhone 7 : inklusive Top @-@ Tari@@ f noch besser
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be imprisoned up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity by the rest of the world .
we are back in Ma@@ o China again .
&quot; images from &quot; China &quot; ( 中@@ 文 ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can raise the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus receive un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard disk . &quot;
&quot; after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones become electronic hand@@ hel@@ ds in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council , to minimize the spread of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and the party connected to the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber@@ security office during operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi &apos;s regional capital , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ish@@ ments for a whole number of other possible distor@@ tions , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; , &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at you and realize that you are completely alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually resolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes her name all the glory .
one that has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when reality brings you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond acting , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings out of flesh and blood , and everything revol@@ ves after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth is on the axis of the evil . you realize that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough so that I &quot; &quot; my lesson learned &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the Security Service expressed it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; he put his power over us , even destroying the simpl@@ est concepts we knew . &quot;
five young people were torn apart during a peaceful protest like weed from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; all the districts were cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is stuff@@ ed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things got a bit so@@ othing after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood . &quot;
I interrupted the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice contra@@ di@@ ted by silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt bold enough to find together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we were allied with a glorious picture that filled my expectations completely and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but you just don &apos;t care in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice , after you have cried out all the way to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear how you shout &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry if we are not near . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and you don &apos;t trust me to look at me and not on the ground !
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , van@@ ity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure , when I replied , &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you &apos;ve already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped seeing you in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I didn &apos;t regret what I said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father equ@@ als with him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed stat@@ ute lies in me to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a psychological torture , which I was subjected to months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I wear with me . &quot;
&quot; once again , through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the individual cells . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if She@@ y@@ la is on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more det@@ ain@@ ee , and must immediately put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I returned to an old @-@ tried communication method : to beat the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; &quot; first @-@ fly &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a rep@@ utable man of middle age , which is similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there are no significant visual references to me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to me ?
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ators had assured me , they would release him if I stay . &quot;
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws that lab@@ oured to the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the cry , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interrog@@ ated .
&quot; this was the secret : to protect the state security from us and to prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itors and terrorists , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ list and betra@@ yed the narrow viewpoint of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ t@@ orium and meet them in Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and strong man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the face expressions that der@@ ailed him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to protest this day and protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end anyway . &quot;
I did not answer .

I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said I had to get used to being punished , although I had nothing to make this sentence . &quot;

his command is to tear myself as much flesh as possible from the body .

&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold your cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough , why they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a g@@ arbage collector , or if it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ated each other to present us , from their point of view , to present a great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them changed from them , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice , why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling , and didn &apos;t find any pleasure , which is why he attacked an electri@@ cally charged bar . &quot;

&quot; after two horrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night . &quot;
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again . let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which came to me as a minute . &quot;
&quot; then , the call to the morning prayer . &quot;
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , as@@ sh@@ ole . &quot;

&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sh@@ uts on his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again on his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has been one of them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West@@ bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib has been a passionate activist for six years , confron@@ ting the conservative majority and questioned its well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often discusses topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also asks the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ ib has seen himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind and he can sympath@@ ize with people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he doesn &apos;t openly admit it openly , he has a special reluct@@ ance against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ ib sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones can do anything with his identity as &quot; &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation . &quot; &quot; he himself describes himself , even when he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own life circumstances , &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes H@@ da@@ ib . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think , because I am a person , &quot; while he dissolved in water , N@@ esc@@ af@@ é poured into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the slu@@ dge of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of Kent c@@ ig@@ ars in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if one thro@@ ws a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it simply avo@@ ids to do basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan water - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Interior Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MEPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert tab@@ ern@@ acle . &quot;
&quot; the members and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert was &quot; &quot; straight &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which in@@ quire the proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to advocate for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement should not be simply sil@@ ky rhet@@ oric , but in fact an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib returned traditional sex @-@ trees to Lei@@ be by aboli@@ shing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have been pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently low @-@ worn unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the inn@@ um@@ erable women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; &quot; honor@@ ary mor@@ als &quot; &quot; - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , Jord@@ anian is still lacking institutional infrastructure in order to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence in appropriate ways . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime control from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can often be held at un@@ specified time , and for their release , a long @-@ lasting bureaucratic effort and the guarantee provided by the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well known to shy away from issues that have long been regarded as tab@@ u in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib has denied that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he is not able to separate his music , the full explicit acts of sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I became politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ ib accepts the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ ar@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;

&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse repeatedly repe@@ ats itself : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and each other is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib was an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to note that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ ib is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not apply to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ova , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ ova could work on behalf of the cali@@ ph in eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , such as H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being put to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service arrested several former government members and members of the teacher &apos;s association with the reason that they could have critically critic@@ ised the problems that were deeply rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s concert is just the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant aging and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is how it sees H@@ da@@ ib - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ ib , like millions of other Arabs , dre@@ amed of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of how to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is approaching with music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , uni@@ forms and artificial kind of democra@@ cies . at least , he hopes that . &quot;

&quot; there are rarely outer appearances and body care as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ bers and illegal drug shops are common@@ place every day . &quot;
&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing an increasing demand for men &apos;s aesthetic services . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led that more and more regular citizens enter into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &apos; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &apos; , which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts oppose each other to show who can create the most ex@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to share their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers and to receive a training in hair@@ dressing , which enables them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of its successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of , because of love for children we have built this educational community . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; Love messages on guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , &quot; which publi@@ shes the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel dis@@ cour@@ aged , aff@@ ection aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; just this question , the two young Colom@@ bian activists , Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os Foundation , did not get out of the head and inspired them to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aci@@ ón campaign ( letters to reconciliation ) , who encouraged young people to write letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was a scene of historical events and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla force F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signat@@ ory of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and around the clock had to integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , has become acc@@ ustom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeply hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , they must now take part in their ranks and support them in establishing a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and to help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter , who will then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letter to reconciliation was taken on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á , where Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s day , but those who need much more need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent need . &quot;
&quot; this was the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former comb@@ at@@ ants of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC were so on how they had done it earlier in order to counter@@ act the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; told the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of Valle del Cau@@ ca Province , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former comb@@ at@@ ant led me to the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of refuge in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go into , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ gren@@ ade laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the thorn bush . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer to a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I said to it . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ g@@ ged him , and sat beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was tired of war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life as a war . &quot; &quot; the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before the fam@@ ine . &quot; &quot; I never thought that anyone would be for@@ given to me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices .
&quot; for the first time , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were together with a discussion group . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how social injustice helped the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who had never heard hearing and had no electoral right , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated people who were turned around by their lives and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ts me that all men - even those who have killed and have done so much damage , can bring us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ ans proph@@ es@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to attack and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as a basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; gay and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that is related to the LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only about night .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; several months ago , the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over the international headlines when reports were published that themati@@ zed the delay , torture and killing of qu@@ eer women in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta . she threw a light on the methods of Ch@@ echn@@ ya authorities who arrested more susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced of the sexual assault of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the United States . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On May 27 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ est the family , you che@@ ek ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that it was a young man , no thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing . &quot;
OC Media : what ail@@ ments were you laid in - in men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time on his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was only bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have body size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother was too much , and she put a rope around her neck . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them . &quot;
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved into a flat and a few hours later under the window a car with dim windows and a num@@ ber@@ plate with a 95 on it .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something lazy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something unexpected happened . &quot;
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering for me , without ID , without anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
came to and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you do not believe that you are in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
our people already know what hotel you are hiding . they even know your room number .
only to prove it : it &apos;s the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still contact your family with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about sexual inter@@ ruption , this is a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot;
&quot; some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements , I still wear in me . &quot;
&quot; so much I wish , this spiritual barrier I cannot overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give myself a lot of effort to look like the person that she recalls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week .
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked with someone who had sc@@ anned in Ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of the Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not unlock a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end ask a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has been experienced by blood . &quot;
OC Media : are men now detained in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend told me that there was just not many .
&quot; if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been left by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can present them as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; Should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but inten@@ tionally immer@@ sed in order to radic@@ alise . &quot;
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself , when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would it not have been allowed to sh@@ ave these people ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
&quot; in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob . &quot;
I think I was already known before 2003 when I was living there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; , &quot; but in the end it was thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot;
administrator : Q &amp; A on Twitter ( sum@@ mar@@ ised and edited ) Q1 : I think these planes mentioned in the article are ...
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had painted lashes , wore tubes jeans and short tops . &quot;
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria never bow@@ ed to me only a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where each evening , especially at weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and all the city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ ma ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they often say to children , when they make fun of the sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so , they just closed their eyes before you , because they believed they were ill ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period lasted ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could sense how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; he who had gel@@ ded and laugh@@ ed before , gaz@@ ed at you at once with suspicion . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic was steadily worse . &quot;
OC Media : what kind of activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ iter .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
&quot; in addition , I am still active as a activist . &quot;
ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 4 ( North European ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 5 ( Cyrillic ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 6 @-@ i ( Arabic )
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get tickets . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a c@@ ents for a long time .
I have discovered these people myself when I dis@@ ap@@ point the flu@@ ori@@ de sor@@ es .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear an Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to proph@@ esy with foam in front of your mouth , that there are no co@@ ils with them . &quot;
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the cab@@ in@@ ers who have the Russians too ; on the whole planet there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practi@@ sing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast@@ ing during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think at transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that you change his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a problem . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body . &quot;
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
&quot; for the past few months , there has been a strong rise of suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , is ramp@@ ant . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ash@@ amed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to be able to pay the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups , who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to delete the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists warn against the fact that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month saw some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless in persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , which is a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran , has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi mon@@ archy took over power and took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime has denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically work places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water of the Arab regions in the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm @-@ industry industries . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi people rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % secondary school and 45 % have university degrees . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Big@@ 5 ( Chinese , traditional ) Big@@ 5 @-@ H@@ K@@ SC@@ S ( Chinese , Hong Kong ) tis @-@ 620 ( Thai ) ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ r ( Russian ) ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ u ( Ukrainian ) iso @-@ ir @-@ 111 ( Cyrillic KO@@ I @-@ 8 ) &quot;
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
&quot; because function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ih@@ oods outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace , let the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to end@@ ure , human rights activists strike alert before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avo@@ idable .

the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a feminist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ through scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ists .
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men nowadays despite the same education . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women have come sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still spreading across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer twice and triple among them . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I come to the skin colour , on racism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community , or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I speak out what kind of we are physically , mentally and verb@@ ally ab@@ used , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ists have to be silent . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift their voices and sing &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other ethni@@ cities and generations make less earning than white men and women .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of being exposed to domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men and all men of all skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injustice in her mind , who refuses to refer to the sex as well as the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women and has always rejected me .
&quot; so@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ mented and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings that are also absorbed by cultural appropri@@ ation our customs and customs to advance their self @-@ centered program .
&quot; for some of them will continue to remain silent for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different income a home and to cut off from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of putting myself into a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women after our own ideas and go into the spheres that will be created by us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ iming _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither exagger@@ ated nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine devoted to international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; Nabil Mus@@ a repeatedly traveled over the past 7 years , mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of their work is on tra@@ ced , little resp@@ ectable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories their way . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ ts . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ less @-@ consuming ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner , who had become violent to her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time has passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for abuse , the acc@@ ustom@@ ed ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was not useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second wife with@@ drew her ad . &quot;
to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women make an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also finan@@ cially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; ( to create paragraphs , you simply leave blank lines . ) &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really ill @-@ treated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are alarm@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 adverti@@ sements for domestic violence in the District Attorney Office . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 adverti@@ sements because of domestic violence among the peac@@ ebu@@ il@@ ders . here , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the adverti@@ sements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true dimension of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this will come to each woman who will not do this , &quot; she explained in the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , law enforcement authorities cannot document how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners . &quot;

&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want it , but gave it to me . this should always regret it . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but for two years she carried the psych@@ ic power on her part - one of the most common forms of violence against women , and at the same time the most recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I never thought that I would once again become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ servi@@ ent because they can be fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against it and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Yo te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Vict@@ ori@@ as , everything began with psychological abuse . &quot;
her wealthy partner ultimately managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as adverti@@ sements in the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; she conducted a trial against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable legal battle between Paraguay and her native country where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;

&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good but cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Women &apos;s Organization for Women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in the use of laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non One Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International .
&quot; the original draft of the law fores@@ ees , to explain fem@@ icide , to an independent criminal off@@ ence and pun@@ ish the har@@ sh@@ est as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the law text has been changed in some respects to attract the members of the law , who feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions is banned , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had planned , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) travel costs , which have to bear the victims of violence at present , if they just want to pay an advertisement and want to receive a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;

&quot; here , a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer seen as something normal . &quot;
&quot; in view of these facts , the perpet@@ rators are guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rators are punished . &quot;
we have to pay as long as abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law have been changed . among other things , a passage has been painted , which the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
notify me of follow @-@ up comments by email . notify me of new posts by email .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victims again .
&quot; the phrase &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is considered a big set@@ back . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision of the information minister &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the Cuban authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the newspaper editors , is still in prison , where he served a year @-@ old prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried before the Court , but later came free again . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ibn S@@ aid , who came to power after having made his father , S@@ aid ibn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at . &quot;
&quot; since then , he has been cloth@@ ed alongside his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important mini@@ stries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , supreme commander of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , President of the Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the sult@@ an is marked by the per@@ sever@@ ing efforts of security forces , especially the state secret service , public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including freedom of press , restra@@ int and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blogger and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights , including activists , to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closing and imprisonment three of its editors in the last year , is a hard blow to freedom of press in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , was arrested in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the ruling of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial board , was charged with the special department and arrested on his arrival of security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS hosted the editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at un@@ specified time after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the paper on any way , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ kat was the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the court sentenced three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned , among other things , due to distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining of the state of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a public ban and s@@ lander . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es amoun@@ ting to 3,000 om@@ bian ri@@ al ( 78@@ 00 US dollars ) . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 2,@@ 600 US dollars ) after he was the use of &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit amoun@@ ting to 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgement of the sentence . &quot;

&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information provided an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture is done with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . this is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site : firstly , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the offer of the global healthcare system that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for the Research of Inf@@ ectious Disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ ren discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier is speaking as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I am launching a research programme for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
GV : what do you think of the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recipient instead of being makers themselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;

is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure is not equal to standards in developed countries . it costs lots of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there are already a lot of interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic education , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this . &quot;
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that perio@@ dic@@ als can only make available against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from US to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production

Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salad since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sal@@ at@@ as he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents are not only used for single varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or angled leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ on types . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts in food security are concerned about the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mort@@ on still breeding salad , he needs a longer time since his work becomes more difficult and more difficult . &quot;

&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents on salads are too far away . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new let@@ tu@@ ce because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eders ) . &quot;

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot;
&quot; it was called into the life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , so that plant bre@@ eders can be used permanently . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , shortly called O@@ SSI , U.S. bre@@ eders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to breed their seeds , to breed their own varieties , and it is not immediately available - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons . &quot;
&quot; since its launch in 2014 , dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 . &quot;
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Madison and O@@ SSI board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seed and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed money plays a role in greater co@@ hes@@ ion such as bi@@ odiversity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to helping others to keep their seeds free , as opposed to pat@@ enting seed and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is endanger@@ ed because the available gene pool due to the ever @-@ increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available , un@@ ce@@ asingly shr@@ inking . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ SSI , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are not such estimates yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that massive cultivated plants like wheat are patented as a salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a Matter of Vis@@ i@@ bility
&quot; plants are so bred that they have specifically engineered characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improves to such , because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and keep threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; against this background , papers focusing on reasons for , or on results or measurement of such matching problems are particularly welcome . call for Papers 12th IWH / IAB @-@ Workshop on Labour Market Policies Online Survey of the IAB web presence &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto noted that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts that intellectual property holds other bre@@ eders as &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expi@@ res . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same outcome with another method .
&quot; such protection does not in@@ hi@@ bit innovations , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent expi@@ res , certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants that are adapted to the altered environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general well and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; &quot; we do not create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves , and as a bre@@ eder , we have no idea how the plants do this . &quot;
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eders in the US state Oregon and O@@ SSI board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; if you breed a variety , you also breed its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are needed for their cultivation of mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly gent@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , most small seed companies can also survive without patents - either reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; in addition , Mort@@ on is convinced that bre@@ eders would be more innovative to avoid plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than the company that patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent one is protected from competition for 20 years , with which one can simply make it easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the USA seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source , &quot; the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col works on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SSI commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for bre@@ eders vary from country to country , where the O@@ SSI obligation cannot be taken over to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it appeals against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conventional cultivated plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch Organisation of Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organisation is currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , planned for the planned next year of the official launch . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development assistance groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - action group on ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has put together a database on seed and bi@@ odiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a context , from the Lu@@ by of O@@ SSI hopes that it will soon become more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly paid attention to where and how it is grown , and seeds systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that even more behind their food is . &quot;

&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;

&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 06@@ th August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet service providers ( IS@@ Ps ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Eti@@ let@@ at . &quot;

&quot; on Monday , June 12 we noticed how blocking websites that offer V@@ PN@@ s began . &quot;
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that could have access to Egyptian users .
&quot; in addition , the situation is exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed against these actions . &quot;

&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are common@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not normal in which they announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper thus explained the motives for their decision :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any big city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sexual inter@@ ruption , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; War in Rio &quot; section . ( ... ) This is our way to call : that &apos;s not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not exclu@@ de our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that won &apos;t recognise the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the Editorial Board , the newspaper continues : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to dec@@ eive the atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it does ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra argues against the violence as &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ sufficient negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; in memory of the state of Rio de Janeiro , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie down according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .

&quot; this security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by employing a massive police force and permanently station@@ ing a unit . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux added one of his articles from 2010 in which he explained why the violence in Rio did not correspond to the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of situation in Rio as war also attracts serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical for a war . this includes entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a gyp@@ sy is an invisible point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot; &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib about a million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the region east Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the UN and other human rights organizations , that the massacre of the Assad regime was ex@@ er@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these controlled areas have been under siege from Damascus , which led to the fact that residents are dependent on local or through tunnels and control points of smug@@ gled food . &quot;
&quot; through years of block@@ ade , traditional food products such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the conventional ones planted in Syria , and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ tor@@ ate of the Project , Ab@@ o Nabil , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and wa@@ it@@ ers . &quot;

the initiative is dependent on gener@@ ators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels made of plastic are used to supply the gener@@ ators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small fung@@ al farm in a tub . as this did , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : rup@@ ture of siege . &quot;

&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege will be visible . &quot;

&quot; according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors forest areas by satellite photography , around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon area . &quot;
so you can make a better picture of Ernst &apos;s situation : there is only one fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread across the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the Trage@@ dy of Ham@@ let - Prince of Denmark
the aim of the Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people wondered why the civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the form of wood , which the government had brought into grave fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected to the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; this was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues on the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us carefully made aware that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread after fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; to these problems , the website of the Civil Protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when residents sought information or tried to contact their relatives , was offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that provided the population with information , using the f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt application and informed the population in real @-@ time about the location and spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial that the server encountered the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who persec@@ uted the fires : the website counted more than half a million . &quot;

&quot; in a night in the fall of 1994 , the con@@ quest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war had broken between the various Mu@@ jah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it back then , she knew she couldn &apos;t see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was to break . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt hel@@ pless . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan again . &quot;
&quot; a few years later , he worked in a coal pit . the work was hard and he made him sick . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left from his little wage , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and drag@@ ged s@@ acks with mortar , which were heavier than he himself , to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked . &quot;
&quot; there were no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon off the open windows , so that we could not fro@@ ze at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice the day eating to help need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for far@@ sigh@@ ted asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high growth rates . however , it is true that the conditions of asylum seek@@ ers in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres &quot; in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially issued an application for asylum - what can be done for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ e@@ af .
but his un@@ wa@@ vering lifel@@ ess helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after having made various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel for a while and opened a snack bar after a while .
A@@ shar@@ on Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Behind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans have been created , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu of restaurants tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;

&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul where people can learn of packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their crops on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end , stability and prosperity are standing . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament reviews a draft bill , which suggests that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration by a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users must be able to use social networks within six months after a successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and identification number . &quot;
&quot; those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months imprisonment , or to en@@ act a penalty payment . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty parliam@@ ent@@ arians , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the European Parliament submitted a legislative proposal to be introduced in the har@@ sher pen@@ alties for the President &apos;s ins@@ ult or high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult of President and state institutions is pun@@ ish@@ able . however , such a act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , such as legal experts of the Media Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the verdi@@ cts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of expression has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a prominent example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian police , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup targeting the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest participants , who were arrested in the same incident , four years imprisonment for a court of law . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison administration failed to bring the accused to prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , including arms possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke to two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;

does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to new rules of the information office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media need permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the rules , it is stated that registration with the full right name is required . &quot;
analysts suspect that the elimination of anony@@ mi@@ zed comments can be reached within social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; Chinese citizens have suggested in the social media to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively , to protect citizen journalism and independence . &quot;
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , Russia &apos;s state cens@@ orship blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as an &quot; organiz@@ er of the information spread . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to the Russian government a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ by@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court decre@@ ed the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English articles , the indications that Turkey support the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication reported that the site was blocked because it was &quot; &quot; a source of information related to groups to attack a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , besides , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop turning up
&quot; following this week , the UK government is located in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance capabilities , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time and to install backup programs that dec@@ ryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consult@@ ed telecommunications companies and intelligence services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation still runs until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwar@@ ded to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
