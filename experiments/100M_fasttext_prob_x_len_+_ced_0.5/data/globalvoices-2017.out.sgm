<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is exceedingly great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"how many of my generation I grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American writers and run their sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me, that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporters who wanted to occupy the murderous plot of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to Method Man," I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country I've ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to accept in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very warmly love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his narrow-face.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops the mountain, as you say so nicely."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won in Republican elections, was the highest number given by the party nominee nominee."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that takes people out of all over the world, a deeply believing person, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trump's worldview did not agree with the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who lived for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Loey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice has helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump seized his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they were either separated from racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify the people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial, respectless and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hectic change in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that those voters, of whom most knows, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Anm. d. Ü.: as much as" rebellion of the Whites against all other ethnicities "; wordplay made of white in connection to the whites and whiplash, as it called the great Van Jones, has exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have, America is welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with choosing Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the White America's promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole term of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, was my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd responded with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "if Muslims have a place in your America?" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd rocked."</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they cried, and their voices became louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous and loud" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for whom his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is Trumps Land now," "said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find any place in this new America.</seg>

<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for a couple of years, the La banda de música (music bande) has been playing in the church: one of children and adults existing symphony orchestra, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central interest to the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this changed after a coincidence meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered his youth a rare glimpse of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members are very serious about their commitments to the music group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi writes:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you will always laugh and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 75,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Catecha - a village that is virtually at the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguayan capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reconditioned instruments composed of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Catecha, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact their parents because many of them didn't live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed as a baboo, which he never had seen before: a violin made of waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that targeted international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">"in the context of an agreement with Global Voices, the re-publishing occurs on the common use of content."</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it was looking for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were correspondingly upset, and little inclined to welcome a law breaker of this kind in their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised swiftly against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of plundering the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the Premier from their waters back then."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" so we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and are mutually involved in dealing with illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is captured is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. therefore illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the Schneckentempo, in real time, actions are happening in real time, traceable at FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there you can exchange existing licenses for each other, including news on suspicious activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a harbor inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open seas by satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas, such as those that indicate that a ship loads his caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fish fanfare, where they were on the way and possibly, if they were a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports based on this information, meaning that the ships can't sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay fines, as in the prime minister's case."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Director of nfd Africa. the latter is a consultant that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to win a estimated 20 million USD worth of lost revenues, which lost eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of the illegal fisheries that enter East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake licence papers, stating of fantasies, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the missing international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-organized control system," "says Long." "earlier, a ship was illegal fishing and a country could then say" "You don't have to run my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say" "Come to me". "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">"so far, the closed front has been working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has discovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities, and it has been persecuted and found fleeting ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to make suspicious ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, also helps to detach the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that we try to cross, "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, who also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"for example, some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be shipped by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"for this reason, Copeland is helping to build a system that combines different information levels. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminals with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>

<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - this simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and consolidate their resources."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts have a similar project with which a global system allows the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only sense criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"Shiri Appleby in" "Code Black" "dabei"</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats buy more licenses since then."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found on board towing nets whose use is prohibited."</seg>

<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars are destroyed by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries joined together to go to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they now fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With safety, the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country was able to report its first great triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag."</seg>

<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the administration of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately the reluctance of a new election was blocked by official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"as part of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to establish a new governance alliance."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive voice skills in order to understand the original text and to provide active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">"in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate into French into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue, translation into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-books or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who have no foreign employees themselves, can make translations delivered in the company. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the sworn and enigmatic propositions, which are created by mechanical translations, show that this technology cannot replace any human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery, or at least harmless. but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up in order to share citizens with permission to share social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with acceptance of the law, users must register on the website of the site with their right names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, this could result in a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a repentance."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video content and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced if it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the user registration. it is unclear how they should make those who are not able to register on the level of social media companies."</seg>

<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request a permit or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they do it through hip-hop and thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders are bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStar."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is raising awareness that young participants in discussions on topics such as" cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self acceptance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the territory of the Kitsumcalypse First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section in West Canada, where almost two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always rule the languages of the First Nations."</seg>

<seg id="719">"in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, near the entrance Shokuhin sanpuru (" Plastic models of dishes ") are displayed by each dish that is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic courts and decide whether they enter or pass the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic courts.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokioters district Kappabashi, there are a large number of small businesses that produce those plastic courts, documented by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic courts are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into striking cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>

<seg id="752">"after each body, behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal político has called the digital project" aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" "live with the drug trafficking" ") to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who were in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>

<seg id="784">She continues:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (german: drug trafficker) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, it is, as if they are sinking those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are too naked figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inlessness of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified that they were "ugly."</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to claim that they remain spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" Four months blackmail in the main town district: like a family with threats, it describes how the armed criminals had torn money from their business until they were not only destroyed by the business, but also torn apart their families.

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the post "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>

<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years earlier, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>

<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>

<seg id="934">"this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">"the spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example, for example)."</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern that violent images of readers and spectators are desensitizing and their ability to perceive empathy (such as this study which investigates how violent media work to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss with non-violent depictions in the news media, it is fact that it is indispensable for today's news coverage."</seg>

<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely sloping connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>

<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that they should respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences."</seg>

<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, Maharashtra, nine women, among them health personnel as well as housewives, came to a unique club and thus became the main theme of the city."</seg>

<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Video Volunteers community and advocates for the dismantling of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawar has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices, such as children's heir to exile from HIV- and AIDS infected, and heads these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini presented in her discussion group, acted by women who did not call her husbands name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchate with a problem, with which women can easily identify themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the name of their husbands does not speak loudly, is a Brauch that they all owe to all obligations and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of any thoughts about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband, wanted to try at home as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"practice, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate. "some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the lap, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rae SREMMURD | Special Guests: Bobo SWAE, IMPXCT Ab 19.00 until 23.00"</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, means that they don't respect us?"</seg>

<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," "says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women never speak the name of her husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she kissed her during the whole exercise; another decided to allow the whole frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the adrenalin rush of breaking with an ancient brewing, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home their husbands name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife couldn't stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it in front of the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"as her mother-in-law she stared, she got scared and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was done in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the cinch red dot on the forehead that shows the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the cinch-red point if he did it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"he laughed only, and I heard it to bear him."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped completely, but they think they are now in a better position, even to choose not to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make an excursion at every discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear something," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say things loudly, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is associated with the clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most, it's okay, but some wanted a Salman-Kurta, a wide shirt about a pants, wear; they did not dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothes, morals combined with saris and much more, Rohini found her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will be able to do it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"the question is whether in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly moving into the roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped telling the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do not make it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two men continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the cliff for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a hard-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a sacrifice of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish because Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blog osphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He underlined that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one asked if New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," turning the logic "to defend the existing authoritarian exercising of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, one can say that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from responsibilities, a compulsory violation."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of that, he seemed undemocratically undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the main point of the subject, the good old groans emerge from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the answers to his American guests were given answers to his American guests with regard to our press, our Judicial, our political system."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"on the other hand, there is no need for such questions."</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng challenged Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the Government of Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that he is really, and aware of what he defends."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula. it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillene frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula, and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">"in the anteroom, there is a parrot in a cage."</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - even hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs Ramírez tells the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast, they begin to cry:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you in Mom Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have slept on boxes outside."</seg>
<seg id="1912">You don't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she helps them and brings them to hospital if they are ill, she buys medicines they can't pay, she massages them with a balm that is exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived shortly before."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"with his sister, Sebastiao hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil already in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to normally take a first stop in South America and then move towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans are often travelling along the route and that Africans are already talking to Whatsapp of Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months now: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Ms. Ramírez tells that her guests send her often text messages, when they are gone to grind her or report her about the course of her journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark hoping for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started helping them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchenette outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his work place from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a young man, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family lives and tries to decide where the next step is to go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, the travellers consulate quietly their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a small bus arrived today, and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic for those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she shook her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hairdressers, who made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old."</seg>

<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, ethnic minorities in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the cell phone users in the Tianshan district of the city Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which they indicated the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the announcement, it is said that the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But kònthens the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police state that the app was investigating and prosecuting the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protected service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic websites, online fraud, Trojan and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"of course, an app with these functions can be used in many ways."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and the South, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>

<seg id="1985">"after installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones become electronic handhelds in Xinjiang."</seg>
<seg id="1986">"the rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council, to minimize the spread of illegal content."</seg>

<seg id="2096">"Hdaib has been a passionate activist for six years, confronting the conservative majority and questioned its well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often discusses topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also asks the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"at the age of 25, Hdaib has seen himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind and he can sympathize with people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he doesn't openly admit it openly, he has a special reluctance against US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones can do anything with his identity as" "Palestinian refugees of the second generation." "he himself describes himself, even when he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own life circumstances," "emphasizes Hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think, because I am a person, "while he dissolved in water, Nescafé poured into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"in principle, the sludge of lukewarm coffee and the rakes of Kent cigars in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if one throws a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it simply avoids to do basic things - as in public during Ramadan water - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Interior Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MEPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert tabernacle."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the members and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was" "straight" "because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which inquire the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to advocate for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should not be simply silky rhetoric, but in fact an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan reflected in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned traditional sex-trees to Leibe by abolishing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have been premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently low-worn unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of" "honorary morals" "- the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, Jordanian is still lacking institutional infrastructure in order to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence in appropriate ways."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime control from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence can often be held at unspecified time, and for their release, a long-lasting bureaucratic effort and the guarantee provided by the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well known to shy away from issues that have long been regarded as tabu in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib has denied that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music, the full explicit acts of sexuality, freedom and expression of expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I became politics," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib accepts the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>

<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse repeatedly repeats itself:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and each other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in his words," that can get what you want "- whether it is faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib was an interview for the popular jordanian online program Roya, to note that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not apply to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuova, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuova could work on behalf of the caliph in eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, such as Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemian kingdom, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being put to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service arrested several former government members and members of the teacher's association with the reason that they could have critically criticised the problems that were deeply rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaibs's concert is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant aging and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is how it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreamed of an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of how to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is approaching with music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, uniforms and artificial kind of democracies. at least, he hopes that."</seg>

<seg id="2152">"it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tanata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the wagons, drums and the dancing over more than a thousand years ago, were marched in the armies of the West of Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi to its knees."</seg>

<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led that more and more regular citizens enter into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers' Batalla de Barberos', which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the article" Love messages on guerrilla fighters, "which publishes the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel discouraged, affection affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"just this question, the two young Colombian activists, Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt and Cristian Palacios Foundation, did not get out of the head and inspired them to the Carta por la Reconciliación campaign (letters to reconciliation), who encouraged young people to write letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was a scene of historical events and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla force FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signatory of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and around the clock had to integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeply hatred towards guerrilla fighters, they must now take part in their ranks and support them in establishing a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians had to join together and to help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, who will then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter to reconciliation was taken on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá, where Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's day, but those who need much more needy."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he wanted to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent need."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"this was the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former combatants of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"" "I never thought that someone would forgive me" ""</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo, travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were so on how they had done it earlier in order to counteract the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings you can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between, "told the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca Province, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former combatant led me to the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of refuge in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go into, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-grenade launcher, a deadly weapon in the thorn bush."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he said," "Hey, what do they do?" "he answered," "I answer to a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I said to it."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him, and sat beside the pomegranate."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life as a war." "the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before the famine." "I never thought that anyone would be forgiven to me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"so far, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices.</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the first time, students and some leaders of the FARC were together with a discussion group."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"for this reason, the leaders of the FARC declared their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have experienced how social injustice helped the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who had never heard hearing and had no electoral right, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated people who were turned around by their lives and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed and have done so much damage, can bring us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbians prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to attack and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as a basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about sexual interruption, this is a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"some traditionally Caucasian elements, I still wear in me."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so much I wish, this spiritual barrier I cannot overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give myself a lot of effort to look like the person that she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who had scanned in Argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of the Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not unlock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end ask a proof that the so-called" "honor" "has been experienced by blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are men now detained in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend told me that there was just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been left by their relatives to face Kadyrov's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can present them as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but intentionally immersed in order to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself, when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have been allowed to shave these people?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">"in Chechnya, I had a Bob."</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already known before 2003 when I was living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>

<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>

<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had painted lashes, wore tubes jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia never bowed to me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where each evening, especially at weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>

<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period lasted?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could sense how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who had gelded and laughed before, gazed at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic was steadily worse."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waiter.</seg>

<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, which is a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with the feminism, even with the intersectionist not"</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-through scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays still earn less money than men nowadays despite the same education."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women have come sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender is still spreading across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer twice and triple among them."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, if I come to the skin colour, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community, or black women from the Diaspora; if I speak out what kind of we are physically, mentally and verbally abused, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectionale feminists have to be silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift their voices and sing" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and generations make less earning than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of being exposed to domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men and all men of all skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustice in her mind, who refuses to refer to the sex as well as the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women and has always rejected me.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "am I not a woman?" "and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a demented and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings that are also absorbed by cultural appropriation our customs and customs to advance their self-centered program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">"for some of them will continue to remain silent for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different income a home and to cut off from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of myself fully and completely from feminism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of putting myself into a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we define black women after our own ideas and go into the spheres that will be created by us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _"</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither exaggerated nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2469">"Nabil Musa repeatedly traveled over the past 7 years, mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern of the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance, which is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we don't have any water, how would we survive? "</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article" The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay "by Kurts. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# weightless-consuming), which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner, who had become violent to her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time has passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena for abuse, the accustomed ad of Ada Báez was not useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second wife withdrew her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women make an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"(to create paragraphs, you simply leave blank lines.)"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really ill-treated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, there were 9600 advertisements for domestic violence in the District Attorney Office. 70% of these were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 advertisements because of domestic violence among the peacebuilders. here, 86% of women's ads came from women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true dimension of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"at the end of 2014, two women who do not do this will come to each woman who will not do this," she explained in the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder is not a criminal offence in Paraguay, law enforcement authorities cannot document how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners."</seg>

<seg id="2506">"at the beginning, she didn't want it, but gave it to me. this should always regret it."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together. but for two years she carried the psychic power on her part - one of the most common forms of violence against women, and at the same time the most recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would once again become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women are going to be subservient because they can be fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against it and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mistreated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te creo ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victorias, everything began with psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner ultimately managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias advertisements in the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she conducted a trial against her former partner, who developed into an impenetrable legal battle between Paraguay and her native country where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>

<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws that are very good but cannot be applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Women's Organization for Women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in the use of laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# fürst)."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com's website, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outrageous, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many salatas he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only used for single varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or angled leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants such as grain or carton types. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts in food security are concerned about the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton still breeding salad, he needs a longer time since his work becomes more difficult and more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river there is a rock boulder to which I have to sweep.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think these patents on salads are too far away."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new lettuce because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"in addition, he has joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (" Open Source "breeders)."</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have cultivated and eaten red rum salat of the variety Outrageous in the "greenhouse" of the station. there is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" Open Source "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called into the life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, so that plant breeders can be used permanently."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, shortly called OSSI, U.S. breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open Source "breeders only allow others to breed their seeds, to breed their own varieties, and it is not immediately available - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patrons."</seg>
<seg id="2648">"since its launch in 2014, dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seed and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed money plays a role in greater cohesion such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"this means that the resource in question identified itself as" "XHTML 1.0 Strict" "and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to helping others to keep their seeds free, as opposed to patenting seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gene pool due to the ever-increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available, unceasingly shrinking."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of OSSI, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are not such estimates yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that massive cultivated plants like wheat are patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred that they have specifically engineered characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour improves to such, because they thrive in certain environments and keep threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"against this background, papers focusing on reasons for, or on results or measurement of such matching problems are particularly welcome. call for Papers 12th IWH / IAB-Workshop on Labour Market Policies Online Survey of the IAB web presence"</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto noted that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property holds other breeders as" patents and protection of plant varietal innovations. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expires. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same outcome with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovations, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants that are adapted to the altered environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general well and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" "we do not create the characteristics themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves, and as a breeder, we have no idea how the plants do this."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" "if you breed a variety, you also breed its own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are needed for their cultivation of mass herbicides, breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly gentler. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, most small seed companies can also survive without patents - either reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in addition, Morton is convinced that breeders would be more innovative to avoid plant patents:" "it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than the company that patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years", "he says." "with a patent one is protected from competition for 20 years, with which one can simply make it easy for my opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seems to be a leader in the" Open Source, "the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a" open-source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol works on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeders vary from country to country, where the OSSI obligation cannot be taken over to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it appeals against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventional cultivated plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch Organisation of Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the" Open Source "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for" Open Source "seed systems explains that the organisation is currently building a global alliance for" open source "seed systems, planned for the planned next year of the official launch."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental protection and development assistance groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - action group on erosion, technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a context, from the Luby of OSSI hopes that it will soon become more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly paid attention to where and how it is grown, and seeds systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people realize that even more behind their food is."</seg>
