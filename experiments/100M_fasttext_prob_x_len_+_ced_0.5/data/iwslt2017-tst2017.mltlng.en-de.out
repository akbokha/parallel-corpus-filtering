this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the NSA has illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a catastro@@ phic US secret service operation in which the CIA passed literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter does not like ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of saying whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to condemn and spy journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Charter , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous rep@@ orters already did before him : he refused and said he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although she stated for years , it is essential for her case , the demands of the government have fallen to tears . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the rep@@ orters and sources can still hide themselves less . &quot;
&quot; instead of bringing tears and tears to the statements , they could also do their digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secre@@ tly wor@@ ries his phone sec@@ rec@@ y , &quot;
&quot; as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , credit card information , and even travel cards with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack at pres@@ umed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is classified as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game which should be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more possibilities to spy out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allows to circum@@ vent the rights of Rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can contact them from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that still didn &apos;t exist when Ris@@ en had written its book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transfer system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as in any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encryp@@ ted and stored on a server where only the respective mess@@ aging agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secre@@ tly , and many of the information that she would request would not be available from the outs@@ et . &quot;
&quot; however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to make sure that not only technology den@@ omin@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to have missions . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental officer , the alarm on the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der , who warns us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; were hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has re@@ signed .
&quot; in addition , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has made letter box firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin is leading a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous c@@ elli@@ st . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait for the next release , and on the next exposed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we go ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that affects us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide their wealth and to disgu@@ ise -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ blast flu .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the United States .
&quot; it is probably because there have been no prominent Americans , who came to this scandal in these revel@@ ations . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; however , by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some U.S. states to set up a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of intim@@ acy in the US has allowed employees from school districts to wi@@ pe school children .

it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the U.S. to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; it really shocked us , that everyone has made suggestions to our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ occup@@ ations . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .

&quot; it is not about a single top politician , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to deal with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult .
&quot; this may sound quite ridicul@@ ous , as though we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , we have seen pre@@ dat@@ ors towards more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has registered in central regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies .
&quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say , &quot; &quot; In@@ visibility is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use this kind of in@@ visibility through laws .
&quot; together , we can finally end the in@@ accur@@ acies that are now enabling this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made an advance reservation . &quot;
a type in the red Mazda was standing and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards , he would go to peace scor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to be ab@@ duc@@ ted in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; then I heard me say , &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Here , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night , I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling , and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what have I burned here ? &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , at to@@ e pointed at the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the work of art , which he had bought from me , hang@@ s in his classroom . he is now teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my perspective completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ough@@ ing , my ro@@ omm@@ ate draws off and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . &quot;
Ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded such a &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed a@@ N@@ d Bed = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
I am sure that our che@@ eses @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
did we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
the things came into rolling .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website that people share public photos of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the internet , they can invite wild people to sleep with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missile to ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one , who is still at Tro@@ st , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all learned as children that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you &apos;re referring to the things you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
&quot; at the Academy of Art , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design be such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to make sure you unlock your mobile phone .
enter multiple addresses separated by commas and / or different lines .
this silent pl@@ ough of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel if they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is even more personal than your mobile is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most guests feel comfortable if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; quote from : Lim@@ e@@ Wire on 26 . may 2011 , 22 : 02 : 55 PM &quot;
could you please tell on Twitter that he is chann@@ elled to the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor would have imagined with his name only once , if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 evidence , which all say , &quot; &quot; He can really hold very well @-@ un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel when you have to hand your mobile phone ?
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; at the beginning , we have done some things wrong . &quot;
it was difficult for the people to leave negative jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had handed their verdi@@ cts before we presented them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and location . &quot;
not surprisingly we trust the people most of us who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; if you have less than three references , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stems from common@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you deal with . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; as for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle Art@@ works in your apartment ! I make my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on how to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
&quot; third , a need that was not covered before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is very good . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who celebrated un@@ lawful part@@ ys or rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have got guests in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
I stood at the for@@ efront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays had only a fra@@ ction per problem . &quot;
people familiar with each other .
&quot; if trust works , won@@ dro@@ us can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made vacation in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , who tend to tend to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know it properly . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car into the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want one to feel lonely , they bring books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is running . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of part@@ ing with money transactions coinci@@ de ?
it is about economic trade .
&quot; but now just to call &quot; &quot; rent &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
read the rest of this entry &quot;
people place a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place that one visits , a group there would be waiting for Ans@@ wers to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub &apos;s corner from which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to design apartments of reason to join together ?
how would it look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of common participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us to make society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
&quot; students , who were searching for a lead , were now offered . &quot;
&quot; they were sent to people whose children were gone out . there were inc@@ ub@@ ator programs , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be as crazy as it was brought to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality gave it even before .
there were similar websites already .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find that start@@ ling , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda is passing on me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply del@@ aying at the airport security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most of them would not know any Muslim .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver @-@ fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
and I am a practi@@ sing spiritual mus@@ li@@ in .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because baby , I wasn &apos;t born so . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to wear hi@@ j@@ ab , my head covering . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and in contrast to the pressure that I felt as the 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and un@@ achiev@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have risen with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; I read it , thought , wondering , dou@@ b@@ ted and thought ultimately . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
&quot; it was tru@@ sting and slow dedication , deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an . &quot;
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone else perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later , I married and began like all the good Egyp@@ tians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock was quickly transformed into indig@@ nation .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others were transformed by others from a citizen into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I was dig@@ ging -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time being recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we went to our apartment in this night , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations who said : &quot; &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Vers@@ am@@ ma@@ m not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day , where Muslims gathered to pray . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who thought to be free for Muslims . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have got the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was fur@@ ious too .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and include mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church like a tum@@ our in the USA &apos;s body .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , er@@ ers and Olymp@@ ism . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to more toler@@ ant people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establish@@ es its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their preferences , if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when one thro@@ ws a glance at them , they do not cast out what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality they can read these things into the Scrip@@ tures .
a prominent Imam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring it into difficulty . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that gave sense to her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke to her a solution . &quot;
this Imam asked the connection to God and its church again .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
what they learned in the mos@@ que kept them to join the IS .
this was an insight how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : when people publish messages in which neg@@ atively informed about Muslims , they agree on military attacks on Muslim lands as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not only an academic problem .
&quot; if you see when the mood against Muslims rise up , between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about having to declare themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Ch@@ apel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when did the young man become such an experienced young man ? &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had posted in the afternoon . &quot;
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the start .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would be controlled by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided to go to the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , and went into the bones , and what I saw , let me ad@@ here . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Imam made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the gather@@ ings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
&quot; in this moment , I have collap@@ sed . &quot;
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you sure to go safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what would you say to those who might claim that you hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a teacher with draft , working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive yourself . I &apos;m totally normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study to Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , it is just before being a billion @-@ dollar business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air package creation entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France was built on a six metre high tower in France . a few years ago , they began to fly with ro@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; through inter@@ connecting flights , flight equipment reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
they can also build independently re@@ trac@@ table structures .
&quot; they have learned to wear loads , dealing with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; so that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located in space . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; External commands are available on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear star@@ ters , &quot;
&quot; a flying machine , trying to beat two flies with a fla@@ p . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and has therefore great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping page . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the air unit will recover the optimal position and improve performance by practicing .
&quot; OK , now I just want BF1918 /
&quot; during our research , we often face basic abstract questions that perme@@ ate the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of mov@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of mov@@ able parts that meet to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly away @-@ controlled flight equipment , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
we discovered that flying with just one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ an , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ operated flight equipment . it was invented by a short time ago . &quot;
&quot; it has only a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ amps , hing@@ es and cross@@ rest , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inside lives very much so that it can fly stable and move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ an is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ Cou@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his orientation .
&quot; in this way , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some are available in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; if you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- a engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can the machine continue to fly , even if limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making one half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration examines the synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allow a palette of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weigh@@ s less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where it is , and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; on Broadway , the particularly secure machine would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , wages are in the development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; nearly 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were orbit@@ ing each other in a very far distant gal@@ ax@@ y , they transformed the mass of three sun in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole world known universe . &quot;
it was a very big boy .
&quot; their energy , however , did not set them in the form of light -- &quot;
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time ge@@ stures and the universe exploded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events at a time .
&quot; before 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has brought some things : coral , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; approximately 25 years ago , a group decided to build a particularly Mu@@ tiger -- Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are about by colli@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them kept them mad .
but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector LI@@ GO : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of LI@@ GO improved significantly , which greatly improved the detection performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is now called Advanced LI@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; in early September 2015 , LI@@ GO was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commission@@ ing of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes through the Earth were scre@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; they went through you and me , &quot;
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Birth of My Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my to@@ d@@ dly father .
&quot; basically , that was the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a correlation between space and time .
&quot; when pre@@ aching the shaft , the space and its entire content is stretched into one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illu@@ stra@@ tive purposes , lect@@ urers in courses of rel@@ ativity often lead to a properly al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stri@@ pped at the meeting of the waves . the stretching of an average person was 10 @-@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 Dar@@ um , one declared the LI@@ GO employees mad . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , it would have to be precisely measured to less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are huge . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to LI@@ GO . Scott claimed that LI@@ GO was more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical . for so , you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; in case of killing , that is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you very much : &quot;
your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain features like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampli@@ tude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble area .
&quot; when we transform wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe literally . &quot;
&quot; the Gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , just around : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@
it is a kind of motion @-@ shaped loud@@ speaker em@@ bos@@ sed into the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- I heard this as sound from -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the sticks of your mixer . &quot;
AA : think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the den@@ si@@ est body in the universe , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , revol@@ ves around a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent significance of LI@@ GO .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to research the universe as it has never been possible before .
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the All @-@ Hear@@ ing and the Un@@ seen . &quot;
we can &apos;t see much in the universe - practically or basically -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ sh stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes happen at the core which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
&quot; we will never see through , as these are opaque . &quot;
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see and of whom we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; indeed , LI@@ GO found things that we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , is an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says on this subject : me : the type of stars that produce black holes such as LI@@ GO watches are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to speak , the sour cher@@ ubs for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the urine yourself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for a year , I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; before I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
do I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
do I want to be live on television ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
do I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : just to do what I feared , my fear removed . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping words , my social anxiety -- pipe , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , on an unexpected way . it began with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , har@@ pers , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ expla@@ in@@ able reasons all &quot; valu@@ ing , &quot; &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
&quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I feel very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I realized that the &quot; Yes &quot; Sa@@ ws to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things get out of my life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for contributing 70 hours of program to the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
every program offers hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
350 million dollars for a season .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I created myself , and not only produced , so on top . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires circul@@ ating around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing this ?
&quot; no one , therefore , I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; writer &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you all of you who work so hard , whether you &apos;re running a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , a business or a budget to take me seriously when I speak of work so you can understand that I am not just around the computer and more imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it is not about dreams in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I deep@@ en the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land out of nothing .
&quot; it is , as I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a result , you have a high tone , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; she is creative , mechan@@ ically , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work runs well .
&quot; a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could always go on it . &quot;
many people take the sums when I explain to them that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but hum@@ ming -- when I began working with television , when I began to work and work , to build , create , create , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ ming , this energy . &quot;
sum@@ ming is more than writing .
sum@@ ming is action and activity . the sum@@ ming is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sums , then you can &apos;t strive for great@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of being unable to be different than asp@@ iring to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called sum@@ ming .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is genius .
maybe it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I &apos;m not doing it for failure , and I only know that I love hum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more over@@ rated borders , the more work there is , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more the expectations are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about my work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country that I &apos;m creating , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , sum@@ ming , sums , sums , sums . &quot;
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sums .
am I just this sum ?
and then the sums stop .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burned out . &quot;
the Sum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the truth that their mother is a single work stit@@ cher .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums ceased . &quot;
the hum@@ ming of the engine was pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I didn &apos;t like my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sums came not back .
my sum@@ ming was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , continuous weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect titanium .
&quot; I was a preview Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; present you out , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves to be a painter , Bill Gates . &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no more than to be aware of two things :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; estimate . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they call no more &quot; &quot; estimate &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my sum@@ ming , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and their sisters stum@@ ble , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , can &apos;t do anything except to fit . &quot;
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
&quot; the country I &apos;m creating , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , tender voices , watch@@ men and the song in which it goes to letting go , or whatever the girl let loose in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that is not right away , but it happens it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the hum@@ ming , but a hum@@ ming . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no mystery . only love .
it &apos;s something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the work sums , the tit@@ an@@ en@@ um@@ men , that &apos;s just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how well my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
sum@@ ming is no force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real hum@@ ming depends on love .
the sums are the electricity that comes from the lust of life .
the real hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real hum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , which leads to enlighten@@ ing tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real hum@@ ming is simple and original .
&quot; the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it &apos;s just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to be at work as at home .
&quot; this con@@ fession is painful , for what a person works better than to be a house ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we ras@@ en around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst out soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I feel predominantly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it &apos;s o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe are filled with me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with games ?
you can also say it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you keep me na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dream .
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ eks replace me . &quot;
and talking to my teen @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes long with me I am Mother of the Year .
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more do not need . &quot;
&quot; each can apply for 15 minutes , even at a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes per piece !
&quot; no mobile , no clothes , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to do . &quot;
but 15 minutes are possible !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
about &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself in 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to meet myself more and more .
15 minutes on the piece why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums then seem to return if I don &apos;t work .
work does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it ful@@ fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sums are not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , d@@ inners with friends . &quot;
this is my sum@@ ming .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work are part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
&quot; it is my doll that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp fire still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier are I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , stub@@ born , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am a writer . I think that I am going to bring you to life .
&quot; this is a job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dream .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
I am neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was a neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
&quot; for sure , they have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered under heavy trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; at the time , I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room . &quot;
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that cran@@ ial brain trau@@ mat@@ a sw@@ ells the brain and increases the skull pressure .
&quot; in order to save lives , it is necessary to reduce the skull pressure . &quot;
sometimes a part of s@@ wollen brain mass is necessary .
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a piece of tissue , it is comparable to small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François made it . &quot;
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can transform into each cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
&quot; they never die , they are imm@@ ortal . &quot;
but these cells were different .
they were slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ral c@@ ort@@ ex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the fet@@ us stage , it is responsible for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they keep us ?
we don &apos;t know this .
&quot; we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so secure . &quot;
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables cer@@ eb@@ ral healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells , as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and they then mark colour in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we rei@@ m@@ pl@@ eted them at the acceptance test of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- auto@@ transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ur@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ur@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we had an injury to and her@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been pl@@ anti@@ ed .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we were in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we left the mot@@ oric area in the mot@@ oric Cort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; then the ap@@ es were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hands anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spont@@ ane@@ ously recre@@ ated themselves up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover from a certain degree , just as in the ap@@ es . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand they see the ap@@ es , who spont@@ ane@@ ously recovered . &quot;
he can bring about 40 % to 50 % of his original performance before injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after rei@@ m@@ plant@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; I can tell you , these were also very exciting results for us . &quot;
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use later .
&quot; we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant it in humans .
I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look further into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the clinical trial &apos;s approval . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants
&quot; first , you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
&quot; in the West , we make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident . &quot;
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant which it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing ge@@ stures .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ mi@@ sts in Beijing have proved no doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally declared to me as finance ministers in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; in this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for a genuine democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group believe , we could save us democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ sible democracy . &quot;
&quot; because without democracy , our societies are bl@@ amed , our future ble@@ ak and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognise him as the debt mountain , who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all realise the debt mountain , &quot;
but only a few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the wealthy spar@@ ers and corporations , which are too fear@@ ful to invest where it would be productive and to produce income by which one could produce the debt mountain , and could also produce all the things that humanity urg@@ ently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ llion dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ llion dollars sound after much money , until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ llion US dollars , around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low macroeconomic demand that is feared for the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who fear that his son would kill him when he grows , &quot;
&quot; if the circumstances are un@@ inten@@ tionally leading , O@@ edi@@ pus kill@@ eth him . &quot;
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
&quot; all un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we understand under democracy ? &quot;
&quot; Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society , in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was too many from -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to minim@@ ise the importance of ath@@ en@@ ical democracy based on these conclusions . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that they were involved in the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political participation in questions of state concerns . &quot;
the ath@@ ic democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle that lights up very bright , it is burned too quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , today &apos;s liberal democra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthening the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two and the economy gradually under@@ went politics and em@@ powered it . &quot;
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it can be nowadays in the government today , and still not in power , because the power of politics is declining and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my stri@@ fe with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably nour@@ ish the animals , from which they feed , dec@@ im@@ ated , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy which has leg@@ alized politics as far as it has been har@@ med by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism drives down the &quot; demo@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we need to bring together politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; re@@ tains control , as in the ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
&quot; the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago , and it wasn &apos;t very good . &quot;
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ acon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position like in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste of being wealthy , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; we must re@@ vis@@ e the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and ensure that we are democra@@ ti@@ zing the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which makes the film &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements of it . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that the society is in &quot; Star Trek &quot; in the machines and people are serving their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; what would it need , how could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company , please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from a firm to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital , and out of redemption , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no more distinction between those among whom the companies belong , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there whom the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately not a temporary twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest threshold countries &#93; , in the interest of the entire humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum paid to the trade deficit or the trading income of the respective country , into a mutual fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are scar@@ ce . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Brett@@ on W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal in which they preferred privileged persons , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the m@@ ül@@ lei@@ derer of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world where we can present real democracy .
&quot; we will wake up in such a world , &quot;
or are we going to sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democra@@ tically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liberal Marxists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do not , technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers is called a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transfer@@ ring this crisis from one part of Earth to the next , as we are experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ se our democra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as well as Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore , I am totally lost . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not working , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think about the West &apos;s view on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal democra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say so provoc@@ ative , China is similar today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill &quot;
it was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what you can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells mighty after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a finance minister at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to start a new start with the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro zone , &quot;
&quot; to say good @-@ bye to the self @-@ gra@@ ding , and the continued denial that a massive displac@@ ement line ran through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; it is right to do it . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continue to deny the denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may be delayed for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ v : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
&quot; if there is a minister of finance , or any minister who has been in office after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has not made any mistakes , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed it was an honest interest in the side of the credi@@ tors to find a joint solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to kill our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the gra@@ tification that ran through the Eurozone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a dis@@ astro@@ us program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; there is worse than &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one from the Tro@@ ika of the len@@ ders charged with this policy was a &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone doesn &apos;t survive .
&quot; for if it doesn &apos;t survive , the released forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have catastro@@ phic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will also be intoler@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are lying wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for having TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price most of them have never heard , although it is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
that goes to the decision which Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has an idy@@ ll and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are quite right on this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation version of more than 2500 TV series on the website . the evaluation dates from 1 to 10 , and the height shows how many shows are received . &quot;
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; this is shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where , after a season has looked out , your brain asks : &quot; where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough of what happens at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to enter@@ tain &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average output , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t delight . &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price wants nothing to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )

episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
but they don &apos;t know they &apos;re watching at watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who absorb everything .
&quot; you record , when you start the show , when you pause , what parts you ski@@ p or look at again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and the answer is : &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republican US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.@@ 4 is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- something above the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give to the shows , which shows they like etc . &quot;

&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so , exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
you are optimized with a very powerful computer .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , this is a little fri@@ ghtening , because we are living in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in jail here in the United States and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show is good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , in spite of the many data , &quot;
not always produces the best results . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can predict break@@ through@@ s of influ@@ enza , the worse way -- by data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
&quot; it worked wonderful and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it worked just fine , year by year , until it didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ voc@@ ation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided Gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can use many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy . &quot;
&quot; over the years , I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed . &quot;
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you basically do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a branch , you put together the items together to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision , especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that is why I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence wherever they belong to the process . &quot;

Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first they were competing for TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they were always able to say , &quot; That &apos;s what the data tells us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most probably &quot; -- right here at this moment .
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; so far I met some decisions in my life , whereby I would have to listen to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know when you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a bit more cl@@ ums@@ y , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message , that despite the large amount of data it is still paying off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and take risks . &quot;
&quot; because at the end , it is not the data but the risks you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
