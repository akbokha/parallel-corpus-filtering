<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally listened to phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation in which the CIA passed literally drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter does not like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined and urged him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of saying whistleblower to condemn and spy journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Charter, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused and said he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although she stated for years, it is essential for her case, the demands of the government have fallen to tears."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can still hide themselves less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of bringing tears and tears to the statements, they could also do their digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, secretly worries his phone secrecy,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as well as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, credit card information, and even travel cards with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack at presumed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is classified as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security has been the result of a whistleblower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game which should be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more possibilities to spy out all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allows to circumvent the rights of Reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can contact them from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that still didn't exist when Risen had written its book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transfer system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, which has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as in any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective messaging agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information that she would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that jeopardize us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to make sure that not only technology denominators such as Edward Snowden have a chance to have missions. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next environmental officer, the alarm on the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the largest data leak of history was published.] [the" Panama Papers "revealed that rich and powerful] were hidden in tax havens.] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]"</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Mossack Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"in addition, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has made letter box firms in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin is leading a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait for the next release, and on the next exposed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or John-Grisham's novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we go?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide their wealth and to disguise -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a matryoblast flu.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">"it is probably because there have been no prominent Americans, who came to this scandal in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some U.S. states to set up a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intimacy in the US has allowed employees from school districts to wipe school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the U.S. to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"it really shocked us, that everyone has made suggestions to our investigators, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all preoccupations. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to deal with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound quite ridiculous, as though we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the past few years, we have seen predators towards more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has registered in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say," "Invisibility is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use this kind of invisibility through laws.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally end the inaccuracies that are now enabling this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made an advance reservation."</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda was standing and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards, he would go to peace scorps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where are you sleeping tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse:" "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to be abducted in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard me say," "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Here, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night, I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling, and thought," Oh man! what have I burned here? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, at toe pointed at the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the work of art, which he had bought from me, hangs in his classroom. he is now teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost ploughing, my roommate draws off and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think about how we could earn something. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded such a "air mattress and breakfast" [Airbed aNd Bed = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure that our cheeses-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and fell into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented ourselves to the investors:" we want to create a website that people share public photos of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the internet, they can invite wild people to sleep with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still at Trost, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned as children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you're referring to the things you can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Academy of Art, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to make sure you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter multiple addresses separated by commas and / or different lines.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent plough of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel if they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is even more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel comfortable if they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>

<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have imagined with his name only once, if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>

<seg id="172">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="173">"at the beginning, we have done some things wrong."</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to leave negative judgments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had handed their verdicts before we presented them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and location."</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly we trust the people most of us who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by judgments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three references, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you deal with."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"as for example:" "I have problems with my mother" "-- -- the request is rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle Artworks in your apartment! I make my family holiday." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on how to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that was not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is very good."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unlawful partys or ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have got guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>

<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>

<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>

<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone else perceives you, you fully understand, and yet loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later, I married and began like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "breaking news." ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock was quickly transformed into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:"... "in the name of Islam..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the acts of others were transformed by others from a citizen into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I was digging -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time being recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went to our apartment in this night, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations who said:" "be watchful," "" "Be careful," "" "Be careful," "" "Stay in well lit areas," "Versammam not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday in that week -- the day, where Muslims gathered to pray."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings," "Don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who thought to be free for Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was furious too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I don't have any questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and include mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my church like a tumour in the USA's body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, erers and Olympism."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking spaces, but don't stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, one has found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family so that the extremists believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"Marcia Cross in" "Quantico" "(Spoiler)"</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to their preferences, if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one throws a glance at them, they do not cast out what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality they can read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">A prominent Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every priest, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring it into difficulty."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that gave sense to her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who spoke to her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam asked the connection to God and its church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned in the mosque kept them to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: when people publish messages in which negatively informed about Muslims, they agree on military attacks on Muslim lands as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you see when the mood against Muslims rise up, between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about having to declare themselves."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did the young man become such an experienced young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had posted in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">"fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the start.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would be controlled by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, pulled out my shoes, and went into the bones, and what I saw, let me adhere."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the gatherings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"in this moment, I have collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you sure to go safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="407">"as a platform for hobbyists, it is just before being a billion-dollar business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air package creation entered into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France was built on a six metre high tower in France. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"through interconnecting flights, flight equipment reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build independently retractable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to wear loads, dealing with turbulence and generally react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"so that a system works autonomously, it must know collectively where the mobile objects are located in space."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"External commands are available on the highest level, e.g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starters,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flying machine, trying to beat two flies with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most starters, it can float, and has therefore great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping page."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the air unit will recover the optimal position and improve performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">"OK, now I just want BF1918 /</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face basic abstract questions that permeate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of movable parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly away-controlled flight equipment, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospan, the mechanically simplest remote-operated flight equipment. it was invented by a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clamps, hinges and crossrest, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, the inside lives very much so that it can fly stable and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospan is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the OmniCouter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">"in this way, he receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some are available in models, the rest is learned directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"but if something goes wrong -- a engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can the machine continue to fly, even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines the synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allow a palette of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where it is, and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Broadway, the particularly secure machine would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types like us, wages are in the development and the creative act."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="472">"their energy, however, did not set them in the form of light --"</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time gestures and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events at a time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"before 1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the Earth has brought some things: coral, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing at -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"approximately 25 years ago, a group decided to build a particularly Mutiger -- Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to search for gravitational waves, which are about by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them kept them mad.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO improved significantly, which greatly improved the detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, it is now called Advanced LIGO."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in early September 2015, LIGO was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes through the Earth were screened."</seg>
<seg id="486">"they went through you and me,"</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>

<seg id="490">And the farewell from my toddly father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, that was the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a correlation between space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when preaching the shaft, the space and its entire content is stretched into one direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative purposes, lecturers in courses of relativity often lead to a properly albering dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stripped at the meeting of the waves. the stretching of an average person was 10-21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1 Darum, one declared the LIGO employees mad."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometer laser detector, and that's already absurd, it would have to be precisely measured to less than one thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. that is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are huge. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claimed that LIGO was more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical. for so, you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in case of killing, that is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you very much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain features like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them." ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"when we transform wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the Gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, just around: wupp!"</seg>

<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- I heard this as sound from -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the sticks of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densiest body in the universe, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 probes, revolves around a hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent significance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to research the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this way, we can listen to the All-Hearing and the Unseen."</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in the universe - practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereish stars explode in supernovas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical processes happen at the core which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">"we will never see through, as these are opaque."</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back at the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, we will never see and of whom we have no idea. things that we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"indeed, LIGO found things that we didn't expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, is an important member of the LIGO project, says on this subject: me: the type of stars that produce black holes such as LIGO watches are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak, the sour cherubs for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>

<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for contributing 70 hours of program to the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Every program offers hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">Episode: # 5.04 Devil's Night (American Horror Story)</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">America's strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans-Atlantic security partnership</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts I created myself, and not only produced, so on top. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires circulating around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore, I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "writer" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you all of you who work so hard, whether you're running a company, a country or a classrooms, a business or a budget to take me seriously when I speak of work so you can understand that I am not just around the computer and more imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it is not about dreams in a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I deepen the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, as I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, you have a high tone, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanically, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best of it is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could always go on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take the sums when I explain to them that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but humming -- when I began working with television, when I began to work and work, to build, create, create, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this summing, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">Summing is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Summing is action and activity. the summing is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, then you can't strive for greatness."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of being unable to be different than aspiring to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called summing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I'm not doing it for failure, and I only know that I love humming."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more overrated borders, the more work there is, the more things at the same time, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more the expectations are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about my work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country that I'm creating, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, summing, sums, sums, sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stop.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, overdone, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The Summing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mother is a single work stitcher.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mum won't be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says," "I want to go to Shonda-Land." ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine was petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't like my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My summing was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, continuous weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a preview Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "present you out, stupid author Titan." ""</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you're doing it, you're doing it, you're working to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves to be a painter, Bill Gates."</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart ceases, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late and she says," "Mama, do you like playing?" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no more than to be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" estimate. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"they call no more" "estimate". ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and my summing, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, do you like playing?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters stumble, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of humming, can't do anything except to fit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I'm creating, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, tender voices, watchmen and the song in which it goes to letting go, or whatever the girl let loose in" The Ice Queen "." "</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not right away, but it happens it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it's silent, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the humming, but a humming."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no mystery. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the work sums, the titanenummen, that's just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV-hours and how well my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">Summing is no force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real humming depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums are the electricity that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real humming ignores the pressure of history, which leads to enlightening tasks, anticipation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real humming is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at work as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, for what a person works better than to be a house?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst out soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I feel predominantly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it's o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe are filled with me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing with games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me naïve for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you're right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">"after 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or Keks replace me."</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking to my teen-daughter whole 15 minutes long with me I am Mother of the Year.</seg>

<seg id="752">"each can apply for 15 minutes, even at a bad mood!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no clothes, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to do."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">About "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself in 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I'll fail and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" stands for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to meet myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums then seem to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fulfills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"for sure, they have one of the most well-known, the" deep brain stimulation. ""</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered under heavy tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at the time, I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room."</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that cranial brain traumata swells the brain and increases the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save lives, it is necessary to reduce the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes a part of swollen brain mass is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a piece of tissue, it is comparable to small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François made it."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are unripe cells, which can transform into each cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the fetus stage, it is responsible for the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so secure."</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables cerebral healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells, as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark colour in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we reimpleted them at the acceptance test of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplurate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplurate the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we had an injury to and hermplantied exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been plantied.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we were in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we left the motoric area in the motoric Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the apes were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hands anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recreated themselves up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover from a certain degree, just as in the apes."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left hand they see the apes, who spontaneously recovered."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"in the West, we make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant which it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging gestures.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big immists in Beijing have proved no doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy disappears with us in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally declared to me as finance ministers in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"in this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for a genuine democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup believe, we could save us democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensible democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"because without democracy, our societies are blamed, our future bleak and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognise him as the debt mountain, who throws his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all realise the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy sparers and corporations, which are too fearful to invest where it would be productive and to produce income by which one could produce the debt mountain, and could also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion dollars sound after much money, until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand that is feared for the pessimism of investors, who fear that his son would kill him when he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"if the circumstances are unintentionally leading, Oedipus killeth him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and to finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we understand under democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society, in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government."</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the athenical democracy was too many from --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to minimise the importance of athenical democracy based on these conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision of the athic democracy was and is that they were involved in the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political participation in questions of state concerns."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athic democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that lights up very bright, it is burned too quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthening the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bordered on politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two and the economy gradually underwent politics and empowered it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it can be nowadays in the government today, and still not in power, because the power of politics is declining and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my strife with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that sustainably nourish the animals, from which they feed, decimated, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy which has legalized politics as far as it has been harmed by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, economic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism drives down the" demoos "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we need to bring together politics and economy, and it would be better if the" demos "retains control, as in the ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">"the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago, and it wasn't very good."</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the deacon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste of being wealthy, and the social conflicts lower, as it is -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we must revise the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and ensure that we are democratizing the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological hyperautocracy which makes the film" "Matrix" "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements of it."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "or by something that the society is in" Star Trek "in the machines and people are serving their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"what would it need, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "-like Dystopie?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company, please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, from a firm to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income from capital, and out of redemption, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no more distinction between those among whom the companies belong, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there whom the company does not belong. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately not a temporary twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest threshold countries], in the interest of the entire humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Kosmos "-- and every government pays the sum paid to the trade deficit or the trading income of the respective country, into a mutual fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are scarce."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, in particular against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal in which they preferred privileged persons, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the mülleiderer of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world where we can present real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">"we will wake up in such a world,"</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>

<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of Earth to the next, as we are experiencing it, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>

<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy."</seg>

<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say so provocative, China is similar today to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill"</seg>
<seg id="997">It was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what you can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells mighty after hypocrisy."</seg>

<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>

<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the euro zone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say good-bye to the self-grading, and the continued denial that a massive displacement line ran through the eurozone, and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"it is right to do it. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable through political will and authoritarianism, it may be delayed for a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">Yv: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>

<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>

<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>

<seg id="1113">"data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?"</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision, especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that is why I believe, Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence wherever they belong to the process."</seg>

<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first they were competing for TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision because they were always able to say," That's what the data tells us. "</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most probably" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">"you can select the most suitable payment method: credit card, bank transfer, check, PayPal etc."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I met some decisions in my life, whereby I would have to listen to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know when you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a bit more clumsy, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message, that despite the large amount of data it is still paying off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because at the end, it is not the data but the risks you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
