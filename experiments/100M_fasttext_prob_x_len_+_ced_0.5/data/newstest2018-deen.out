Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view to the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren Ward , where you@@ ths are supposed to meet today . &quot;
a pit chapel where it is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small farmers cultivate the former basis of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had to be exciting , because the car navigation took place in a green me@@ adow instead of a perim@@ eter road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the State Government , are all other than current - but precisely so insi@@ ghtful . &quot;
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
&quot; then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur , since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet that can &apos;t be recognized as such .
&quot; in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called original compositions , have been added to cities and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; these were created according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying authority between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 , and the first sur@@ veying of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic picture of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Ba@@ war@@ ia map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot;
&quot; the original version for Munich origin@@ ates from 18@@ 56 , and is like all the other on the Bavarian State Library website . &quot;
the comparison of former / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;

&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling lies in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are located around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : a small map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered listings from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; pri@@ ori &quot; &quot; derived from which the property tax was derived . &quot;
small plots are now no more farmers - but a small gar@@ dener of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October f@@ ests , was actually a me@@ adow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the original position paper , in the area of today &apos;s district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , there is not only the street name &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once closed people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich Circle of Ir@@ ren@@ tic@@ ist &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden initiated the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the Ank@@ le of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , it was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ stube in Haar 1905 . &quot;

&quot; on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people now meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments . &quot;
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential houses from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , one erected the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; - in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ene Institution , which was destroyed during World War II in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; Main Place , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke into the city center in December 1944 . &quot;
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel chapel in the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where this day was the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
&quot; with the slider control , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;

&quot; the National Association to promote farmers has issued a warning for colored people , who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will take effect until August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rapid @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; stated in the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;

&quot; the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Ro@@ d Ch@@ apel , the Kansas City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and Death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under frag@@ mentary circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and taken from the Mis@@ sour@@ i Police in custody without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General Public Prosec@@ utor of Mis@@ sour@@ i , where it is shown that black mot@@ orists are being employed in the state 75 percent more frequently than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; Ch@@ apel said . &quot;
people need to be prepared to bring b@@ ail money or let the relatives know they travel through the state .
&quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country . &quot;
travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it harder to sue a company due to housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after states adopted immigration laws allowing local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have adopted the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;

farmers are often critic@@ ised because of the adv@@ ancement of criticism
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ man . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;

now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully orchest@@ rated overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ a Square in Baghdad , in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CNN on the proposals by the President to dras@@ tically restri@@ ct legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ters would have suffered him if he had done it .
&quot; but he took its meaning , and in particular the significance it was attributed to , as the famous poem of Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that lights the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is really right , but as he form@@ ulated it , it isn &apos;t really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the shaking words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , / the poor waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot; &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; ending waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller committed himself not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people were not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the significance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they had a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female embo@@ di@@ ment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and they have a very different name : mother of Ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly as Laz@@ arus has changed the meaning of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big scre@@ aming R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of Johannes the Bap@@ tist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the statue of Liberty had no one invite anyone , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ ator who brought the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
the significance of the statue is quite a question of perception of perception .
&quot; the great ph@@ anta@@ sia act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they saw from the exhausted , poor , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible jour@@ neys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the true sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever want to recognize . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred which is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ oses Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world champ@@ ionships will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland there is something special &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics needs to learn from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we will try to understand it , and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish ath@@ lete think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it &apos;s something to do with what they &apos;ve done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chers - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team to the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought together quite naturally were great .
&quot; the Common@@ wealth @-@ silver medal winner , who will compete with the fifth world champ@@ ionships at the 400 metre hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British crew . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best overall score for athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle @-@ runner Mu@@ ir carries out five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another gr@@ otto , which one should watch after a great season , which was supposed to include the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but also in some cases also with medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special feature of being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chose me , it &apos;s something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it just shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on stage . &quot;
what my speech as a captain is concerned ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to sit on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it &apos;s just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . &quot;
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything , from internal policy to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , sure . &quot;
but he did not put his critics into silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and silent we will be led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Larry Hogan , who has to work more like Washington . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this , therefore , at the beginning of this week . &quot;
&quot; the governor dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
Hogan Lov@@ ells Firm of the Year for Restructuring and Corporate Rescue
this is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Hogan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
&quot; he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state , and strict adher@@ ence to the principles . &quot;
he was also very sk@@ il@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ file his hair @-@ less head for chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum is called officially designated and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokes@@ woman Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the acts of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people , which vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
Hogan Lov@@ ells Firm of the Year for Restructuring and Corporate Rescue
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the past@@ or quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not bot@@ tled , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I was cour@@ te@@ ous that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the comments section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take place on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of citizens affected . &quot;
&quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff called as &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , when one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conduc@@ tivity and to arrest or arrest protesters . &quot;
but exactly that just happens digit@@ ally .

one of the first mil@@ estones in this question last week was in Virginia last week .
&quot; the chairman of the board of supervis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck his leadership . &quot;
&quot; and even at that time , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; Peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with Britain , were overwhel@@ med by the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put them into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance club
&quot; the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for home comfort in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hian is the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who , next year , led to the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the En@@ dr@@ unde , before joining Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reached its fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry has done a great job when he set this place .
he is a di@@ lig@@ ent advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura open , since it was taken from the programme during the year after I had won it . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we always appreciated .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to the promotion on home ground . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad that it has gone so far .

&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; says the director of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not noticeable in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which always ham@@ pers the construction work , is a major problem for the Bau@@ tru@@ pp of the firm St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance of mot@@ orists from red lights and shut @-@ off filters is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; the road is closed , and only the buses are entitled to access . &quot;
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the St@@ ump@@ p company have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use stove . &quot;
they even rarely use a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai domin@@ ance in the troubled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ coal tu@@ ber is filled with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and locks . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless space serves as lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , there were no fields assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work is dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the Hoch@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony that was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 El@@ ders should vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which was stir@@ red up for independence against Dutch domination , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially split into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and made of cor@@ rug@@ ated roof@@ s that were transformed into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a Hoch@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has built a value of 3.1 billion US dollars gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has over wood resources valued at valued 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preser@@ ves an inv@@ ading presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ uan &apos;s demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden G@@ ans and are dealt with mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to the activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
&quot; according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , mass@@ acres in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal high@@ lands were genocide . &quot;

&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since each week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have increased , since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ a@@ wes@@ i . &quot;

&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal inf@@ rin@@ gements in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua , little changed , and today the locals feel dec@@ eived . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we agreed to Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 with expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a fire fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness . &quot;
the shocked children told them that they should turn off their lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took thr@@ ust in their tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and sm@@ ashed the group with their gun @-@ mates , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
&quot; a child , 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ uli@@ anus , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set alight and things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children assembled on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice . &quot;
&quot; they wore cerem@@ onial hunting @-@ hun@@ ts , and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in circle and a bird song im@@ i@@ ding - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe . &quot;
some demonstr@@ ators began to smug@@ gle stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official document of TIME , which was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ minent danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TIME on the por@@ ch of his multic@@ ol@@ oured wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ e still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only wears a name , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;

&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;

&quot; I hid myself two days in my house .
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to withdraw the officers involved in the account and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile brig@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ bb@@ ish for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ land of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the Free Pap@@ ua Movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by sending spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some dive again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as far as reach .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of the women , each with four or five fields of the sweet potato . &quot;
&quot; they retain the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 ind@@ ones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic inequality between the native Pap@@ ua and the new immigrants has grown since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region generally go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua seldom have capital or the necessary skills to compete for their own company .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission to film was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
a lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Pal@@ au , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the allegations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to know this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; according to a source , who also participated in the meeting but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chair@@ woman of the tribe . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the permanent threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in spite of threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot victims led to a final symbolic act of the law : the body of a victim was buried in front of the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus says with his head . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the second time , fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time &quot;
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which takes place in just two years through the high @-@ rise , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor , &quot; &quot; told a resident named George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled off the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
&quot; the incident may include questions about safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world . &quot;
&quot; a study carried out by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by cl@@ adding , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believed that the system of plates to isol@@ ate and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen out with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , a proposal for this sport was to play the Davis Cup single only to two winning sets , not spar@@ ed by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so much valued five @-@ set classics remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David H@@ agger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members don &apos;t accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said H@@ agger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; not only for the vote , after many in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies , the proposal has already come to fill the final at a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller , so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right next year in the first round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training places , etc . , will be facilit@@ ated and players will need less official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;

critics had repeatedly pointed out that there was only non @-@ binding bookings .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays € 1000 ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in Great Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation deposit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present , 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are available , as Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of some 12 percent of all orders could be solved . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 84@@ .000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be joined - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there is about 1800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; in the second half of 2018 , whoever orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la succe@@ eds , his brand new , never tested in practice @-@ tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to larger delays , the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from entering into Sch@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; in former administ@@ rations , the EPA has often not observed the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and in an agreement prec@@ eded the deadline for carrying out , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compla@@ ined the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA &apos;s opinion suggested that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legal procedures available to ensure that the rules &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive re @-@ audit of o@@ zone rules .
a draft bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 Rules of 2015 for at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth charity ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters tum@@ ours to their concerns .
&quot; Walter Martini says : &quot; &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ liche Klein@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Wür@@ tt@@ ember@@ g@@ ische Ur@@ lich Book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church on Tum@@ lingen including the Vog@@ ue &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the former parish church , the wor@@ ding of the document stood at the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church , which belonged to the church or the patron &apos;s right and not vice versa . &quot;
so also people lived there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , in addition to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the village image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement centre of the village . &quot;
old maps from time around 1600 reflect these historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ ate law was created from early medieval equity .
&quot; a gent@@ leman , who built a church and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this owner &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the right to use a priest or to propose a new past@@ or to the Bishop . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two is engraved on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly installed bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over to the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) , windows were inserted and the bell parts were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aky .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops enc@@ amp@@ ed near the church . &quot;
&quot; they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church , and used it as fire@@ wood . &quot;
the remains of the church threatened to pl@@ unge in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 23 , the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 2 ) 2,@@ 7@@ 64 295 &quot;
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm broke the bell tower and half fell . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
only the tower @-@ z@@ wer@@ g still existing today remained as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em nur@@ tured the Hil@@ arius system as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as an organis@@ er , the friends and supporters tum@@ our on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
&quot; on the other hand , there is no doubt that this is the case . &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is 15 : 30 p.m .
&quot; to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view of meadows towards the forest , &quot; the organizers put out the fantastic view . &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of significance for tum@@ ours and audi@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the friends and supporters of Tum@@ bl@@ r are particularly committed to the care of home care , such as ser@@ en@@ ade organiz@@ er Walter Martini . &quot;

it is illegal to be illegal .
&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbin@@ es could have been approved in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the time in Vier@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy plants are generally possible , but at the same time , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind power utilization for the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette - but the district government Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a defect . &quot;

city and retailer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Langen@@ sal@@ a and people from the region will discover shopping opportunities in the city centre . &quot;
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the residents to the shopping spre@@ e into the city centre .
&quot; like the Chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; weekend is to sensi@@ tise customers that offers their own city away from the usual supermarkets . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags which point to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; in this way , the industrial society and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive inner city . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ ten@@ se , including sales @-@ based Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and host to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre when shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; in the spring , it would be possible to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network which was partly broad@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should be adverti@@ sed for the appreciation of local trade and make its meaning for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
&quot; the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes clear that each citizen can influence his direct environment , with his purchase behaviour . &quot;

&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury passed through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;

&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ ams torn the silence as a young black man was drag@@ ged by the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , played on July 22 , is only a post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of the audience attracted a very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , Bürger@@ recht@@ ler moved back to Moore &apos;s Ford bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - were v@@ owed by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ concei@@ vable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks said in the organisation of post @-@ ordination . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former member of the State of Georgia and a life long civil rights activist .
&quot; for him , the post@@ ure serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe Community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to prosec@@ ute , we want to end , we want to cure , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice .
&quot; a court medical officer lays a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding gra@@ f@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ burg trial . &quot;
but none was ever tried .
&quot; although the suspects remain free on foot for decades , citizen rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to leave their vote at the pre @-@ election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI &apos;s FBI agent Roger Mal@@ com has a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our was in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison paid 600 dollars to release Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they came closer to the prison and drew near to the Moore &apos;s Ford bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b enc@@ ir@@ cled the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the murder , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , removed evidence and dec@@ eived the identity of witnesses . &quot;

they work in several places in their volunte@@ ering year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; a lot : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I &apos;ll help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked in the open all day at the school .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; a lot : it &apos;s a beautiful , broad spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late volunteer volunteer . &quot;
how does that come from ?
there are no translations available .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , we have successfully broken off . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it &apos;s the wrong way for me , and I want to do something else to work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sciences in the winter semester .
&quot; I &apos;m going to study dual , probably in youth unemployment benefit from a social worker education and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different sites during the volunte@@ ering service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;

&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing I &apos;ve traveled .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
other than in engineering studies ?
&quot; a lot : well , here it is not about to calculate static charges . &quot;
&quot; there are always other people in front of the head , each having a completely different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; if a refugee if a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family , must always be taken individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
there is a lot : I don &apos;t have the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is . &quot;

&quot; the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement of Nato , it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; persons carried on impro@@ vised explosive devices &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and will be treated in the U.S. military hospital on the B@@ agram air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian casu@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most lethal militant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump has weak@@ ened the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bomb@@ ings in Kabul in the last few weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , politics , and particularly in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA re@@ jects decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , according to which states are committed to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to prop@@ el the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 , &quot; and said they are showing the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in part of the country should be measured , to determine where sections must be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Columbia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to withdraw a wide range of environmental claims that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump should boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of demo@@ crats and nature groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as as@@ thma . &quot;

&quot; however , it will continue until the area belonging to the church community has so far been in the community , but there is now no planning obstacle to the project from a private investor to lift up the project . &quot;
there is a discussion about a community space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council ho@@ ver in front of such a common space not as a meeting point only for the residents of the living @-@ just living , but open to the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word of the &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; made the round . &quot;

the building is located in the refur@@ bishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a community space would be , thus , T@@ j@@ ades reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal sees to signal the investor to indicate that in this regard , there is no kne@@ eling between the legs , suggesting that both the saddle and the surrounding environment - as well as P@@ ult@@ dach - would be reduced and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; not necessary , so not only Wilfried Soh@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings , with which you don &apos;t get so right , you can now sit in the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I am very concerned with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely opposed to communal involvement .
&quot; on the other hand , it sees a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy on already wealthy or even foreign investors . &quot;

four injured after tyre plac@@ er

&quot; the car led to the em@@ bank@@ ment right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it was over@@ thrown and then on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the last rescue service , the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour , afterwards the traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
&quot; Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ising the defense formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , though not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to fit in au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge , the tri@@ erk@@ ats should also be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a fre@@ eway , the mar@@ vel doesn &apos;t want to catch any more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ensing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is able to better cope with the experience in preparation with the triple chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; &quot; because we &apos;re just in the tri@@ but@@ ary at the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ elmann Players who can build well , &quot; &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; this is a prer@@ equis@@ ite , but that we are still more harmon@@ ious and we don &apos;t do so many mistakes in building . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you are able to talk about a mis@@ chiev@@ ous start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we have four points on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer did not want to know anything about it .
&quot; after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el &quot; , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who didn &apos;t want to talk of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken off due to an im@@ position . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the player from Au@@ e might even be somewhat fre@@ sher as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a climbing favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , guests from the Rhin@@ eland are going to meet in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadi@@ ums of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the fact that we take them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is stupid , &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there are no teams in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; says Fort@@ un@@ as chief coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so spark@@ le doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .

&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 per cent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for Foren@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ tt@@ s@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) began to perform tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , you should make a more precise estimate of age after the Swedish migration authority ( migration disgu@@ ised ) has been critic@@ ised for mistakes in judging the correct age of some refugees who were under age . &quot;
&quot; until today , migration short@@ falls 6,@@ 8@@ 80 have been sent to test cases and the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in more 25 cases the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency found that the person was &quot; &quot; possibly 18 years or older &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results in recent months are consistent . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics last month , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person was judged more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases indicating that the person examined 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det was investigating the results published in 5@@ 81 , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of the medical age assessment , with X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of cre@@ ases that are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
skep@@ tics is the endo@@ kr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of taking a child as an adult is low . &quot;

&quot; it is not so common that parties move to a strand , but if it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , F@@ WG , Left ) are part of a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully in this day because the Af@@ D invites to the &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ Americans , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking underneath the R@@ ond@@ ola - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colourful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forums One World and one of the major organizers , is really pleased : &quot; &quot; great how many people here come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;

West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection ... today , I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se Hillary Clinton &apos;s democratic candidate . &quot;
&quot; according to For@@ bes , Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he owns coal in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
he is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republican National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;

&quot; the world leader in athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be taken back to the sport . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ y@@ la@@ kh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite its comments , IA@@ AF agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the Rep@@ orters . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised that it has experienced some quite hot days and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;

&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp imprint .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ vor@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs char@@ s . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all , what we currently know is a health haz@@ ard practically impossible . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ? &quot;
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; if the deficit levels of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg are exceeded , these are not traffic @-@ capable . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time not the factories are to blame .
are production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current level of knowledge , the production companies do not meet immediate guilt . &quot;

&quot; as always , there are too little controllers in the harvest . &quot;
is there a lack of staff or even the conc@@ lusive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that took the process .
&quot; however , the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; I have already made several distinc@@ tions , that I expect a complete clari@@ fication of the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular alert of al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food processing ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and safe food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; by means of the controlled funds , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the post@@ ure of food @-@ safe animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
&quot; on all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure . &quot;

how the financial rules of football match to N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will still come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UE@@ FA , as the leading organisation controlling the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , established in 2011 by UE@@ FA , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to purchase the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make the money loose with security , so that N@@ ey@@ mar is signing and bringing him into a gal@@ ax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the teams through the energy @-@ rich rulers of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations may apply for a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be counter@@ acted with legitimate revenue sources , which enable them to enable the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UE@@ FA president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively dec@@ eived and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners returned to their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the liabilities of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ mo@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year period of the FF@@ P pre @-@ ageing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UE@@ FA successor , Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to dis@@ courage excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P in the UE@@ FA , compared to The Associated Press in the last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the budget can be exp@@ elled for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.6 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fin@@ er of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later reduced to 20 million euros , and it was ordered that the team members voted for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UE@@ FA is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ list their financial supervis@@ ors by bl@@ aming their income by companies , who are associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UE@@ FA decided that the sponsor of the PS@@ A was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a portion of the PS@@ G payments could come to N@@ ey@@ mar by payments of the World Cup 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disputed that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup Ambass@@ adors will be able to figure out such maneu@@ vers for the UE@@ FA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UE@@ FA will still be more atten@@ tive to consider any attempt to avoid the rules .
&quot; the UE@@ FA had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke of the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million a profit of more than € 10 million .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .

&quot; the Spanish League was clearly mistaken , one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by a club . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the finan@@ cially fair@@ play because there are different ways , or have different interests , if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;

No@@ stal@@ gie goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade detective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ ehler and Paul Ru@@ dd go to larger matters . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally par@@ ody and embo@@ di@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ able era permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as a franchise , it feels like the time is scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a pleasant can vegetable , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; on the core of the g@@ ag @-@ sti@@ ff@@ ening - middle @-@ aged actor in middle ages , the children who grow up - still create the im@@ possibility of reg@@ ain@@ ing the last part of the wi@@ dow . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody is more after the fo@@ undry , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cradle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand That rocks the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; one point is a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some Inline Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lov@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now novel@@ ist , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy evil plot , involved in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the franchise . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the ever@@ lasting young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ side@@ of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of acci@@ dental del@@ usion that could stimulate the Franchise as a kind of repe@@ ating &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I consider as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Com@@ rade detective &quot; has now re@@ members a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West Ring@@ kampf @-@ icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , is a drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a tough @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alist I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose dialog@@ ues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be syn@@ ced to English . &quot;
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to view ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade detective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer , who wears a Re@@ agan mask , becomes involved - that it is often like a single one . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase .
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish &quot; &quot; when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with less members in this month , as the weak economic growth weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; however , they sign@@ aled that interest increases would be necessary in the coming years to boost inflation from the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the mam@@ mot@@ h economic package that was issued a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it will be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak short @-@ term , since the pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain stra@@ pping of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool down inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; degree than expected markets . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , the Bank emphasized that increases &quot; &quot; incre@@ ments &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; would be made . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on a rise in interest rate and GDP in the second quarter rose 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and marginal increase , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing will first be worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years could not &quot; &quot; prevent the break of income &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year plan were &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pounds . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the bank &apos;s final verdict , the call for interest rates rose to a rise since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July to increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be re@@ introduced in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that exceeding its goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot;

patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV pre@@ vent@@ ative treatment from September onwards .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ posi@@ tivity phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of App@@ eal confirmed that the Court of App@@ eal confirmed that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p , despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday announced , N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens was gre@@ eted as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first to make the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ oper@@ atory phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV @-@ drugs that are taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in inf@@ ectious diseases .
pre@@ p before sexual inter@@ course means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
&quot; those who come to question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who were not treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to evaluate the full potential of Pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is targeted and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; Stev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; This great new intervention should supplement the far reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV and over@@ take it . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades sustained progress in cop@@ ing one of humanity &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pre@@ p , when targeted specifically to people and endanger@@ ed people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September , people with high HIV @-@ risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to improving many , many lives . &quot;
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now lie that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been acquired , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Sharon Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the Pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delay . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect individuals who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
&quot; living : mezzanine and clever designer tricks , this small Ear@@ ls Court Apartment turns into a spacious home &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet of the apartment have been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a conce@@ aled layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne Storage room and a mezzanine to optim@@ ally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; to this end , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were pil@@ ed over each other , without having to wi@@ den ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but placing the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement allowed the fan to place two rooms at full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous residential area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ lin lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; on both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance we offer pi@@ ped units , place for all the cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little engineering art went inside , &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter @-@ important so that when you move the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here they managed to increase the floor area , and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional attachment in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love you in the electric so@@ ckets in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;

&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation with one of the largest real estate empire of Vict@@ ori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &quot; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation with the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Colin - by Paul described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul roughly one third . &quot;
a court record states that this means that Colin &apos;s property worth $ 316 million and Paul is worth $ 176 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a major problem for Paul .
&quot; the proposed sub@@ stitu@@ tions from Colin suggested to him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claimed , ruled him . &quot;
&quot; Colin argues that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ it , submitted by Colin , he says , he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance says that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs are in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ its , emails and reports of companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both sides held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen business from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Colin was opened the first shop of the family . &quot;
&quot; Colin says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to give her property further to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in front of the court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke are not part of the De Lu@@ tis Group group , with Colin said that Mark had to pay $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars in leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;

&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and move our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not wish that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he still hopes for a solution . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; Colin wrote . &quot;
umps of new Chief of Staff plans to restri@@ ct the President &apos;s media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media , hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece of rep@@ orters Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff at his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House he wanted to repair : bad information falling into the president &apos;s hands . &quot;
&quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship to television last decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Can@@ didate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of jobs that were to convince him , &quot; said former electoral campaig@@ ner Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; OK , now I just want BF1918 /
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter habit ever was under control is ridicul@@ ous .
maybe these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ umps Twe@@ ets without their interventions have contained even more ignition .
we probably never know about the tweets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his staff tried to keep the anger away from him several times , their efforts were worth it . &quot;
but nobody has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump controversy .
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a white house composed of competing parties will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material , which may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the advis@@ ors of the consultants , the president for strategic reasons , dubi@@ ous information . &quot;
this was an example described by Reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcan@@ o to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that it is sti@@ ff@@ ly to find out where they origin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the President of malicious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provoc@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ smith added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; maybe he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .

travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire Series &apos;
&quot; some of the most wealthy land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on the foot of war , who have negoti@@ ated a ridge from the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their manor houses . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avan on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire Series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch from the Council to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense equipment and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; fur@@ ious residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous land@@ lord said , &quot; &quot; They were moved there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced by shame for implementation , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today even more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my community service , if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot;
&quot; a local residents who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just have only seen the last round of these travelers just to be pill@@ aged by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and one has even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the land beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to move forward as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we proceed our case . &quot;

&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ dium commen@@ ced at the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of new revel@@ ations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;

&quot; at 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for man is not going out of him .
&quot; according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the ice age . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
now the broken pist@@ ol has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
&quot; it grows constantly into the sea , and breaks down regularly . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
&quot; North of this Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ses , the balance of growth was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On February 9 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets , &lt; 7 &quot; &quot; Tablets , Android &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can break down , if at a key point a piece breaks down . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as they float on the water and pushed ice as much water as it produces after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the ice bucket contributes to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in small dimensions , the British research project on the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in Ant@@ arc@@ tica , according to A@@ WI . &quot;
&quot; at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back again or fall back in the long term , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not lead the demolition of this giant ic@@ eberg to climate change , many ice @-@ d@@ war@@ fs of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have been broken down in recent decades . &quot;
this long skirt of Ant@@ arc@@ tica stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
&quot; for the decline , the temperature rise has contributed . &quot;
&quot; the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has heated around three degrees in the last 50 years , and t@@ ames the areas where the temperature is the fastest way . &quot;

&quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had monitored the boat of &apos; Youth Rescue &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is suspected that his crew will take infl@@ atable boat migrants , which can be delivered directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the smug@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one of these meetings took place only 1.3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a have to board an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have been prepared to keep their code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Arms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be as unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Minn@@ iti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local ci@@ vic leaders have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;

&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been subjected to mal@@ nutrition . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sentenced to life in June due to negli@@ gent killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his voc@@ ation .
&quot; she was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; in red pants and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor of the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ters attorney admitted that it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she regre@@ tt@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he didn &apos;t find out that her age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain that we will carry for etern@@ ity with us to be for his sisters , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted by the recognition &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit suicide , commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a car in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , walk yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad , &quot; and &quot; Everything you need to do is switch to the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few who defended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convicted in 2007 for murder on her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot;

European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen ox@@ ides , em@@ it diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for automobile manufacturers , equipment to neutr@@ alise the exhaust gases exposed to diesel vehicles , also take too , which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of bl@@ aming the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies attempt to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions when a car was tested , but driving under normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to deal with the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been extended . &quot;

&quot; Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 , as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires . &quot;
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he found himself as an artist for congrat@@ ulation cards - which fru@@ strated him . &quot;

&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the C@@ RI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endanger@@ ed , because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the spring and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transfers di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;

&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant o@@ ats with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

&quot; there is no rest of violence , and while the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 , after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now , there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her in@@ spir@@ ator from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two rep@@ orters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although in 2010 a Son@@ der @-@ Federal Attorney Office was established to edit the cases of journalists , this was only initiated by the Committee for Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the murder@@ ers of journalists are rarely prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ separ@@ able and even though the terrain is still more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we miss everyone . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; &quot; Zw@@ öl@@ dner &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ours tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornam@@ ented , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums of drug king@@ doms that are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranqu@@ ility &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
&quot; in spite of the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , broke out that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; at first , the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el groups in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , pres@@ umed gang@@ ster members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was unable to force Val@@ dez , following the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .

&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journalism without viol@@ ating the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the paper earned a reputation for cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising took place . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ orters would love to be able to publish hard @-@ looking investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else would dare to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever she conducted . &quot;
he gave up volun@@ tar@@ ily that he had fear .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you must take the task that you stum@@ ble as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many mur@@ ders ... why did you not tell what went ahead ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ß@@ vo@@ gel , who was able to cur@@ b as a do@@ ve worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted on his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sitting at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for a routine ?
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret startup and run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
&quot; if it &apos;s wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mix of lu@@ cra@@ tive smug@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones were suddenly allowed . days before was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ sized district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in a joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who called the Gover@@ nor himself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the reporter went into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was born on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had a exposure to the state spending , concentrated on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it was done , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite locally by drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled by the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the reader would have seen Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the most informative source of the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his sl@@ ender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
journalist Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ voc@@ ate disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mic@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot;
journalists have become more lou@@ der throughout the country by written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
&quot; this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; in a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy journalists and release them because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she is re @-@ parti@@ tioned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces , who cont@@ ested the organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media group &quot; artic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of blogger Mary Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; here I am due to my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were lying next to their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assass@@ ination of the correspondent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue to make El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed the drug cart@@ els with a leading article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for haz@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue to work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was reporter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce were sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drinking beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ mon . &quot;
a number of found@@ ries with belt riv@@ als and security forces near Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as it was promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the board , they released the news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website via mobile phone . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens were nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch , to see if they were in read@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; if they were scared at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to ev@@ ade his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , if also a fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable r@@ hin@@ oc@@ er@@ os of a Canadian mining worker have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had had something of an &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the world &apos;s best din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , which lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredible well @-@ preserved condition has surprised researchers , who describe it as &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; , &quot; stun@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the pan@@ de@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something , which seemed out of the surrounding rocks , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage in order to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a screen technology used as a counter@@ f@@ eit , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to interfere in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , indicating that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made headlines in May and now is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers now have studied the wild animal and it is called B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techni@@ cian Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to uncover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ our over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although cont@@ acting is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs hun@@ ted from sufficient pressure by meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the vei@@ ling of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals who use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of roe , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , what sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the Krei@@ de@@ zeit , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red brown .
HZ@@ I researchers discover control centres in Y@@ ers@@ inia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and drove into the sea , where it sank on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as south fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans probably spread far more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ genital skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintaining the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just play a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the Krei@@ de@@ zeit was a time when huge thermal periods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , went through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the King of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tonnes of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and mum@@ mi@@ fied in mud mum@@ mi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely removed from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were weigh@@ ed on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es that moved from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ de@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters have been s@@ war@@ med by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the building blocks are still covered along the din@@ osau@@ r along the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates that bear the skull of the animal .

&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is called the railway ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;

and you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .
&quot; by Andrzej On November 2 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets , &lt; 7 &quot; &quot; Tablets , Android &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : one climb@@ s into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
&quot; the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices , that passenger X is located in the train and taken the seat Y &apos;s booked seat . &quot;
he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which in turn will benefit passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel without a ticket check through our train esc@@ ort , the DB navig@@ ator is simply checking out yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Chief Marketing Officer of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;

&quot; either the credit card or the identity card , or otherwise a document that you have to as@@ sign . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train associates and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling one &apos;s own tickets and takes the Schaff@@ ner at the end of the time to take care of other matters . &quot;

&quot; there were photos of police tape and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a shield with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; they watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , another police officer assured his rifle and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have used to and which we can call typical .
at this moment I felt shaking frost .
&quot; I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house , and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ uson next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ uson , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , who are living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; when Fer@@ rell , with her daughter , wore a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ uson , both had a conversation that she had inn@@ um@@ erable times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you , when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t take them with them , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what is happening today is a cli@@ max of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be drawn up .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally doesn &apos;t experience any ec@@ centric racism , she is not unlike the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I feel , I would give her a bad service to keep them away from af@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , who became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;

they prepared bags and helped them to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to document &quot; &quot; docum@@ enting &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; We had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community that com@@ eth together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life , as she falls in love and her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ Lives@@ Matter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main load of all . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , she insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; where Fer@@ rell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the for@@ efront , because in a life on these cros@@ sings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen .
&quot; in the meantime , the cameras in F@@ erg@@ uson have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway in a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ut@@ ches on a song and she feels obliged to remember that since she went to F@@ erg@@ uson three years ago in F@@ erg@@ uson . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , although they haven &apos;t been built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping center on the south of the pedestrian zone divi@@ des the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold Sp@@ ecks Thees Uhlmann
&quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the theme is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t have a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents of building a gallery attract more customers into the city , including the other shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of construction work , it will be concluded . &quot;
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Bed@@ a Square with an opportunity to sit outside .
&quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; we have been buying the farm market for many years now . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the rural women are always welcome . &quot;
we discovered a but@@ cher shop for us too .
&quot; we would like that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to sustain this offer . &quot;
&quot; in other cities , there is also this . &quot;
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether direct marketing moves in a market hall in the gallery , depends on the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On February 9 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets , &lt; 7 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping spre@@ es in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
&quot; you can see how many shops are empty here , some for months and years . &quot;
&quot; but since there is not a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained . &quot;
&quot; after all , the product offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is priced at the top . &quot;
&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; it is a pity , special stores are almost no longer there and that , which is still left , will probably disappear . &quot;
&quot; Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit me together . &quot;
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where is the farm market hall planned during construction time ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the spec@@ tre bit gallery before to exp@@ el all the shops from Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; that won &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping centre , which stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a correct peasant market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farm market hall , thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place . &quot;
&quot; if the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ mistak@@ ably identical - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts provided by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analyst was a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being classified as secret diplomatic messages on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline is her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and a pioneering student whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations , but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman , was sentenced to 20 counts in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ fie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly seated on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ t and chew@@ ing gum by extra@@ cting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she couldn &apos;t visit this time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use were un@@ equal , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o &apos;s &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President Chel@@ azz@@ i would convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Obama actually had a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there are also now at the opening of the exhibition some deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths that he should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg asked for the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things from a particular reason happen . &quot;
&quot; in one of the artistic statements written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called on her superior signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hoping to show the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the highly developed scientific ency@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people hope to take with us is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also has to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own room , is a page from the comic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le mentioned above . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing as she emerg@@ es with a free @-@ talk @-@ ef@@ on in hand out of the discipline of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; if they keep your speech cool , then they have won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ eted from Philadelphia . &quot;
I always get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room from the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ les that merge into hor@@ des of prot@@ ection@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this was also target @-@ oriented , as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ ist groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot;

&quot; a nationwide human @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who will be searched as suspects after a man has been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;

&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; a public warning system , published by the Chicago Police Authority , states that the body was discovered on July 27 . &quot;
&quot; officials received a phone call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au has still been declared dead , and det@@ ectives investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while police are actively searching for the two suspects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ b@@ age , the Vice @-@ President of University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them was now being judged and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ b@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokesman of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain , and ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he was demanding the suspects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a enig@@ matic tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .

it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza issued an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ AD@@ A ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the timet@@ able , R@@ US@@ AD@@ A has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ en@@ forcing R@@ US@@ AD@@ A and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and W@@ AD@@ A in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation carried out by the W@@ AD@@ A by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ ous words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;

&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only in@@ serts . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .

&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action .
&quot; indeed , when a company asks employees after your feedback , there may be a expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have been very interested in collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you aren &apos;t going to follow people , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Reed , who now runs monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem was reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ rett . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ strated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets a glimpse of the employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better bon@@ ding of employees in an industry that is known for high sales . &quot;
&quot; if you are not bound to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;

&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their Tri@@ kot@@ express parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these minutes are a lunch break . &quot;
players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three hour practice before they return to the Water Man Football Center next morning .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tread@@ mill , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; this is why the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 , in order to meet the already packed sched@@ ules of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
&quot; in the course of August 18 , they are supposed to hold 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal play preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said he under@@ scored the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ated on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to the Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is completed , as soon as the camp is termin@@ ated , which has been thrown out by the clear sigh@@ ting of its fields from an adjacent parking area and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been thrown out with foot@@ balls , which will be no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room and then set up an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video and exercise of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;

creating a comic @-@ novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980 . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Bew@@ l River Valley in Kent , and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; the time from the Middle Ages up to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted on the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who was working for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters cre@@ ep into smoke , for they lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself was involved . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who has been beaten so with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated welcome greeting ) , &quot; it seems all too nice to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , watching the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he tran@@ k &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he referred to as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter into the English history , including &apos; The lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar who entered the castle in 13@@ 80 in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of Kent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought , an insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher that the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , portra@@ yed by the smug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the guys seemed to be quite G@@ aun@@ er , always doing debts and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men extingu@@ ish their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic @-@ novel about E@@ lä@@ hä@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ tra@@ cted from nature since then . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;

military Re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ ogan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , Ankara the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so this week .
&quot; at first glance , a normal procedure . &quot;
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after Putin &apos;s attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Minister , as well as the Minister of Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs , took part in the consult@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the number of numbers . &quot;
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; Secretary of General Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the navy have been removed . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ ogan as wi@@ dow of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 48@@ 6 people who were directly involved in the coup attempt , it is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the eve of the coup , Erd@@ ogan had called the overthrow of a &quot; God gift , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erd@@ ogan really hold the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scarf ban for soldiers , the newspaper wrote . &quot;
&quot; posted in English , International , Sea Control , Sea Powers &#124; Tagged aircraft carrier , China , Marine , Navy , Sea Control , Sea Control , Sea Powers , Security Policy &#124; Leave a comment &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ ogan was firing more than 73@@ 95 state servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as though Erd@@ ogan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were used earlier than the actual masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ ogan urged the military to step up step by step , not least under the appeal of the European Union &apos;s reform proposals . &quot;
&quot; former officers say , Erd@@ ogan drives an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces . &quot;
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; , &quot; an officer who was seeking asylum after the coup attempt from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army would be &quot; &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot;

Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by the US will change the way the citizens will be issued from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;

the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought that 2017 will not be even more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robot is coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking her climb seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the nipp@@ le and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun about them , but the companies deliver lots of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ ul@@ tures have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone @-@ skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , and choose anything from the eye color of the robot to the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ anders have developed to robots with a silicone .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing , such as pup@@ il tern@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed characters such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; the True Compan@@ ion website war@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the allegations of rape if one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah goes , rest@@ less one most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is compatible with a vibr@@ ator on his website , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing sophistic@@ ation point towards something Dun@@ cl@@ er and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will naturally not keep sex robots , while the FR@@ R noted their increasing popularity , however , they remain at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what se@@ eps out of the edge zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or offensive , until the free market gives permission to them . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House , who has been pra@@ ising women sex@@ ually . &quot;
&quot; the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the swal@@ lowed body and the ej@@ ected eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gil@@ ead is a jump , but at the moment it doesn &apos;t feel like a great leap . &quot;
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ blan@@ ce to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with porn star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human feeling that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , at the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companions or simply walk away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that could interfere with independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maid girl
Tr@@ ump &apos;s big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a binding wisdom of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era , that the political divisions , who have pol@@ arized the U.S. elect@@ orate , have divided families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving Day , newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump &apos;s chosen relatives . &quot;
we all said to us to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power Tr@@ umps , to bring together families . &quot;
&quot; I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ minded poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everybody knows whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely independently on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dep@@ lo@@ ying effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his bis@@ cuits of one day will no longer be cast off . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; today , I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s age @-@ old version of the fall - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked out ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild criminal . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump moves , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the New York &apos;s Park Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are sn@@ ack@@ ly and the animals rotate to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely glo@@ omy and the clim@@ atic music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I still haven &apos;t been across the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park carousel , however , is still a strange magical experience since two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can walk on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have voted the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;

&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your di@@ gestive system like a nightmare .
&quot; however , a new study confirms the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the inc@@ urable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mp@@ s and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody diarr@@ he@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually advised to alle@@ vi@@ ate meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found out that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helped to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , declared that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food cannot penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the equ@@ ilibrium is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , a type of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice is found that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines . &quot;
bacteria of the@@ Y@@ ers@@ ini@@ agen@@ us el@@ ic@@ it intestinal wall@@ inflamm@@ ation@@ and serious diarr@@ ho@@ eal disease as well as other afflic@@ tions in humans . this gen@@ us includes the@@ pl@@ ague path@@ ogen .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ il@@ lus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a rich diet toler@@ ates rich diet toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mili@@ eus , if the same system also happens in humans . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ do@@ ktor@@ an@@ din Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell , which promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same stem , but it was not accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ologists of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in ster@@ ile environment so that they were lacking an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria were applied to the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same toler@@ ancing cells like mice , and that most of us have L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tra@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of this population .

the costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands of thousands of dollars
&quot; the decision of the White House to fly a Marine helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that highlighted American production last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers charged according to the military subject to the TIME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House , made a tour through products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter was built in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a fork @-@ lift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office requested the helicopter &apos;s presence in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to know that you are aware of this because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superior commander , the Deputy Navy commander for aviation . &quot;
the news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and remained until the lawn has been vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restri@@ ction of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event during the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the air@@ plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required . &quot;
&quot; the Hat@@ ch Act prohi@@ bits federal , state property for political purposes . &quot;
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the purpose .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hat@@ ch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hat@@ ch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus to reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to ins@@ ure government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically adv@@ anta@@ geous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
presi@@ dents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February , when the Presi@@ dential aircraft delivered in front of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential plane by its predec@@ essors . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the Show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often cause training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the U.S. President in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ ers .
&quot; as a dr@@ ump in the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led by the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted among the training needs of the flight crew for the month , a official said . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicopter units flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers paid the burden to none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved to put helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not hold bud@@ get@@ ary records for the presi@@ dency , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event . &quot;

the White House argues that the actual cost of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for the refund sets is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the replacement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and the conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press secretary of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump interven@@ ed with helicopter when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he set himself in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and talked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; with fixed contacts for the children , and an assignment to the team . &quot;
&quot; in the urban nur@@ series , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal children &apos;s day care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ate , deputy head of the department of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we were very pleased . &quot;
December : 10 items &#124; November : 3 items &#124; August : 17 items &#124; May : 5 items &#124; April : 3 items &#124; March : 6 items &#124; February : 5 items &#124; January : 8 items &#124; Year : 2007
&quot; the city operates 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the Cre@@ tan area , in 44 children will receive a warm meal during lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children sat on the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are car@@ ed for 45 hours , at the K@@ ita , explains Pom@@ mer@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour assistance , if children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;

&quot; the employees are permanently assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ o says . &quot;

&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for the management to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons . &quot;
children should help prepare meals .
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .

&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm , which has proved to be the most economical one in the cost comparison between self @-@ governing and foreign capital for the city . &quot;

G@@ MB Scotland said the company was weighing over the future of investments in the T@@ oll@@ crossing location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , besides other products , Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich tea cookies . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ tie owner Pla@@ di said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; first experience &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company manager of the company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie said , &quot; &quot; To express concern that financing for moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can not gain clarity on business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members deeply . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the prospect of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urg@@ ently a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ di said : &quot; &quot; the company leader at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with colleagues and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we operate like all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and in@@ secure economic climate , constantly checking our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross plant , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ crossing as a production site fully and completely . if our operations are changing at the location , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti regre@@ en
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar after having submitted an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve his release clause , but did they warned Barcelona three years before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record for more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sport@@ sman of the world . PS@@ G offers more than 500,000 GBP a week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way out outside , although a source near the Catal@@ an insur@@ rection is that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned of the PS@@ G presi@@ dency three years ago before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di &apos;s signature , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not permit it to the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was submitted by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with the education officer Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victim of over@@ prints , 67 domain spar@@ rows sex@@ ually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other accused , many victims under@@ estimated the overall humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories with him are connected with him . &quot;

&quot; Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence exercise at the shel@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students raise their &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ection@@ ist , who became more tangible in the audience when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read the whole 440 pages of long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found in it . &quot;
he has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of the complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
&quot; on the other hand , violence ex@@ ams at the pre@@ school took place outside of its sphere of influence . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to repro@@ ach him at best , to get out of it too late or to have taken the first hints seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the dom@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um , which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respondents as - as liter@@ al - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also portra@@ ys him as &quot; warm@@ heart@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding &quot; as a very good teacher , who regularly supplied the boys with cake , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always lag@@ ged by the grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about its perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; he himself had already admitted , deeply regre@@ tt@@ ed , deeply regre@@ tt@@ ed and ap@@ ologi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be said that educational methods were widely used in the early 1960s and 1970s , with parents such as teachers . &quot;
do you know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also have experienced this in a secular school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually about in this report , namely the horri@@ fying sexual abuse and violence of violence at the pre@@ school , this is true of Bag@@ at@@ ellen . &quot;
&quot; as a result , you wonder if it is not more likely to do with his reputation and role as a brother of Benedict XVI , that many media have just jumped on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him are still busy . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger placed in the final report also any involvement or complic@@ ity in relation to sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : clearly no .

not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a spokesperson for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was , however , that most victims were silent . &quot;
&quot; if they did not even trust their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , they certainly did not have a ch@@ oral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;

Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ able student said : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had timely insights and could hold the relevant perpet@@ rator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , to assume that all of all of that ... bub@@ bles intru@@ sive or clear@@ er or more likely to have opened than opposite their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ory directors , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the report concludes with the clear result : &quot; &quot; that the pup@@ il and / or their environment were entru@@ sted to him in advance , could not be confirmed during the examination . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore acqu@@ itted of every competitor . &quot;

&quot; therefore there is no reason to link its good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it was unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; &quot; violence ex@@ termination &quot; &quot; was read in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking out &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
do you have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence ex@@ tor@@ tion and somewhere in the middle of the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; but exactly this is , in turn , a mis@@ use of the report . &quot;
&quot; there , namely , clean@@ up : between the pre@@ school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence ex@@ termination , we say once and other allegations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from time since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the head of the Cathedral @-@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole horrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were sti@@ pul@@ ated and painted and suffered , were all at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do with them , because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the dom@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; this was , like most of the witnesses , emphas@@ ised the theme &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heav@@ enly &quot; conditions .
what was different from the dom@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was discipline , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the overall humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
&quot; posted on January 30 , 2014 &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre@@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he started to establish himself , and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently lock the ears in front of the conditions ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral secondary school , which the report was even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he points out that in the pre@@ school , the punishment will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended an urgent step . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course at a time , as legal clarity , as an investig@@ ative pun@@ ish@@ ments in Bavaria were long ago banned . &quot;
&quot; in front of it , they were in a legal gray zone , like each of us still knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult to estimate for him , where the suff@@ er@@ ers might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the per@@ missible limit was exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the punishment of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis said it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we speak of &quot; &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;

&quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual practice . &quot;
this is all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. ears and ears and ears , were widespread in the 197@@ 0@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then prohibited , he also kept strictly adher@@ ed to . &quot;
&quot; in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of test pun@@ ctu@@ ation also available to the language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI says from his perspective , because the Cathedral spar@@ rows played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he had a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but that must be said once : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without requiring un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form a institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone one does not make a big singer and before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep believing and heart@@ felt people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could do something just a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly receive , like many former dom@@ ink@@ atzen still , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ ding , visit him regularly , visit him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t forgive him until today , that he was once strict to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Cathedral @-@ cats are thank@@ ful to him that he en@@ riches her life and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good old teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely Res@@ pe@@ kt@@ own , to whom she is still looking forward to , and which she almost hon@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; and please , once more clearly : all you have accused of , are educational methods that were at the time of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sin@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the An@@ jun@@ abe@@ ats , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps Germany no one would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral @-@ cats , finally in peace . &quot;
