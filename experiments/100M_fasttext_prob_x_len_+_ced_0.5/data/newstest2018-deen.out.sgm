<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everyone who had to be exciting, because the car navigation took place in a green meadow instead of a perimeter road."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the State Government, are all other than current - but precisely so insightful."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur, since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flickering carpet that can't be recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called original compositions, have been added to cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"these were created according to the Bavarian surveying authority between 1810 and 1864, and the first surveying of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic picture of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bawaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the original version for Munich originates from 1856, and is like all the other on the Bavarian State Library website."</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of former / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>

<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling are located around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: a small map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered listings from the so-called" "priori" "derived from which the property tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots are now no more farmers - but a small gardener of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October fests, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the original position paper, in the area of today's district au-Haidhausen, there is not only the street name" "at Gasteig" "or" "Auf der Lüften" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at Auerfeldstraße, one once closed people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle of Irrenticist" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden initiated the establishment - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the Ankle of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, it was first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>

<seg id="40">"on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum."</seg>

<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential houses from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, one erected the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "- in architectural reference to the original building of the Irene Institution, which was destroyed during World War II in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" Main Place, "the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>

<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will take effect until August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, rapid-based occurrences occur in the entire state and be noted here," stated in the group's opinion.

<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and Death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under fragmentary circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and taken from the Missouri Police in custody without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General Public Prosecutor of Missouri, where it is shown that black motorists are being employed in the state 75 percent more frequently than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be prepared to bring bail money or let the relatives know they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it harder to sue a company due to housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after states adopted immigration laws allowing local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have adopted the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>

<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fira Square in Baghdad, in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals by the President to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitters would have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took its meaning, and in particular the significance it was attributed to, as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta said," I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is really right, but as he formulated it, it isn't really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the shaking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely, / the poor waste of your rich coasts. ""</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "ending waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed himself not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they had a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they have a very different name: mother of Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big screaming Rush Limbaugh, a kind of Johannes the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the statue of Liberty had no one invite anyone, but rather an early neoconservator who brought the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a question of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great phantasia act of Lazarus was to see them as they saw from the exhausted, poor, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the true sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred which is their only source of power."</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchers - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought together quite naturally were great.</seg>

<seg id="145">"Scotland's best overall score for athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>

<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen do not only belong to the team, but also in some cases also with medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special feature of being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team-mates have voted for me and chose me, it's something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It just shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb on stage."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as a captain is concerned?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to sit on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with less members in this month, as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase."</seg>

<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"to this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Fan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were piled over each other, without having to widen ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but placing the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement allowed the fan to place two rooms at full height, with a lot of additional drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous residential area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Moulin lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"on both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance we offer piped units, place for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a little engineering art went inside," "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counter-important so that when you move the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they managed to increase the floor area, and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional attachment in a home," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "you don't love you in the electric sockets in the walls."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they don't play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square metering of some standard in something very astonishing.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump, including the reports of the news media, hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporters Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff at his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House he wanted to repair: bad information falling into the president's hands."</seg>
<seg id="1395">"Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information."</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship to television last decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of jobs that were to convince him," said former electoral campaigner Sam Nunberg in February compared to Politico. "</seg>

<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>

<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with shameful leaks, and that it is stiffly to find out where they originate."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the President of malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of Staff Katie Walsh," the source behind a pile of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he voiced false accusations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began asking people about Walsh.</seg>

<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspirator from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>

<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornamented, two-story mausoleums of drug kingdoms that are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>

<seg id="1838">"in spite of the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke out that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"at first, the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the children, presumed gangster members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was that Valdez was unable to force Valdez, following the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>

<seg id="1847">"with time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and revenues and advertising took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters would love to be able to publish hard-looking investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else would dare to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever she conducted."</seg>

<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mix of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>

<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-sized district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in a joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who called the Governor himself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporter went into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce was born on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had a exposure to the state spending, concentrated on the Governor's hometown."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was abducted or how it was done, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite locally by drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled by the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the reader would have seen Valdez's column as the most informative source of the kidnapping."</seg>

<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>

<seg id="1892">"in a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy journalists and release them because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that she is re-partitioned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and a uniform society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces, who contested the organised crime under a blanket."</seg>

<seg id="1931">"he met something, which seemed out of the surrounding rocks, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that these herbivores, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage in order to hide from predators, and used a screen technology used as a counterfeit, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to interfere in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, say experts, indicating that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and now is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers now have studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armour over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the contershading, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although contacting is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs hunted from sufficient pressure by meat eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals who use the counter-shading - think of roe, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, what signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs carnivores must have been the Kreidezeit," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">HZI researchers discover control centres in Yersinia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and drove into the sea, where it sank on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as south florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with congenital skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintaining the original form of the animal," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just play a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Kreidezeit was a time when huge thermal periods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, went through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tonnes of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mummified in mud mummified."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely removed from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were weighed on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that moved from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the pandeed plant-eaters have been swarmed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the building blocks are still covered along the dinosaur along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in lotto."</seg>

<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her mobile phone to return later on the evening to tweet about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police tape and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be Browns's father who wore a shield with the inscription:" Fergusons police just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>

<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another police officer assured his rifle and cried," "I will kill you... animals all kill." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shaking frost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I was angry and wept." ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house, and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, who are living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrell, with her daughter, wore a flower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, both had a conversation that she had innumerable times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I couldn't take them with them," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>

<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped them to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document" "documenting" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell in the sense:" do you want to document or try to find a story you can use? "" "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but a community that cometh together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents from" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as she falls in love and her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell, and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film" "BlackLivesMatter" "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall," "said Ferrell," and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts. "</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main load of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is really held by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, she insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "where Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense their energy through the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home:" a chaos. ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clutches on a song and she feels obliged to remember that since she went to Ferguson three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>

<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, although they haven't been built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center on the south of the pedestrian zone divides the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold Specks Thees Uhlmann</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook page" Volksfreund Bitburg, "the theme is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't have a man "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents of building a gallery attract more customers into the city, including the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of construction work, it will be concluded."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Beda Square with an opportunity to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone Zimmer:" "we have been buying the farm market for many years now."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the rural women are always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We discovered a butcher shop for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like that even during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to sustain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is also this."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting." ""</seg>

<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping sprees in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">"you can see how many shops are empty here, some for months and years."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the product offered there is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is priced at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"* Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change; * Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"it is a pity, special stores are almost no longer there and that, which is still left, will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"Wolf Fandel:" "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit me together."</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery doesn't fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where is the farm market hall planned during construction time?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the spectre bit gallery before to expel all the shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">"George Marquet:" "that won't work."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping centre, which stands empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a correct peasant market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farm market hall, thanks to the unbelievably many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg have no place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"if the farmers market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost unmistakably identical - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts provided by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was a 35-year prison sentence after being classified as secret diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline is her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and a pioneering student whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg created the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman, was sentenced to 20 counts in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly seated on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "declared Dewey-Hagborg on a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she couldn't visit this time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her imprisoned Muse were unequal, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo's" Suppressed Images, "which foresaw a future in which the President Chelazzi would convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in fact, Obama actually had a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there are also now at the opening of the exhibition some deep and strong, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable paths that he should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things from a particular reason happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one of the artistic statements written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called on her superior signature among them (the" i "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to" automatic fragmentation, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg was hoping to show the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hope to take with us is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, also has to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in its own room, is a page from the comic-Novelle mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she emerges with a free-talk-efon in hand out of the discipline of the United States such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they keep your speech cool, then they have won," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greeted from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I always get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room from the masks, from their own genomic simulacles that merge into hordes of protectioners."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also target-oriented, as everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5" "2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haplogist groups were written with pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2581">"however, a new study confirms the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually advised to alleviate meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found out that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helped to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food cannot penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, a type of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice is found that carry a certain bacterium in its intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2588">Bacteria of theYersiniagenus elicit intestinal wallinflammationand serious diarrhoeal disease as well as other afflictions in humans. this genus includes theplague pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich diet tolerates rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also happens in humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell, which promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same stem, but it was not accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiologists of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in sterile environment so that they were lacking an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria were applied to the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerancing cells like mice, and that most of us have L. reuteri in our gastro-intestinal traps."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptopical values in the presence of L. reuteri lead to an extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2851">"more than 500 employees work in the plant, besides other products, Hobnobs and Rich tea cookies."</seg>
<seg id="2852">McVitie owner Pladi said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"he added that employees and trade union representatives would" "first experience" "if their activities would change."</seg>
<seg id="2854">"in a letter to the company manager of the company GMB Scotland McVitie said," "To express concern that financing for modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"GMB-Senior-Organisator Drew Duffy, said:" the fact that we can not gain clarity on business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross, concerns our members deeply. "</seg>
<seg id="2856">"generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage."</seg>
<seg id="2857">"therefore, under the prospect of jobs, wage and prosperity, and against the backdrop of the Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a thriving production presence at McVitie."</seg>

<seg id="2860">"we discussed with the employees that we operate like all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate, constantly checking our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - to remain competitive."</seg>
<seg id="2861">"she added:" in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross plant, especially in production lines and operational improvements. "</seg>

<seg id="2864">The side of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti regreen</seg>
<seg id="2865">"Paris Saint-Germain will not leave Neymar after having submitted an offer of £189 million to dissolve his release clause, but did they warned Barcelona three years before the world record?"</seg>
<seg id="2866">"the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record for more than the double of the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season."</seg>

<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned of the PSG presidency three years ago before this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">"when Manchester City was interested in signing Blaise Matuidi's signature, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of PSG's best players."</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," "said Al-Khelaifi."</seg>
<seg id="2872">"we respect all clubs.</seg>
<seg id="2873">"but if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."</seg>
<seg id="2874">"Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"PSG made clear that they would not permit it to the International from Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offerings for Neymar."</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases entailed Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">"this means that the resource in question identified itself as" "XHTML 1.0 Strict" "and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it."</seg>
<seg id="2891">The report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen further continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weir der, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared after the publication of the German press agency, he was expecting from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret about their omissions or their then false judgement of the events."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"on the other hand, the Vatican service" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticized that in reporting on violence in the Domsparrows with" two measures. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubted that" "shameful and shameful acts" "must be punished and prevented in the future; conspicuously is the" "degree of media manipulation", "the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and Member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of denying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "one likes to go to the church and that's a found frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" punches had been a very normal educational means, "to be done with friends, how I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for previous decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who dealt with Ratzinger, translated the memoirs of the" Mein brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440-page report, which was submitted by the diocese Regensburg with the education officer Ulrich Weber?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen have been abused between 1945 and early 1990s" with high plausibility "victim of overprints, 67 domain sparrows sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to numerous other accused, many victims underestimated the overall humanity of R., and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories with him are connected with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence exercise at the shelensburger Domspatzen, "gives a contradictory picture of the Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students raise their" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who became more tangible in the audience when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and read the whole 440 pages of long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the complicity or complicity in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"on the other hand, violence exams at the preschool took place outside of its sphere of influence."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to reproach him at best, to get out of it too late or to have taken the first hints seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the domum gymnasium, which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - as literal -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also portrays him as" warmhearted, "" "sincere," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding" as a very good teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cake, biscuits and bonbons and "always lagged by the grapes of children." "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to floods."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he himself had already admitted, deeply regretted, deeply regretted and apologized."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, it has to be said that educational methods were widely used in the early 1960s and 1970s, with parents such as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also have experienced this in a secular school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually about in this report, namely the horrifying sexual abuse and violence of violence at the preschool, this is true of Bagatellen."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"as a result, you wonder if it is not more likely to do with his reputation and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just jumped on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him are still busy."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in recent years, problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees" qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions. "</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger placed in the final report also any involvement or complicity in relation to sexual abuse?</seg>

<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said a spokesperson for the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in educating sexual abuse was, however, that most victims were silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even trust their parents and siblings, they certainly did not have a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">Matching Problems in the Labour Market: between Skills Shortage and Overeducation 05 August 2015</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student said: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely insights and could hold the relevant perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd, to assume that all of all of that... bubbles intrusive or clearer or more likely to have opened than opposite their parents, dormitory directors, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the report concludes with the clear result:" "that the pupil and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance, could not be confirmed during the examination."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore acquitted of every competitor."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"(users Viewing this Forum: 2) 3,864 619 Happy Birthday Newby!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to link its good name with these conflicting crimes, as it was unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, a lot of" "violence extermination" "was read in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking out" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do you have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence extortion and somewhere in the middle of the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">"but exactly this is, in turn, a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there, namely, cleanup: between the preschool and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence extermination, we say once and other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from time since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the Cathedral-atzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were stipulated and painted and suffered, were all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the domum gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"this was, like most of the witnesses, emphasised the theme" Preschool "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the domum gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims appreciated the overall humanity of R., and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories with him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"posted on January 30, 2014"</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he started to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently lock the ears in front of the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral secondary school, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in doing so, he points out that in the preschool, the punishment will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended an urgent step."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course at a time, as legal clarity, as an investigative punishments in Bavaria were long ago banned."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"in front of it, they were in a legal gray zone, like each of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult to estimate for him, where the sufferers might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said it was unfair to apply today's educational standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we speak of" "Fallstrick of Anachronism", "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual practice."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite awful and I am glad that it is finally being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punishment, i.e. ears and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970ies."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then prohibited, he also kept strictly adhered to."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"in the conversations with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of test punctuation also available to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI says from his perspective, because the Cathedral sparrows played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't know that he had a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but that must be said once: without this perfectionism, without requiring unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form a institution of world trang, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone one does not make a big singer and before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep believing and heartfelt people, from which one can't imagine that he could do something just a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly receive, like many former dominkatzen still, 23 years after his emeriding, visit him regularly, visit him, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who don't forgive him until today, that he was once strict to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Cathedral-cats are thankful to him that he enriches her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good old teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely Respektown, to whom she is still looking forward to, and which she almost honors."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once more clearly: all you have accused of, are educational methods that were at the time of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to become a medial sinner."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which has just been published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the Anjunabeats, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps Germany no one would know the Regensburger Cathedral-cats, finally in peace."</seg>
