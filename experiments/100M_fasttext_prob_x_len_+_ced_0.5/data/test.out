&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , asser@@ ted Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will be mas@@ sively reti@@ ring , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks , it has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes on the rich would be increased , she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;

&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement aims to cancel it . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly extend the renewable energy with its investment programme and urges : &quot; &quot; one country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;

&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says he cannot be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .

&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because they are persec@@ uted because they are persec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as a hope @-@ bear@@ er to Europe , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secre@@ tly because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , hon@@ ors , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;

many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experienced , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; since they are often unable to help , there are more accommodations for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district reg@@ im@@ ents are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like Munich in their jurisdiction , some are responding to no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ conia , there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , w@@ inged women are not accommod@@ ated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , government spokesman of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ conia , there are many common rooms or houses only for single @-@ standing women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot;
the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated by men .
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it is said , &quot; It is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;

matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Shortage and Overeducation
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new labour @-@ measures in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour @-@ measures starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had agreed to address the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assist@@ ants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; &quot; stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly &quot; &quot; to problems , which led to the agreement that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and demand official re@@ talks on all of your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board today has asked a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating campaign measures starting at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to assist@@ ants of this year thre@@ sh@@ olds , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar Dr. Johann Mal@@ awi came back after the election to reject the agreed conditions imposed by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during sessions , which still took place before the vote by 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for physicians in England would be introduced . &quot;
Europe &apos;s Role in an East Asian War - 9th August &apos; 15
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter @-@ player in the gold @-@ plated room of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot do the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be li@@ gn@@ y , and he hardly be@@ amed heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ ogan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper reported that Erd@@ ogan had been so lucky , as would never be something bad . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shot of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fu@@ elled .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall in the backs of Russia .
&quot; it was even bigger , since it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
&quot; the Vet@@ ro@@ pack re@@ building becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks were carrying all the blame . &quot;
&quot; at the most serious , the accus@@ ations from leading officials that Erd@@ ogan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria , which would be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin got the excuse from President Erd@@ ogan to hear the exc@@ uses he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ceas@@ ef@@ ire are clearly obvious . &quot;
Erd@@ ogan takes first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been tor@@ tured by a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat in the last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number is almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agents and charter airlines will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are res@@ umed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season attack on the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ č@@ sti , as follows : &quot; tourists are long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the west because its reaction to the attempts to power over power is regarded as weak response .
&quot; for this purpose , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU membership negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ v@@ ot to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara with security , that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected state institutions . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , that even a deep @-@ seated fear of reg@@ im@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this splendid palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and have been badly treated and are now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both presi@@ dents at the press conference said that they would not even have stri@@ pped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey inten@@ tionally avoided a question of its differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when the NATO member of Turkey shot the Russian fighter jets - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least agree with each other . &quot;

&quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus within ( we have asked ) to make this a better bench for customers ? &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;

&quot; Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jockey of Modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone , just a few before him . &quot;
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intell@@ ect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for race , enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thri@@ lled fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already brought 6,000 gains if he was not only a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;

Russian Putin fire Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed his chief of staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s closest friend of confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , Putin has ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Deputy Vice President since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplomat . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in Tall@@ inn &apos;s Est@@ onian capital , he graduated from the renowned state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is ( in Russian ) that he later was a protocol leader and vice president of the government . &quot;
&quot; on his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of head , regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysti@@ cism .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest acqua@@ int@@ ances and works like he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , both men claimed that Chief of Staff left his own wish . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
no one knows this at the moment .
but the official statement - that a man who once had been praised as a potential president to once again lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I &apos;ve asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
&quot; he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the state security service K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; as Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin would have viol@@ ated the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post has been taken by Putin &apos;s nearest allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became president of three and a half years later .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approaches the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weigh@@ s 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 lan@@ tern cables . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a hot activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete pit for the deck , which means that the deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the closure is a forward @-@ looking high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after installation of the last street pit section and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the landing page . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very hot work .
&quot; massive as the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 meters long , weigh@@ s about 6@@ .000 tons and had to be pulled up at an inc@@ line of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; Hei@@ kel , as the toler@@ ances in which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they only ru@@ ined a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;

&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat moved on their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the ladder of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its reach until we left to water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at age 60 and was found hanging on a bo@@ je without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat motor had an emergency stop@@ per , but this triggered the boat from the person who st@@ alled the boat . &quot;
someone has cried about these men today .

&quot; in the first place , it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .

&quot; however , the low @-@ priced apartments may also occur in the stock . &quot;

&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such sites , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions of euros and has to be financed , is to provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;

&quot; nevertheless , no matter how Brat@@ mann writes , a ti@@ ghtening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the action plan is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; but still , the program is not entirely : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of further about 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion is going to run over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 , it will be 500 homes alone . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be bought out @-@ out ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring back apartments back to the price . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; on one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; in the west city , dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; only : the owners , the housing companies do not want to . &quot;
&quot; since the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased , one is from the goal of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; mixing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a concentration of social @-@ poor in just a few parts of the city will no longer exist .

&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in the publication of the game in the United States , Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are followed by a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , closed the run@@ way and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps leading to the &quot; average person &quot; every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of tra@@ cked people , who exercise every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health , people want to bring about 30 minutes of time , &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; being active every day &quot; &quot; came on de@@ af ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look el@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; however , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
who is doing sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to address them here . &quot;
&quot; but the won@@ dro@@ us thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are also min@@ us@@ ky gam@@ bl@@ ers who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has made itself a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit have already been able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ emon &apos;s success , there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the active will be combined in the real world and help many people to be active , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es is on all the im@@ mu@@ n .

effort@@ less on the beam .

&quot; on the whole line , brilliant . &quot;
&quot; and now , finally , Olympic champion . &quot;
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the championship title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly rais@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ allion Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ f on the Swedish flag during the Women &apos;s Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a championship title and total the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey took an end .
&quot; this success is in the same league as the unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es domin@@ ates the last three years , 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so astonishing exercises that involve a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot;

&quot; although Bil@@ es insisted , during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
&quot; a part of their floor exercises - which includes their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic stadium in Rio . &quot;
this is not a coinci@@ dence .

&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina was made easy by two turns , the picture dec@@ eived . &quot;
Swedish k@@ nights and bow@@ ls - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she repeated with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish bar again - and sat down on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; she gently emb@@ raced her end @-@ story - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flo@@ ated in Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ man was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina went . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot;

murder OF JO@@ UR@@ N@@ AL@@ IS@@ TS AND TRU@@ TH@@ SE@@ EK@@ ERS
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Ro@@ ch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a drive , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm , while he was standing on the side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the triple murder was not the result of a rob@@ bery , as the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ woman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that shooting has led investig@@ ators to get a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed and two further injured in the His@@ panic residential area within four months in nine attacks . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , announced the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown ma@@ iden from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to disc@@ lose the evidence they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same killer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;

&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I did not do that . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage this .
I don &apos;t have to leave that .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , it has been left to it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her was told that they may never be able to recognize them , and that he may not even survive . &quot;

it can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .

&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- it says . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .

I always asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know it yet .

&quot; the last big floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ess said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be floo@@ ded , but on Friday there were no reports . &quot;

the police told that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several injuries , including in the end , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at the hospital when he was transferred to hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transm@@ itter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the channel with that he is expected to recover again .
he would have to start the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .

&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ am@@ ship in the tower and that is for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer olymp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three turbin@@ es , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly rais@@ man , the Jü@@ lich and Madison Ko@@ cian , which is Catholic , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the head of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American . &quot;
last year we were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and the Americas . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she expected unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ nec@@ tics rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold at an individual combined competition event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly rais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this kind of sport , but no classes in the whole country do not look like . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the last five , because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ as@@ tics in the team . moreover , it is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that gymn@@ as@@ tics will be a costly sport and gymn@@ as@@ tics will be held primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these gymn@@ asi@@ ums lie in wealthy subur@@ bs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired by the municipalities of au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , making a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access training . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years ago .
&quot; in my events , we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) , and national and international winners are trained . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality turbin@@ es that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to take part in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the wood of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , so many young girls motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant veter@@ in@@ arians would like to organise more strikes after having rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants voted in a vote , rejected it . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt plans were revealed to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants are supposed to receive a new contract , which contains amend@@ ments to night and weekend work to improve maintenance . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chairman of the BM@@ A committee for assist@@ ants distributed last night in a message with : &quot; &quot; assist@@ ants have agreed to the proposed Treaty like before serious concerns , in particular that it is the current occupancy crisis and it will be given to treat all physicians . &quot;
&quot; at only eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes caused by discussions in the government for resistance and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made it last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jeremy Hunt must act now to raise the vibration and address the concerns of assist@@ ants .
&quot; if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to carry out further work measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dead@@ lines , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in providing physicians on the strike post chain coverage . &quot;

&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS staff , called on the assist@@ ants to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; labour @-@ measures achieve nothing but only little , but burden the teams and service providers and prepare patients , peac@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers and their families only concerns , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the past two months , we talked to the committee of the assist@@ ants and responded positively to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ ans and the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as des@@ patch , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training and the gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health have been responsible for compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication which can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after recommended by the authorities to meet these more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; this medicine is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year long @-@ term intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year long @-@ term intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty materials in the ar@@ tery walls , forming the bases . &quot;
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ log the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the flow of blood and c@@ logging the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and mark@@ eted under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making blood cl@@ ots more unlikely . &quot;
&quot; the pipeline design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a preliminary review of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend the available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all , the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . &quot;
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves election fraud in Muslim territories
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report for corruption out of office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is unknow@@ ingly ignored like a devastating government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les attacks the police , election observers and Rath@@ thers to have ignored the evidence of election abuse due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al Government , who is now an antagon@@ ist , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier belts outside of electoral cabins to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should have a passport with themselves to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must only name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person , if they give their votes to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; that serves not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture , which is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets electoral sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ate court ruled that the acting Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; &quot; and that he would have brought his critics into silence with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a im@@ itation , in which a person cho@@ oses someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed concerns about the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - if the older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean@@ se the electoral system , including conducting statements to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as evidence it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was ex@@ er@@ ted , especially women and young people in order to vote according to the Will@@ ens of the El@@ derly , in particular communities with Pakistani or b@@ ang@@ lad@@ ean background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... State institutions such as &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; beliefs concerning the eth@@ no and religion were know@@ ingly ignored . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric addressed 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists will process letters to stop &quot; &quot; election harvest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May , requires harder registration checks to prevent that the electoral list is used for immigration and social assistance purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
&quot; un@@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger , as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic review of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ate .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic mail selection .
ban that political activists work complete letters and envel@@ opes of letters .
the police force the authority to set up deport@@ ations for election stations .
&quot; according to the re@@ pres@@ sions of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Represent@@ atives Act 1983 ) , a change of legislation was facilit@@ ated by the prosecution of the People Act 1983 . &quot;
photography prohibited in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets fall , no criminal complaint has been made . &quot;
&quot; the election court ruled Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty due to a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ efficient &quot; &quot; shut@@ down controls &quot; &quot; of the vot@@ er registration departments of the Town Hall . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; The court in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ rt at the time on our screens , F@@ e has created a list of Olymp@@ ism that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ rities . &quot;

&quot; apart from K@@ atie &apos;s dup@@ lication on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi &apos;s Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;

&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ers got ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has been listening to his childhood since his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see a big simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy shared the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I thought it was a compli@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 , this year will undoubtedly be the centre of attention : the rising simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ jum@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris . &quot;
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes will be able to go through as a double @-@ player for the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison . &quot;
a course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the Inc@@ eption Drama .
&quot; a further sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ b@@ illed skin and blond hair like actress An@@ na@@ Lyn@@ ne McC@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face @-@ shape and eyes &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; theory into the room : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;

&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot;

the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against arms attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it more secure for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ one M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers near distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dator . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; says M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow .

&quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , technology is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and rotate it , so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , keep the weight on the weapon and beat the aggres@@ sor on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;

Rei@@ gn Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British traveler under@@ went his immune system and lit@@ tering of a serious test - by appo@@ inting some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places of Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k took off his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a sink of a pull toil@@ ette and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before checking every object , he used an L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and show us what it is going on . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the thought of det@@ ecting the pur@@ ging button of a toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr Wright reported with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he was distra@@ cted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright was known to test the resili@@ ence of his dar@@ ms by travelling through the world , and ate wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public money to train stations to flus@@ hing toilets , the task posed his immune system definitely under one sample . &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all kinds of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
the only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test sme@@ ar showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ omet@@ ers of freshly washed hands are less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused , after its lumin@@ omet@@ ers were more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this comes the worst thing I &apos;ve got in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers a really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; Let us Ian call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is a global phenomenon .
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film director , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ar@@ ous@@ ed some of the things I had ordered him , as the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to , they pun@@ ish them and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .

&quot; a social @-@ social family left their social housing after a delay with a loss of £ 50,000 , because they terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Sk@@ el@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ model@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls were exposed exposed holes , wooden floors were torn up , ru@@ bb@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was sme@@ ared on the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation .
&quot; Donna Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repair . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider when this property is pres@@ um@@ ably considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is too .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had inf@@ lic@@ ted the family , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and floo@@ ds . &quot;

&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under circumstances , old g@@ arbage was found . &quot;
&quot; they were in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , ri@@ pped on wooden floors . &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ ous@@ ed her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the estate after they gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volun@@ tar@@ ily withdraw .
the del@@ ta was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t get rid of anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the inn@@ um@@ erable times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to this !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;

&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the municipal building , ru@@ bb@@ ish and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ants agree to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ ta is always the last step that Corn@@ wall Housing has taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely extreme and their actions had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall Police as well as members of the community who have been cour@@ age@@ ous and have provided the information to us . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will be donated to some neighbours , and the message expresses that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

Sk@@ el@@ don received a fine fine after having found himself guilty of the possession of a class B drug .
she claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Sk@@ el@@ don was born in 2013 in a car accident .
&quot; after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room walls of the house were gra@@ zed with gra@@ ffiti .
&quot; the police say they will del@@ ude ten@@ ants , who do not cling to the house rules &quot;
&quot; Angela C@@ row from the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall Police reported that the del@@ ta was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , who don &apos;t stick to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can act without self @-@ repro@@ aches , as well as those who were damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

the two Chinese have succeeded in the final game as expected and made the title one another .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , Chinese could fetch the single title in the sign of the five rings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches . &quot;

the I@@ OC wants to set up a disciplinary mission to the case .
&quot; after the second Dop@@ ing affair , Kenya &apos;s athletes thre@@ aten the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; after a suicide attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee immediately set up a disciplinary mission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan team reported that the former spr@@ inter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the team leadership of Kenya has been reported by the dop@@ ing controllers . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Federation has sought the I@@ OC for information on the case in order to raise their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesperson said . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the I@@ OC , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said the IA@@ AF declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and was issued as F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ credi@@ tation of the athletes who stood on the list of the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich has become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .

&quot; according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , the I@@ OC has been under special surveillance for a long time in the I@@ OC . &quot;
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2,000 dop@@ ing target controls laid before the Rio Games , it was reported that athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken to a visa . &quot;
&quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency practi@@ sed a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , the W@@ AD@@ A Kenya adopted from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of the W@@ AD@@ A . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya Dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud . &quot;

&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the classical temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
&quot; in the orchest@@ ral pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ steins &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this stage , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she is reminis@@ cent of W@@ eh@@ mut about her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very much , my Italian character I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so an honor to work with her .
she is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli returns to the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheer@@ ful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; in this piece , it is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;

&quot; according to the dec@@ eit@@ ful put@@ sch , still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to re@@ start in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees is produced refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the association chief compla@@ ined of the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in the Algeri@@ an cities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Erd@@ ogan wants to increase the departure pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exp@@ elled or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ministry of Health , the Federal Government is &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ ogan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in the last few months , I did not feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks to foreign countries .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;

&quot; as the newspaper reported on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of State , the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised for political persecution in Germany because of political persecution . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all workers as conscientious obj@@ ectors ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;

Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it does &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westph@@ alia are not allowed to choose the country tag .
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they have understood . &quot;
&quot; in 2021 , the country &apos;s election will not be held right at the end of the summer holidays , the heavy Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is concerned , summer holidays , heat and day @-@ to @-@ day sw@@ ings - that bit@@ es itself . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the candidates , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most holi@@ day@@ makers , who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so are not allowed to choose the country tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ating ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and counting at the end of voices are only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the Feri@@ a , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign to the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU . &quot;
&quot; it is exciting , how strongly Ne@@ uling Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of coalition dust . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old , and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from its large @-@ scale posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ aps a little with the people , just as it is his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has received cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CDU , with its chief candidate , the Minister of the Interior of Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if at the wrong time it is at the right place election campaign . &quot;
&quot; she has invited two ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to major investigations ; Merkel , the Bundestag , is located in the north @-@ east . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame to anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;

the Union has noticed that on the country the base is crum@@ bling down the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people .
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CDU electoral campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert , however , is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; you must go to where the people are : cod , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;

&quot; since the construction site was w@@ asted on Monday to the south , and the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again , the traffic situation is relaxed within the location . &quot;

&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is launching a second run for proposals that have not been made with the SPD to date : he wants to raise support for terrorist groups , and sni@@ ff@@ ing ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;

&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted specifically to the country should check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a safety check . &quot;
&quot; in case of Dul@@ les for expi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants some even worse than to date - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately disc@@ lose their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legally hei@@ gh@@ ted .
some people also work un@@ ev@@ enly and leaves questions open .
&quot; and with some points - at the im@@ balance of commem@@ or@@ ations , for example , the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the themes of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about the safety of the refugees in the face of the high refugee rates . &quot;
&quot; and things that pro@@ found@@ ly employed people , did not let themselves be enth@@ ron@@ ed in election campaigns . &quot;
internal security is enorm@@ ously shaped .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the Att@@ acks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election campaigns . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of internal security , the Union and SPD are becoming increasingly important in the issue of internal security . &quot;

the Ministry of Transport has confirmed that this meeting was held .
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW fulfilled the requirements of my In@@ quiry Commission and the KBA executive board . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ministry of Transport , Federal Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CSU ) declared : &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after retro@@ fitting , and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not how it was named in corporate circles . &quot;
&quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come to a workshop for half a year after upgra@@ ding to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interest of customer interest , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the abor@@ tion scandal , resulting in uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit , and I &apos;ll get wild , before I stop , hold my hands and say something better : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly on its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
&quot; Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( data quantity : eight men middle aged , a woman , pres@@ um@@ ably around the 20 ) , is a day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these record boards , depicted above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and pl@@ ough@@ ed .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like spending time alone , adding : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who heard about the com@@ eback and set out to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have guided , people usually have to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .

&quot; some of the record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound panel covers , from objects that w@@ aking happy youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this is with me as a collector so and I think it is so , with many people . &quot;
it is a simple way to deal spirit@@ ually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; creates a staff of a pile @-@ pile . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , have not yet heard them . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player , which they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while I browse through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( data quantity : three men middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; trophy of trophy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came just recently and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radio @-@ gil@@ ead sound board so that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product weight , less music @-@ class . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who are only slowly entering . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , who has dedicated the record floor almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go pu@@ zz@@ led . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle ages . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts newly @-@ known synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ ist pop instead of experimental jazz spo@@ ils from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; no one of them looks very lonely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to determine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds . &quot;

she is more likely to take a bust than a big buy .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so the collecting of plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a loving si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the appearance of pat@@ tern@@ ed jeans , I watched a group of young teen@@ age girls who are looking for a moment to group pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a stair@@ case , a wall full of boards of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential sheets for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
&quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; record artwork &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items may mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most for luxury items like plates . &quot;

&quot; a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which people sell goods , cigarettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ sers or simple meals for a few euros in provis@@ ional restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid .
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they concluded that provis@@ ional stores and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run the 72 ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places under threat was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is non @-@ char@@ itable and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was meant that the closing &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camps has increased to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers in the course of the summer . &quot;

&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabili@@ t@@ ating bridges with temporary tem@@ ples , there is often no necessary infrastructure in order to provide a stationary eye for compliance with speed limit . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , the case data are encryp@@ ted via a mo@@ dem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits , as well as transit ban on time , travel strip and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly @-@ driven state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply cl@@ oned , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear in a sweat @-@ proof outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the Bli@@ tzer from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer will be tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used . &quot;

&quot; Fi@@ ji announced a master class in handling , side @-@ ping , back @-@ back , line running and ro@@ wers force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was lost due to the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on this day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the decisive defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a comfort for UK - but it is unlikely that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;

&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was crossing the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner which he converted . &quot;

&quot; a hil@@ arious T@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;

&quot; it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the GB still se@@ eded . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anian gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed through a brilliant Inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the Southern Division , whose fans sang and d@@ anced and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s playful approach .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ e put the i icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and the GB ki@@ cked no@@ d@@ ded in the grass . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ final with 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the boats in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton rolled off the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer to win rowing victory
there will be no more emot@@ ive gold than in these games and that wants what is called .
&quot; from the first strokes to the last , 220 hard hi@@ ve that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ aci@@ o da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat on the ru@@ dder , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present as her second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the two @-@ seater without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , who laid on such a standard . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , at least their 39.@@ 4 un@@ covered use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of tri@@ um . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on is on willing hel@@ pers who make up the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference , and nobody knew whether he would survive the day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had fortunately that he could begin treatment early in 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right term under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so it had to be better to go back soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing of itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ven@@ erable morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . this is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I would have no better person for a trainer or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
&quot; even in the last 500 metres , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to finish , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; Helen shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking forward to doing something T@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want a fireworks , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ will . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want that my last race was .
that would have been too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;

a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ water association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; some time ago , it was the name of the Bayer@@ ischer Rundfunk ( Bayer@@ ischer Rundfunk ) . &quot;

now he retired in retirement at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ water association of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , supports approximately 15@@ 0000 cu@@ bic meters of water every year and provides 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member churches are the municipalities of Kirch@@ heim , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; for more towns and municipalities , there are water supply contracts . &quot;
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ mark in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended themselves from the water management and maintenance work on office and organisational skills , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to the weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , she named the commission@@ ing and initi@@ ation of the new well ( 1994 ) , land acquisitions in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the refur@@ bishment of the high @-@ tank ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ visions of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no bre@@ ast@@ feeding , and I have always picked up new innovations , because water is de@@ bit@@ tered and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ bel &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it would be his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was a real practition@@ er to present the success of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe to the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ conia . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , he received a lot of recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water@@ man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a cli@@ max out of his view , he described the well @-@ building and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the pi@@ ping at the high container in Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3rd . &quot;
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees , the whole night had to work throughout the night so that the towns could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ orf with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; therefore , the European Commission initially planned to use steel producers to use gases from the blast furn@@ ace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;

&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the gener@@ ators are replaced in the steel works , an E@@ EG change is 20 percent . &quot;
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the IG Metall welcomed the agreement on Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ ownership . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the current regulation is largely fixed . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;

the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from excess capacity since the 2008 financial crisis and a considerable price pressure .
&quot; last year , the situation further exac@@ erb@@ ated the situation as the world &apos;s largest producer country , in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand of massive steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers throw price d@@ umping from Chinese steel companies .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation is somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import tari@@ ffs on import steel have been shown , and the economic outlook in China has shr@@ unk in China . &quot;

&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; the singing of Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ mt University she ranked the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an elderly choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and overall living , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , they do something good for their health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular co@@ hes@@ ion , sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; social and family structures often solve themselves , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; speak and organize themselves to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; in the positive sense , singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep your lungs regularly , don &apos;t get so quickly out of the pu@@ rest in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even if it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice at the age of age , S@@ ingen is an ideal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , but I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; at the same time , concent@@ rating on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; even older people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I have a long time for something , I will improve and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks of having little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who h@@ ears when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in the search for the suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone from the acqua@@ int@@ ance circle sings in a senior choir , you can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
&quot; if you want to sing in a church choir , you can contact the church or church leader directly . &quot;
many senior choir cho@@ irs are also found on the internet .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; he who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for every age .

&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; said armies Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to comment on possible motives , however , it is likely to act in the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media refused to recognise a pattern that is typical for the bomb@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ rection or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it is clear that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities had kept secret evidence of im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact time and the places . &quot;

&quot; the police pointed out their officials throughout the country to rein@@ force security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are still smaller bomb attacks , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;

the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution laid out by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence even in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to sti@@ fle chaos , while the country progres@@ sed towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had taken power in 2014 after a period of bloody turbul@@ ence , has agreed to have the kingdom reg@@ ained its stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting the grip of the rebel@@ lion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people were killed . &quot;
&quot; just a year ago , in Bangkok , an attack on a popular Hind@@ u @-@ Sh@@ ine was killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;

&quot; we see at the &apos; Identi@@ t@@ arian Movement &apos; for efforts against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; &quot; said Mr Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ at of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
that is why we are now watching the movement .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ t@@ arian Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of its own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;

&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ t@@ arian Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where they stand , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Director . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts attempt to address them with a young language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
&quot; the Islam@@ ists , as well as the right extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
this is not a concrete advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , there were reports about contacts of the &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; when Ma@@ ite said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts in this type are relevant only from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so if such people have an influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with regard to the clear increase of right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ine said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have seen in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing extremis@@ m structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Free Group .
&quot; it can be quite obvious that other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recogni@@ zable . &quot;
&quot; the present groups were created at the regional level , or in social networks . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Ma@@ ine expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the suspects for asylum seek@@ ers are not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; however , many people have committed criminal off@@ ences which were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have voted for example CDU , SPD or left , which were then radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood . &quot;

&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;

six rescue cars and a ambul@@ ance car came to the accident site at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ break@@ able travellers were brought back to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .

the investig@@ ators demanded the truck drivers and witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cu@@ bic meter of waste are from 1 October 2016 to the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ ge ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ewater costs will be increased at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a ra@@ iny calculation , the wast@@ ewater costs in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic metre . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CSU ) reported , under the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rats@@ amt Kul@@ mb@@ ach , there was evidence that under@@ cover for these wast@@ ewater treatment plants . &quot;
&quot; due to legal requirements , Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ effective manner . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sch ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg have to interv@@ ene deeper into the pur@@ se bag . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
&quot; as Director Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the wast@@ ewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; Schmidt thus founded the grave fees raised by relatively small facilities with a very low waste water waste , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; in addition , wast@@ ewater in all three plants is slightly decreased . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation period in all three systems , all three systems finally fell to a considerable extent due to their age of refur@@ bishment and repair costs . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ th@@ eri@@ als , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt demonstrated that the mechanical ventilation system had to replace the mechanical ventilation system due to damage .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge has to be installed , the sewage slu@@ dge has to be installed , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ es and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to keep the water law guidelines in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs came to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;

&quot; they asked themselves whether these repeated controversi@@ es indicate a greater problem , that the company has a diversity of diversity . &quot;

the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .

&quot; in an email he wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose clients were widely spread across the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and to be said un@@ pleas@@ antly . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she added that &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very resistant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot;

&quot; the Central Command , short cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;

&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the guide errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed contin@@ ual problems in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi Armed Forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts face pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of Congress were clearly more positive than it was the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that a military recon@@ quest of Mos@@ sul@@ s may already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Con@@ gres@@ sman from Kansas , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them , that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information , while the investigation will continue . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports by the Chief Editor of the Ministry of Defence in the G@@ ange . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Service Commission published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; said the High@@ land Democ@@ rat in the Com@@ mit@@ ee , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; said mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave a moder@@ ately little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the demo@@ crats gave no evidence of an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts in terms of a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general insp@@ ector , which were recorded after complaints from Cent@@ com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Mr. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokesman for the Pentagon , admitted that the Ministry of Defense would not comment any reports of the Congress , while investig@@ ative investigations were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also said that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have further effects on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; the accus@@ ations of the past year , however , rejected the question how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism in regard to the secret information about the Islamic State is more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , dra@@ fted a document on how the then government under George W. Bush had fores@@ een a small occupation force in Iraq and devast@@ ated a little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker after stating government points that the refin@@ eries held against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial position , since these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this knowledge , however , was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ ous commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US won the fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; a day after she had shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two goals for the American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember it ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their group . &quot;
&quot; the first place will take a little longer to the strong Dutch , which will lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game goes out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising twist through their success story , four years after they landed in the past London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time a hockey player in his hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she was the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; they missed the Olympics in 2008 , as they did not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot;
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which she and her team went all the way . &quot;
&quot; in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things into a better way . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work ens@@ um in London that we now have .
we have to rip the ru@@ dder completely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door in the first half of the game with a reco@@ il from the close range . &quot;
&quot; India was without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flank , then pulled into the middle and le@@ ap@@ ed the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the ra@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and in@@ escap@@ able , a swi@@ ft relay race between competition and aspi@@ ration . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is served by the w@@ rist@@ watch to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlon . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queu@@ e in the coff@@ e@@ eshop , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a black flock of dimples , could have been under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ ast or even f@@ encing . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting for gold in the Olympic Games . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade , the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast and may it take a long time .
&quot; but if I should make modest arguments for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the disc@@ ern@@ ing charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ se that many people , I had asked , did not know that it was an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the United States sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ oline jumping and had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who succeeded in the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans to share for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline jumping has a certain out@@ si@@ der char@@ me , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear , for a c@@ lown school that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , which combines two sports , which essentially un@@ ites it . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; rising winners jump on a giant tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling mot@@ ions ( turning , real and sal@@ at ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; they are rated according to the official Olympic programme , according to specification , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ and @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common olymp@@ ic vector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts in their pursuit of gold continue to go faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes down and back , upwards and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also another major objective in television transmission : the world or the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the targeted stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , admi@@ rable , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even add a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel at watching these games as a little ti@@ ring .
the tramp@@ oline offers an At@@ emp@@ ause .
the vector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ al@@ ds , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessly like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ ward , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the Quali@@ fication and En@@ dr@@ ons of Women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the ends as part of an afternoon session on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia @-@ man@@ ia they promise a peaceful , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as it recently proposed the male U.S. Turner , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan@@ base . &quot;

violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators demanding political changes in Ethiopia faced violent resistance by the government .
witnesses testi@@ fy that sixty protesters were killed during clas@@ hes with police .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of Western Europe with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 3 ( Southern Europe ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 4 ( North European )
&quot; according to witnesses , polic@@ emen were shot and killed at sixty un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; in the circul@@ ating video about the protests which are pres@@ um@@ ably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;

&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will even become more difficult , &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;

&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , in particular in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dras@@ tically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; eu@@ c @-@ kr ( Korean ) gb@@ 23@@ 12 ( Chinese , simplified ) gb@@ 180@@ 30 ( Chinese , simplified ) &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in jail , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you want to supp@@ ress people and have no other options to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lect@@ urer in central Ethiop@@ ien . &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation is protest@@ ing .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gling over power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions rise along the border to Eritrea . a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts feared that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which were forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence over the last few years , could be armed and re @-@ armed . &quot;
&quot; several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of hatred , under the surface , now explo@@ de . &quot;
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
Vali@@ date@@ err@@ or@@ pages Verb@@ ose@@ Output Clean up Markup with HTML @-@ Ti@@ dy Help on the options is available . congratulations
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia mainly to Christian high@@ lands , flour@@ ished in politics and economy as they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are under a umbrella , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , representing around 6 percent of the population and domin@@ ating the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death to a non @-@ public@@ ised illness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that it was especially deliber@@ ated to perceive early signs of dis@@ content and use special officers to handle opponents , and to make them harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; eu@@ c @-@ jp ( Japanese , Unix ) shift _ j@@ is ( Japanese , Win / Mac ) iso @-@ 2022 @-@ jp ( Japanese , email ) &quot;
&quot; unlike the Lord Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; eu@@ c @-@ jp ( Japanese , Unix ) shift _ j@@ is ( Japanese , Win / Mac ) iso @-@ 2022 @-@ jp ( Japanese , email ) &quot;
&quot; during the raid , many protesters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months , and this time of distur@@ ban@@ ces went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts lob@@ b@@ ying Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
Vali@@ date@@ err@@ or@@ pages Verb@@ ose@@ Output Clean up Markup with HTML @-@ Ti@@ dy Help on the options is available . congratulations
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ ested in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , conducted by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes increasingly common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests in the US and other Western allies will lead to a peculiar position .
&quot; the U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently announced they had closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally collap@@ sing in an already vol@@ atile region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin em@@ igration . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disper@@ se the last controversy on Friday , killing his campaign by attacking his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republican candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sible with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his associates , who endeav@@ or to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain the peculiar position that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after taking the clari@@ fication of an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump ru@@ ined his statement on Thursday and insisted on the fact that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tr@@ ump , wanted to we@@ aken the statement by remember@@ ing that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican candidate won &apos;t want to know about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism is pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down to Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tries to draw the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches at the economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic again . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech bored . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he attracted strong criticism when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but he later said &quot; &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics , and then return to demand . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages will be taken by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ agu@@ ely enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even more cau@@ tious tone since its survey results have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head racing in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his provoc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics of dist@@ orting his statements or mis@@ understanding his sense of humor . &quot;
&quot; but while in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the in@@ convenient situation to stand for him regardless of how provoc@@ atively his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; this is the first time I &apos;ve heard of this , and I think it &apos;s a good thing to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statement , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama is an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ ben@@ ders , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he pulled out the troops out of Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being taken up against each of his words and taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , j@@ aw@@ ful &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You cannot . &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats ridicul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology as only another proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once over the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ amy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash not to have Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front was pushed . &quot;
&quot; the store So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , sold in summer 2014 , sold soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
locals wor@@ shi@@ ped it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is changing , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ B@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel is exc@@ epted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is changing , then it &apos;s new . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new version has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the publisher is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new out@@ si@@ der , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept much . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so ash@@ ine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu , sand@@ wiches are served with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nishing such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ te onions . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 2 ) 2,@@ 7@@ 64 295 &quot;
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a constant stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ vei@@ ra was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ vei@@ ra , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the verb . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee drunk , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , instead of her usual Iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal is a further long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
&quot; he went there in front of the work , and inevitably became the same . &quot;
&quot; I came quarters to seven , every day , like a swis@@ s pocket watch and they prepare my Everything @-@ B@@ agel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and capture new ingredients into the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes everything @-@ ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment of it , that the soap business had taken the old business area . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with cold @-@ bo@@ iled coffee of coffee as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents of Green@@ points also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the Polish menu into Polish , and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had done it soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local sa@@ ff@@ ron wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favour@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café was closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the order offered a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the Oval Office . &quot;
&quot; as a Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acies of Fi@@ fth Avenue as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; its menu on this day was somewhat modest : stuff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people suffering , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told her story &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest co @-@ operation , &quot; An an@@ ual meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snow@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; when the reporter asked Hack@@ ney , this was appropriate for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , g@@ inger@@ bread and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheap prepared to reach the ingredient .
imagine to eat so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as d@@ inners .
Co@@ E gr@@ inned .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; man@@ sions of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked past@@ es for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Meal &quot; &quot; stands out the ways in which the country went with it , no longer the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se issue , Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget : mysterious food such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ole were too stap@@ le , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; &quot; wonderful way of re@@ sist@@ ing food resi@@ du@@ es , &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man noted , because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper des@@ ic@@ cant .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
strange mix@@ tures were tried because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen .
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes , bricks prepared a dish from this epo@@ ch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement at noon , &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions don &apos;t fit together .
it was typical for many of the house economic recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country like this . &quot;
&quot; by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary polic@@ emen &quot; and the challenge to transform the lamp like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Meal &quot; is a feast of historic treats .

&quot; as described in the book , a house@@ keeper has no interest in fla@@ vors through Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , dealing with eating , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;

&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life into play , to draw people out of broken homes and to aid the first aid in the war . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian polic@@ eman , which shows him on a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a m@@ amm@@ ing from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol of symboli@@ sm in the horror of war .

&quot; in fact , the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist probably assumed that Gre@@ enland &apos;s ha@@ y was st@@ acked . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Gre@@ enland &apos;s ha@@ y is hard to observe , finally they live above all in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Gre@@ enland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter . &quot;
researchers are aware of the li@@ festy@@ les of the Gre@@ enland @-@ ha@@ y .
her time ser@@ pent@@ ine measures her when she equi@@ ps six animals with a transm@@ itter in front of the Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
&quot; nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ ro@@ ls on the bottom of the Ice Cream and seek cad@@ aver , which tor@@ hin@@ dered from higher water layers . &quot;
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Gre@@ enland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as by@@ catch coming from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest Ha@@ i was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long , while the biggest 502 cm is measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a striking amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons search for larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the length of 220 cen@@ timet@@ ers length , the lens core , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons ; it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Gre@@ enland @-@ ha@@ y , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens core , resulting in cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ off @-@ 14 @-@ o &apos;clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timet@@ res long Grön@@ land@@ shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record Ha@@ i with 502 cen@@ timet@@ res could even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; Gre@@ enland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers could as@@ sign the length of an age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sex@@ ually mature age and its age was determined 156 years ago , Gre@@ enland hair with multip@@ lication is evident at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ ali@@ es live mainly in icy waters is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 years old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon @-@ tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there is often running on as@@ par@@ agus . &quot;
&quot; so , they mature later - and slower slower . &quot;
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal feeds warmth .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than at a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as much as possible as possible as possible as possible , &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should invest more in a long life . &quot;

&quot; with relief , the committee adopted the message of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; the sale of land in the residential building areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - Section 1 ) for interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the b@@ uns in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au attract young families and former sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it was said , building consent can be noti@@ fied immediately at the City Hall , and the share of the plots is expected to be consult@@ ed in its September session . &quot;

&quot; Hillary Clinton has published its tax declaration on Friday on Friday , which resulted in the demo@@ crats of the demo@@ crats and their husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charity purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated revenues of USD 3 million from the Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for their book about their term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;

&quot; Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election has been removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media u@@ pro@@ ar after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin had not listed the Israeli election since there were Arab guests , according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; the country was not listed among the countries , which can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
write a short review ( required )
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel through its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel recep@@ tion@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; Sho@@ cked him &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was an &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it was , in the director , even more fur@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
&quot; the fact that this hotel chain is located in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even greater shame . &quot;
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather big reson@@ ance on the internet , where people called it a scandal . &quot;
some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been an alleged invitation to the Arab guests .
&quot; ash@@ amed , &quot; said it in a different post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a syn@@ agogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel soon showed all accus@@ ations of itself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; view &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter into the fast @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading sum@@ m@@ aries between Moscow and Teheran have increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , interest in Russian businesses in the country grew strongly in the country , the ambassador said . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new firms are willing to access the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , further commercial building is one of the biggest priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trading transaction between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 % compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign agency reported about 3@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to preserve the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Championships in March , despite the return of Ho@@ ys . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an exec@@ ution@@ er .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots that was now un@@ folding .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y vict@@ orious - and Sk@@ inner set an olymp@@ ic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap was short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner kept it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a big part of the transformation , in which execution was going into a higher speed in order to slow it down and to allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell down Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make me a name .
we set an olymp@@ ic record in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeated the world champions .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ y , Hin@@ derer was clearly on the track after a weak start . &quot;
&quot; he with@@ drew this statement later , and there was no claim of England rivals . &quot;
&quot; with such a great victory this time , there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; It feels like all the UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we are so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to get back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , seven of ten titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months , we anticip@@ ate successful five days in the Vel@@ o@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the field of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was born just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly sacred date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) were born . &quot;
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medal in the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilomet@@ re race . &quot;
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the finish . &quot;
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot;
&quot; he had fought before the qualification yesterday , when he called him function@@ aries to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding Women &apos;s Competition , continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team relies on his strong web team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a bunch of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were down . &quot;
&quot; Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April surrounded by sex@@ ism and bul@@ lying allegations as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom competition , it looks like the now legendary call GB@@ s , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;

&quot; this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ amine with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company Ci@@ tic and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;

&quot; in recent years , more &quot; celeb@@ rities who model@@ n &quot; are &quot; models , celeb@@ rities &quot; are on the cover . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the small chance that Ms. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation , is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything goes on J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who draw up in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been a bit ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner , and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did , critic@@ ised her &quot; &quot; The Mist@@ akes of the Moment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these feelings were again high when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .

&quot; the director of the community centre of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Union of Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ ors was revealed , that thousands of people were rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a aboli@@ tion of the decision of the federal government would only be even worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centre centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need will be rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and op@@ pressive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dischar@@ ged un@@ just@@ ly - all these people have problems in a legal way and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the federal government will reduce the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people in need of Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the Prosec@@ utor and the Federal Justice Minister , as well as sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these mid @-@ cuts , so people need the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to national average . &quot;

&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps &apos;s campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action , after having been informed that their campaign leader for North Carolina directed a shot gun on a staff while they were in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment dated Wednesday by Vincent Bord@@ ini on Wednesday , a former software progra@@ mmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
Bord@@ ini gave up for months to wait for the matter to be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and put the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini gave in his charge . &quot;
&quot; after having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign leadership , Bord@@ ini decided that at least four more people had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he admitted in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; Bord@@ ini gave . &quot;
&quot; the indictment comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate , when he said a crowd of people in North Carolina , said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival should be elected by Hillary Clinton . &quot;
it was clear that the media had pulled out his words out of the context and that he would not be offensive to violence .

He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies close to He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities alone 10,000 new teachers will be able to create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too large . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ aged on the world stage .

&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked him . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 bn , and a legacy of skills and occupation both around the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walk branches . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of the UK .

&quot; in each of the two cases , when a person in the dark on the motorway was running - was decided that drivers would not assume that a pedestri@@ ans run in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper . &quot;

NASA climate model : Venus was once lived
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably hab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble clim@@ atic explor@@ ers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine if Venus could have created similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow transformation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ ratic atmosphere , and still slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and protected against faster ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow transformation of Venus is exposed to the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds creating a thick layer of clouds to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are cooler than Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution previously thought of plan@@ etary explor@@ ers .
&quot; although it was probably inhabited , Venus was exposed -- over several billion years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oc@@ eans ev@@ apor@@ ated and its water vap@@ our was blown away from the ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydr@@ o @-@ gen , there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect . Venus , as we know it today . &quot;

Patrick Roy joins A@@ val@@ an@@ che as coach
Patrick Roy joined the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday as trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations at Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
alternatively President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
it must also have a right to co @-@ determination with decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had ta@@ xed Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season , Roy was awarded the best trainer of the League for the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 . &quot;
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and at the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the low season in each of the last few years . &quot;

&quot; strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried on platforms in the North Sea , run by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ start the process of the present strike , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
we will keep some full day sessions in the coming weeks that will start next year to re@@ start the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group cut the rates to its tractors in the North Sea around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;

&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star enh@@ ancer of the Ple@@ y@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster are rotating at different rates , as well as in which context the rotation time rooms with the plan@@ etary formation are standing . &quot;
&quot; we hope to find out more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars cast large amounts of star@@ vation . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; if a star fails , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- det@@ ects .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ els compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower than smaller pi@@ rou@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; since the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is much more to us than we would like to learn more about how , how , how , and why stars slow down their rot@@ ations and to speak to their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ els and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
&quot; for the first time in the history of the World War , it was the first time that it was the first time in the history of the World War . &quot;
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing incidents have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metres ste@@ ep@@ le runner in Sil@@ vi Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish weight li@@ fters Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the critically acclaimed track competitions , these messages come to the end . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ othi@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday , which is used as a massage for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had finished fourth in the finals over 100 m butter@@ fly , just about 0.0@@ 9 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the events over 50 m Freest@@ yle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing was applied . &quot;
&quot; the national association accepts the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigation , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Tribunal of CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , it is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CA@@ S responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; in the night of Rio , the news about the positive test took place at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; We are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positively like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before the an@@ aboli@@ c Ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both best practice the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before launching the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is a further serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Federation had signed the entire Russian team up to an exception due to systematic dop@@ ing , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;

&quot; according to the violence in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have been worried about further attacks . &quot;
&quot; the state must be so@@ ber and determined , at the same time , to react to terrorism . &quot;
surely it is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and divisions .
we will not treat this triumph .
&quot; if perpet@@ rators need to leave the country faster , this will increase the safety and strength of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;

inter@@ cultural travel : cultural offers for schools

&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; , &quot; 19 students travelled between eleven and 15 years in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set up cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class were born between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg of Spra@@ gue , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without flight and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professional guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , playing and music . &quot;
children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical speech are planned in the planning phase .

relaxing night : tips against sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces
&quot; in the evening , you wake up in the evening , at night you wake up for hours , in the morning it &apos;s already far ahead of the wake @-@ up ring . &quot;
this is everything else than relaxing .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how do sleeping problems occur or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there are many reasons behind them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter we@@ eß , member of the German Society for Sle@@ ep and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in@@ som@@ nia and in@@ som@@ nia . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs . &quot;
&quot; not rarely , sleep disorder is an expression of another disease . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
and it can be that different factors are due to each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a disc failure , can lie badly , aw@@ akes every two to three hours and starts to gre@@ et about everyday problems and worry , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I take sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces to the doctor ?
&quot; if you don &apos;t sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights a week , you should go to the doctor , advis@@ es you . &quot;
&quot; imp@@ air@@ ment may look different : one is beaten , tired , tired , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to ease the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic s@@ laugh@@ tering only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin &quot;

this can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a bo@@ di@@ ly cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in case of snor@@ ing , doctors recommend snor@@ ing with breathing problems , in case of sickness , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
&quot; in fact , we do not have to prepare for the investigation . &quot;
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make mid@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after cab@@ ling , one goes to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a feel@@ er on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a camera on the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can those affected be able to get a grip on the issues ?
&quot; there are quite a lot of adjusting screws , where you can get a better sleep . &quot;
&quot; shooting counts : regular sleeping and up@@ time , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV to sleep , avoid drinking alcohol and at night , then you begin to count immediately , and that &apos;s quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;

&quot; at the first sight , the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not seem like this , but the police count them to the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one goes along the road from east to the west , one passes at play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; on the faç@@ ade of a grey house , someone &quot; ugly &quot; has jumped . &quot;
&quot; in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , it is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rent apartments will be created . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents of ten@@ ancy , on the ground floor , still occupied rooms and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin internal sen@@ ator Henkel recorded several times for a tough action of the police against the project , the area known as &quot; No @-@ go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ets , with 300 police officers were cleared , police pat@@ ro@@ yed three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the spot , locked up parts of the street and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owner are the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearing was illegal , and one day later police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ant of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street acts peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking pre@@ m late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , a basic school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ wing violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999 and Jana * , who runs here three children , are mainly gener@@ alised by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to bring about a majority of police protection against the v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin indoor sen@@ ator and the police clas@@ h between house occup@@ ants and their neighbours , does not seem to exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including nearly all the main@@ line street close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; during the Main@@ zer under large police command@@ ments in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and partly occupied by the people , which they had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in the last few years has become increasingly becoming mag@@ nets for tourists and poll@@ ing liners from around the world . now residents from G@@ DR times and former home occup@@ ants share their neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development .
no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , statistics are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most important part of the criminal off@@ ences make tangible damage , which tend to be more likely to meet new buildings and fresh refur@@ b@@ ished homes . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house in a rented house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , who are certainly not . &quot;
&quot; the famous burning cars , too , are no longer available in Riga . &quot;
&quot; for the studied architect , her road is not a criminal law , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drag@@ ged into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that the residents returned to their street : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly demanded the interpretation of the city in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : due to fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings , which are pushing the old residents . &quot;
&quot; these are , in the end , con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so good are living here , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction , I can absolutely not gu@@ ise . &quot;
but what should one do if someone is never listening to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the residents . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who draws up , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub where bad about noise can complain . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an occupational therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain the refugees that it takes time and make it useful to bridge the time , for example with language courses . &quot;

&quot; therefore , the main and community volunteers will have to look out for activities and activities in the region . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they always have in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics is shy . &quot;
