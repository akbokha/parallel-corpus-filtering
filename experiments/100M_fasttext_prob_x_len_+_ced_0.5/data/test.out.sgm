<seg id="1">Europe's Role in an East Asian War - 9th August '15</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter-player in the gold-plated room of St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot do the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed to be ligny, and he hardly beamed heat, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had been so lucky, as would never be something bad."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shot of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was fuelled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall in the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it was even bigger, since it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the Vetropack rebuilding becomes difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks were carrying all the blame."</seg>
<seg id="21">"at the most serious, the accusations from leading officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria, which would be controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin got the excuse from President Erdogan to hear the excuses he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan takes first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been tortured by a failed coup d'état in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel agents and charter airlines will be facilitated when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Večsti, as follows:" tourists are long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the west because its reaction to the attempts to power over power is regarded as weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"for this purpose, the ongoing resentment of the EU membership negotiations and Putin - which is pivot to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara with security, that after the attempted coup d'état he demanded support for the elected state institutions."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, that even a deep-seated fear of regiments."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this splendid palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an" "alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that violate themselves from the West and have been badly treated and are now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they would not even have stripped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentionally avoided a question of its differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when the NATO member of Turkey shot the Russian fighter jets - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least agree with each other."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fire Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed his chief of staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of Putin's closest friend of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a statement of the Kremlin, Putin has ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been Deputy Vice President since 2012, was appointed to his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born 1972 in Tallinn's Estonian capital, he graduated from the renowned state-of-the-art Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin, it is (in Russian) that he later was a protocol leader and vice president of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on his appointment, he said to Putin:" thank you for your confidence. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of head, regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysticism.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest acquaintances and works like he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on TV, both men claimed that Chief of Staff left his own wish."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once had been praised as a potential president to once again lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin who are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said," It's true that I've asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to entrust post for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">"he is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the state security service KGB."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"as Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin would have violated the Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post has been taken by Putin's nearest allies, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the Queensferry Crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "deck blower", "which approaches the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 lantern cables."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry Crossings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a hot activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete pit for the deck, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the closure is a forward-looking high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installation of the last street pit section and its connection with the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the landing page."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very hot work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Heikel, as the tolerances in which the team worked, were tiny - on each side they only ruined a few millimetres."</seg>
<seg id="20">"fortunately, everything went very well."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's olympiamship in the tower and that is for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been with every summer olympiade since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly raisman, the Jülich and Madison Kocian, which is Catholic, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the head of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year we were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and the Americas."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as she expected unexpected but masterful gynectics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual combined competition event."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we are experiencing the top of this kind of sport, but no classes in the whole country do not look like."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the last five, because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnastics in the team. moreover, it is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality looks so that gymnastics will be a costly sport and gymnastics will be held primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnasiums lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to be inspired by the municipalities of aun innumerable young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, making a more affordable and easy-to-access training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in my events, we have offered free and affordable turnes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic), and national and international winners are trained."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality turbines that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to take part in sport, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of" Girl Power "by the wood of the Olympic team golds and thank you, so many young girls motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to start healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness leaves election fraud in Muslim territories</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year on dismissal of a government report for corruption out of office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is unknowingly ignored like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles attacks the police, election observers and Raththers to have ignored the evidence of election abuse due to" "hypersensitivity to ethnic and religion". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Communal Government, who is now an antagonist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier belts outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have a passport with themselves to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must only name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report suggests, not removable ink on the finger of a person, if they give their votes to prevent someone chooses twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"that serves not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture, which is associated with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets electoral scandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special indiscriminate court ruled that the acting Mayor Luton Rahman should be relieved after a litanei to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "in a cynical way" "and that he would have brought his critics into silence with racism and Islamophobia."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of a imitation, in which a person chooses someone else."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed concerns about the fraudulent letter of letters - if the older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to cleanse the electoral system, including conducting statements to prove the identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "as evidence it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exerted, especially women and young people in order to vote according to the Willens of the Elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or bangladean background."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there were concerns that... State institutions such as" "politically correct" "beliefs concerning the ethno and religion were knowingly ignored."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric addressed 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists will process letters to stop" "election harvest". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is drawn from Theresa May, requires harder registration checks to prevent that the electoral list is used for immigration and social assistance purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">"unremovable ink on a person's finger, as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone chooses twice."</seg>

<seg id="29">The police force the authority to set up deportations for election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">"according to the repressions of the People Act 1983 (People's Representatives Act 1983), a change of legislation was facilitated by the prosecution of the People Act 1983."</seg>
<seg id="31">Photography prohibited in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the election stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">"the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers, on comprehensibility, motivation for use, and new user requirements, with a view to improving IAB's web presence even further."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it" amazing, "that after the Tower Hamlets fall, no criminal complaint has been made."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court ruled Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litanei to corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty due to a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the inefficient" "shutdown controls" "of the voter registration departments of the Town Hall."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said," The court in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal. "</seg>

<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your predator."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approaching from behind, then you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the shot line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>

<seg id="7">"then beat him with his knees in the slightest and twist, while the attacker cometh before pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run, and move backwards while they set the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, technology is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and rotate it, so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent his immune system and littering of a serious test - by appointing some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk took off his course on a euro note, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a pull toilette and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before checking every object, he used an Luminometer to show himself and show us what it is going on."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of detecting the purging button of a toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr Wright reported with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he was distracted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his darms by travelling through the world, and ate wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to train stations to flushing toilets, the task posed his immune system definitely under one sample."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all kinds of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test smear showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometers of freshly washed hands are less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused, after its luminometers were more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "this comes the worst thing I've got in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers a really something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "Let us Ian call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is a global phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film director, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had aroused some of the things I had ordered him, as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to, they punish them and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>

<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho is slowly on its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data quantity: eight men middle aged, a woman, presumably around the 20), is a day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>

<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these record boards, depicted above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and ploughed.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was something too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true that those who buy records are more introverted and like spending time alone, adding:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who heard about the comeback and set out to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have guided, people usually have to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>

<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record last month, have not yet heard them."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player, which they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while I browse through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>

<seg id="39">"someone came just recently and said," "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radio-gilead sound board so that I can put it into the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>

<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>

<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it is so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the Republicans called the Task Force to live after them, that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information, while the investigation will continue."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports by the Chief Editor of the Ministry of Defence in the Gange."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Service Commission published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," said the Highland Democrat in the Commitee, Member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "said morals among analysts and" gave a moderately little room for divergent opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats gave no evidence of an intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts in terms of a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector, which were recorded after complaints from Centcom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Mr. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, admitted that the Ministry of Defense would not comment any reports of the Congress, while investigative investigations were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also said that" experts sometimes have diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have further effects on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"the accusations of the past year, however, rejected the question how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism in regard to the secret information about the Islamic State is more than ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, drafted a document on how the then government under George W. Bush had foreseen a small occupation force in Iraq and devastated a little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker after stating government points that the refineries held against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial position, since these provisional refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this knowledge, however, was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damalous commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the middle of the raage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a swift relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is served by the wristwatch to the swimmers to the triathlon."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue in the coffeeshop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a black flock of dimples, could have been under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, gymnast or even fencing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting for gold in the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade, the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast and may it take a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make modest arguments for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discerning charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was so sparse that many people, I had asked, did not know that it was an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the United States sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012, who succeeded in the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians to share for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charme, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear, for a clown school that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, which combines two sports, which essentially unites it."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"rising winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling motions (turning, real and salat) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are rated according to the official Olympic programme, according to specification, degree of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-and-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists in their pursuit of gold continue to go faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes down and back, upwards and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also another major objective in television transmission: the world or the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even add a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel at watching these games as a little tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an Atempause.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A downward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she pralds, seemingly weightlessly like an astronaut, goes upwards, then downward, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the Qualification and Endrons of Women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the ends as part of an afternoon session on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympia-mania they promise a peaceful, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objectivity of male athletes - as it recently proposed the male U.S. Turner, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fanbase."</seg>

<seg id="4">"it also brings his associates, who endeavor to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain the peculiar position that he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after taking the clarification of an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump ruined his statement on Thursday and insisted on the fact that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in contrast to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious."</seg>

<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there was peanut bread, gingerbread and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheap prepared to reach the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine to eat so many peanuts that they serve as dinners.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it has to be placed in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>

<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "stands out the ways in which the country went with it, no longer the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense issue, Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget: mysterious food such as bread and casserole were too staple, the casserole was a" "wonderful way of resisting food residues," "Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>

<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with eating, was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science was applied to food."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebra is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie usually only come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-haie will receive up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland shark floats along the ground of the Nordatlantiks, in an hour, on average, it is just 1,220 metres wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal speeds up to 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">This slowed lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at least from a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "madness," "comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, which means vertebrates a world record for vertebrates."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in fact, the evolutionary biologist probably assumed that Greenland's hay was stacked."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland's hay is hard to observe, finally they live above all in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers are aware of the lifestyles of the Greenland-hay.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time serpentine measures her when she equips six animals with a transmitter in front of the Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the bone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrols on the bottom of the Ice Cream and seek cadaver, which torhindered from higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Grönlandhaie fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch coming from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest Hai was just 81 centimetres long, while the biggest 502 cm is measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the length of 220 centimeters length, the lens core, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons; it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland-hay, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens core, resulting in cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-off-14-o'clock for a 493 centimetres long Grönlandshark showed an age of 335 years, while the record Hai with 502 centimetres could even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was well-known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers could assign the length of an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature age and its age was determined 156 years ago, Greenland hair with multiplication is evident at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalies live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 years old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon-tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is often running on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">"so, they mature later - and slower slower."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal feeds warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than at a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as much as possible as possible as possible as possible," explains the Evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should invest more in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raste last night in the Men's team sprint in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, who took his countryman Sir Chris Hoy to Eigen. the Jager made the legend proud when he stormed home to visit a victory of the favourites of New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Championships in March, despite the return of Hoys."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as an executioner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw the potential in the Scots that was now unfolding.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner set an olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap was short, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner kept it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a strategy change made a big part of the transformation, in which execution was going into a higher speed in order to slow it down and to allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell down Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," It's a flattering comparison. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I am just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set an olympic record in the Endrunde and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoy, Hinderer was clearly on the track after a weak start."</seg>
<seg id="21">"he withdrew this statement later, and there was no claim of England rivals."</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such a great victory this time, there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," It feels like all the UK flags on the grandstand like London. "</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We are so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to get back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, seven of ten titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we anticipate successful five days in the Velorom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kennys, it is in the field of possibility that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would mean for Kenny - who was born just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) were born."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," I enjoy this only for the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Hinder said," If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to knight. "</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal in the day but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They came in 3: 51,942 at the finish. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had fought before the qualification yesterday, when he called him functionaries to measure his body size."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding Women's Competition, continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong web team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a bunch of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April surrounded by sexism and bullying allegations as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom competition, it looks like the now legendary call GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably habitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble climatic explorers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine if Venus could have created similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow transformation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erratic atmosphere, and still slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry areas than de earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protected against faster evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent matter."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow transformation of Venus is exposed to the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds creating a thick layer of clouds to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are cooler than Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought of planetary explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably inhabited, Venus was exposed -- over several billion years --too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and its water vapour was blown away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope to find out more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>

<seg id="5">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, the residents of tenancy, on the ground floor, still occupied rooms and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, the Berlin internal senator Henkel recorded several times for a tough action of the police against the project, the area known as" No-go-Zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadets, with 300 police officers were cleared, police patroyed three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the spot, locked up parts of the street and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowner are the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and one day later police and construction workers moved under the jubilant of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street acts peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking prem late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, a basic school and kindergartens are located."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999 and Jana *, who runs here three children, are mainly generalised by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted to bring about a majority of police protection against the vandalous left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin indoor senator and the police clash between house occupants and their neighbours, does not seem to exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly all the mainline street close to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"during the Mainzer under large police commandments in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and partly occupied by the people, which they had occupied 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district in the last few years has become increasingly becoming magnets for tourists and polling liners from around the world. now residents from GDR times and former home occupants share their neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year along with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, statistics are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the most important part of the criminal offences make tangible damage, which tend to be more likely to meet new buildings and fresh refurbished homes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house in a rented house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, who are certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the famous burning cars, too, are no longer available in Riga."</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her road is not a criminal law, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately dragged into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason, it was also so important that the residents returned to their street: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly demanded the interpretation of the city in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: due to faceless new buildings in former buildings, which are pushing the old residents."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are, in the end, condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so good are living here," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction, I can absolutely not guise."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone is never listening to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the residents."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">"who draws up, should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub where bad about noise can complain."</seg>
