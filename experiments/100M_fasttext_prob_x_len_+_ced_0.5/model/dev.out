Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friends .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and over Tehran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ sing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , it should also be about conflict with Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by Barack Obama , the Iranian nuclear program has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two . &quot;
&quot; in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republican Congress in front of the US Congress , which was partly as aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the time of the election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , to have shot his girlfriend , shot dead &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lam@@ b was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officers found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note made on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lam@@ b . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ sig@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lam@@ b did a fatal emergency call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took the life when the police interven@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , students and lect@@ urers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lam@@ b motivated . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators of both ends of the state have published details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; in his book , Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in a book written by him in which he shared the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History whose teachers include 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lam@@ b praised , he also seemed a bit excited and nervous , as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; Lam@@ b had asked the Delta State University to have a warrant for health reasons , and said that he had any health problem . &quot;
&quot; in this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest amend@@ ments to the university &apos;s employment policy were significant that the doctor@@ ate , for which Lam@@ b had worked so hard for him , would no guarantee for an automatic way to a job as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that can no longer answer the Lam@@ b .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police found later lam@@ bs when he entered into Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as again . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home at the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; Lam@@ b began his work at the University of 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he took a doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ term friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 , when they met by joint friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the wom@@ b of the wom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lam@@ b &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which borders on a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met Lam@@ b , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; after three years , Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail held both on a summer fair . &quot;
later they played one or another gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September last time , after Lam@@ b had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic aspi@@ ration before a tender audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lam@@ b had shot the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lam@@ m described his wife as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;

&quot; 8 Replies , showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious . &quot;
some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at this time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , of which no one has won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but outside groups like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C , and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ ump &apos;s stam@@ ina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it . &quot;
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary stage :
Tr@@ umps Any@@ where values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positive . &quot;

&quot; now , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
some three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week noted that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in a survey of CNN / ORC last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they would either be &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;

&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bomb@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to have the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality of a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively run his office , and almost six of 10 independent say that his tem@@ per doesn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; if they put up their money @-@ hats , Republican voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who will win the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee , after a survey of CNN / ORC from the past week , four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everyone . &quot;
some experts indicate that the broken field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ ump leadership while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ esting majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally at edge Paul , John Ka@@ es and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;

&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , over the company &apos;s claim of damage to the tax@@ pay@@ ers , or to en@@ force national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act did not comply with the Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ naire
firm of the Year for Anti@@ trust Baker &amp; McKenzie Firm of the Year for Banking and Finance CMS Has@@ che Sig@@ le Firm of the Year for Company Succ@@ ession and Tru@@ sts
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ naire and set himself for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up to face the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance from the media is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several Tit@@ els@@ pages Stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ gu@@ ish has drawn attention
&quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told BBC Two News@@ night programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ archy , &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ part of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspondent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour had to make changes to remove all the idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has given &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ nai@@ res are confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he has both &quot; &quot; perc@@ ei@@ ving &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ kers with re@@ sist@@ ors and instead committed itself to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow business minister , is represented by him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on the road . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the under@@ house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater &quot; , &quot; which is often associated with the question of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; since it was broadcast on television first in 1990 , the question was seen with the Prime Minister as the most important barometer of a leader and his leadership in the under@@ house and his position under his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms . &quot;

Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a sustainable campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di , the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia will strengthen its relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ amor@@ pho@@ s will be published further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices will lead its annual investor strategy day . &quot;
&quot; it is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia are almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA store stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states . &quot;

&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler w@@ akes up and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to improve selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products each week and to provide I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores faster and better selection of private label foods . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise as criticism of his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was replaced by the not@@ orious struggle of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rators : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Cy@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp@@ f turned out a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was stand@@ ingly defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK . &quot;
&quot; a thing about which I &apos;m fairly we@@ ather@@ ed , is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was a little in the dispute , He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke out of Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was a bit too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os at the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not all around the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the ra@@ mp , in which he can only think about it , I think it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;

&quot; chaos followed on the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Serbian officials with indig@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the street between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled down there . &quot;

&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister declared it &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would withdraw from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
&quot; the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc with a str@@ anded meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy . &quot;
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU countries would take more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary , however , did not set his hopes for an urgent action of Brussels or his neighbours . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , emergency rose in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country was building a barb@@ ed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison races were deployed during the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lay higher sti@@ pen@@ alties for traffi@@ cked human traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency state , &quot; said Mr Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters of Associated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country &apos;s security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that there were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody , and are accused of crimes committed according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia after a train carriage with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and expressed a crowd to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they arrive to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey

&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he can channel for the Presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supporters are consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .

&quot; while 48 per cent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them the candidate is , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;

consent to dealing with the problems and the constitu@@ ency are also quoted .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president has a potential for the Presi@@ dency in the Wa@@ ag@@ mire , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders .
&quot; as a result , Bi@@ den does not decide to channel the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this number has dropped by 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call for questions about the constitu@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; similarly , as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters voted to be unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate and potential candidates bring good results with some important characteristics in voters of their party elections .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best from hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as an external minister , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mostly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than 6 of 10 who say that their views of Clinton are worse . &quot;

&quot; Republican voters support nationwide dr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News debate last month , about 27 % in the survey of Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son shocked the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
&quot; the survey also showed that Car@@ son is well aware of demographic groups , and Tr@@ ump among republi@@ can voters with higher education . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ es , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ in governor Scott Walker , who died in the deep@@ est , and from 10 % support last month now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % on the third place . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the latest CNN / ORC survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son gets into the poll@@ s - he lands 19 % support in the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a glance at one of Car@@ son &apos;s last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ ebe for former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ umps in question . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder charges against five persons died . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to hospital what has contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and was repeatedly attacked while he tried to focus on a frozen field on a target . &quot;

&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the call number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gling his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to collect advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point , the members who hide the uten@@ sils and set the welfare of the Brotherhood basically about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ sig@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy test , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , hull and th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the ban@@ anas of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the Sch@@ ik@@ anen since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury from Mon@@ roe was indic@@ ted for murder of the third grade for the first five members .
&quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for terrorist attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has officially been officially or officially - this has been sanc@@ tioned , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a interest increase comes , and the household is advised to re@@ fuel , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
that &apos;s what we know .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest , and lasted 86 months . &quot;
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor of how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could find that all excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to this , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal ups but still at low levels to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic sho@@ cks that seem to fear many . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the advance of interest increases can make things for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets amounts to 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study on what has happened according to interest rates of F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ded later in the creation cycle , and the return of return will begin to decrease . &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest rate increases them often .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not be expected and that could accelerate the recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a interest increase in the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the nominal GDP has been less than 4.5 per cent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases with such a fragile economic backdrop might be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made the whole year on a interest increase of the fin@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ended on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all hei@@ ghtened cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that F@@ ed has been waiting for the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months . &quot;

&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is done . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the creation cycle , the bond funds fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to more and shorter bond issues , and lead to a defl@@ ection of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fixed Income analyst at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the earnings curve is flat , bor@@ rowing has increased and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and wide range , companies that wrap up the larger part of their business activities in the US will benefit from that when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt will be worse , as a rising dollar makes its products more expensive and the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months after initial interest increase , &quot; said Goldman Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have a low balance sheet after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 average by 5 percentage points . &quot;

Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims were gathered when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed , when a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand@@ mo@@ ury collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; the first of the dead , their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession took place in the Sac@@ red Place , where only days before a building crane carried out by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king left over the construction company of Bin Laden for the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 operators , who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mo@@ ury of Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram was from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane had under@@ gone . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who continue to come to the city will continue . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group should not stand the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was banned abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man laugh@@ ed to reveal what caused the fall of the sick , who fell into an inner courtyard of the Grand mo@@ ury , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place in this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree was also the group of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project that is run by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an ab@@ duc@@ ted son who was dischar@@ ged from the family in 1990 . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in a lifetime of every healthy society . &quot;
officials said that 158 people in the hospital stay .
&quot; government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were paid to the members of the det@@ ain@@ ees , and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;

the accused are not guilty .
one of them was also accused of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Attorney General Robert Ri@@ ffel &apos;s lawyer , Robert Ri@@ ffel was discovered that the def@@ endants were allowed to use funds from club accounts in 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
the sports facilities are also indic@@ ted for financial crimes .
&quot; this fact , the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , expi@@ red . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; in order to disc@@ lose the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence was that the association was not a part of an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports facilities were charged only allow@@ ances and the Sport@@ club , which took place from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 sh@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; said one of the accused , in the bread @-@ profession of the financial officer . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have proposed money to put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , it can only be done without any debt . &quot;

&quot; therefore , one part of the allow@@ ance damage was paid for years later , namely from 2003 when a plus was paid on the account . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the two def@@ endants shared the accounts and spar@@ es , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest in detail for the financial crisis , it was important to have been only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
the def@@ endants were acqu@@ itted .
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant , and was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; then he finally said , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened , nobody would have known anything about this money , the Prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; this bank transfer has been form@@ ulated as &quot; &quot; compensation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
why damage compensation ? we wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
&quot; according to this statement , the first def@@ endant stated that he had not agreed with this form@@ ulation , because the association never existed . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the function@@ ary , he never referred to a cent salary , he merely charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; on di@@ ets , he added 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual effort was however much higher , he added . &quot;
the def@@ endants did not show accurate documentation for the early years .
&quot; these are according to an operating test , in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer been kept , declared them . &quot;

time of the decision on interest rates for the U.S. staff
&quot; the world is watching , when the US staff is on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a bit longer and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historic event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday .

&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that it was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could not do it , &quot; &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lam@@ b , lect@@ urer for geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; He shot someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a result , Lam@@ b told the staff of the emergency call centre that police officers had to send police to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the attack@@ er after his name , but he didn &apos;t have him . &quot;
Lam@@ b gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police took the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lam@@ b , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lam@@ b 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police killed him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lam@@ b allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had their daughter &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lam@@ b for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lam@@ b have called for a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he does not go into prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later , Lam@@ b drove his car to the side , fled , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;

the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack of Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno during the 15 minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was burned in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .

&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;

for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;

&quot; it is one thing that all parents learn to learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost . &quot;
it is because you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the Super@@ camp , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to read my children , as it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead publi@@ shes a content of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of Th@@ ought @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams by reading her desire to see a real tree , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database , and it begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Vil@@ le , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron &apos;s action is so little familiar . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has read the Lor@@ ax not 20 times in a row in a row . &quot;
a down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Camer@@ ons &apos;s election circuit .
&quot; Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan to viol@@ ate the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der who selected England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in Batt@@ ing , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; this message : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the UK @-@ test cad@@ res , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this before - players are their best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopes for further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t have such good performances , and this doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first entered Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean , as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer that I appreciate . &quot;
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally from the team leadership in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of making Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would bring an extra @-@ spin bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , de@@ af , and I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed player has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous team mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the Op@@ ener in 2001 .
&quot; he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately , and looked not back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited partnership with him he was very impressed with him as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see its statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ der that raise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen themselves for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes with the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previous dar@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team records do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you have to remember that how players depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ published novel@@ ty strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of the ingen@@ ious Jeremy &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which is fierce due to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ n and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ ats fre@@ und said that some member states , so deeply humili@@ ated in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from its own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ ting contrac@@ tual changes which they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb@@ s on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who is looking for a great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it is bad for her as it is bad for her , as it has been done by the over@@ run as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ b@@ age ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also an allied force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nationalist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will rip a leg to help the Sel@@ fie British to prevent their energy from preventing the UK from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may not plan any useful remarks , in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend suspects . &quot;
&quot; the new trial was a P@@ lei@@ te , &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won anything from the new trial . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be on their cost , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the 1975 referendum in 1975 , who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who have made a name as a &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Straight Ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 90 @-@ he years . &quot;
&quot; at all , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ king , telephone @-@ hack@@ ed foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners , who have most of our great newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair thought about her , but noticed that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distributed ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of becoming a lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum campaign because Blair had rejected the principle of the EU adopted by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which was then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press also has never been able to do it .
&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fla@@ p on Monday in West@@ minster - I told him that he no longer need time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of 80 years , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but it has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just press it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional bl@@ ot@@ ting tendency and the wil@@ der plu@@ mage of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can certainly say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs strug@@ gled to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provoc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a poor idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet , without losing too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to struggle to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his associates and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on the Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bot@@ tom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe , allowing him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the campaign campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities in the EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities in NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not launch a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin have political capital ? - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be point@@ less ?

experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes were less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E published the &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the power rating of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
a editorial in the Lanc@@ et medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily v@@ indic@@ ative basis &quot; on PH@@ E its most important conclusion .
&quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) to introduce their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champions , some of which give some sector funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of PH@@ E also took part . &quot;

&quot; however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the PH@@ E report . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative danger compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ .000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs , which are not sent by other UK channels . &quot;
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller public , in hard @-@ disputed time window against the most popular shows of their rivals and Sen@@ ders as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried six years at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t want medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put his production at least on programs that others do not make or put on behalf . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs could be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both individual productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I have to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC are giving back what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they have been able to justify their seem@@ ing missions for justification of 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ ses@@ sive programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a time window where no one wanted to see them .
&quot; at the broadcast charge , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year here , but for people who have a lot of money for 150 £ a year , ask me if that is true because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should take a look at the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC , should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ casts alli@@ ances to make everything online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by dis@@ armament of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment when they have sound impul@@ ses , which have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard . &quot;
pul@@ ses work through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
HZ@@ I researchers discover control centres in Y@@ ers@@ inia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in order to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the Deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impul@@ ses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
thread worms are usually not responding to ultrasound but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles .
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves are used on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ish TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when ultrasound applied to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro @-@ b@@ lows and transfer them into the worms where they switch to the modified mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be revealed at a optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student resi@@ dences
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ sed smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
enter multiple addresses separated by commas and / or different lines .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you are coming , whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because im serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you wouldn &apos;t speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverage recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and get their under@@ wear . &quot;

&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble culture that can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I consume for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oly : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a non @-@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .

&quot; since you start the Uni at the cli@@ max of the Back @-@ Man@@ ia , the Klo@@ ps are at the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have something to do with you . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to close friends .
&quot; your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain , and will perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise . &quot;
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bak@@ ers . &quot;

&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it a drop of milk for your tea ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to themselves themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my ro@@ omm@@ ate , who added to her milk a washing agent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not only about being a constant person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to man who are sitting in the glass @-@ house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours , whether it would make them a bit more quiet , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
she re@@ acted with even lou@@ der music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and beg@@ ged herself to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would go to the same student residence by chance ?
&quot; on the other hand , it would not be very embarrass@@ ing if you are holding a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future marriage partner to get rid of them and then see them every day and maybe experience how they all move together ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes through its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to speak to your under@@ dog a little reason . &quot;

&quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;

Croatia is considering &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses

&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;

&quot; as the Croatian government ha@@ iled , the first refugees had already tried to tie in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the near corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;

&quot; in addition , buses from pres@@ tige would have led to the Maced@@ onian border that had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it would be the people to make certain routes : &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do this , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were the whole night of the Maced@@ onian border from Serbia around 500 kilometres away from Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has added , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;

&quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was decreased due to higher labor costs in cargo business . &quot;

&quot; on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ og@@ gan@@ i table to decide if it is time for the first time to lift the Leit@@ z@@ ins for the first time . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the galvan@@ ized , two @-@ storey seat sa@@ ver , there is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ izing US occupation and prices here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ equal third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the unprecedented incentives by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the rate of interest , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is contaminated by the financial market . &quot;
&quot; for example , half of the econom@@ ists who were recently interviewed by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted a interest in interest in this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets expect a decline in the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists will alle@@ vi@@ ate the blow by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintained the set in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at this point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets in order to avoid panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that interest increase would re@@ assure the financial markets , because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; even before a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the rate of 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first little step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that it would be necessary in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that would require more economic progress , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , improving on the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level that F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly under the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot;
&quot; but financial markets all over the world sent to the end of last month , after China had utilized its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 16 % below its maximum level , as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would boost global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat in this month , whereas Dow is now almost 10 % below the top of May . &quot;

&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the last few weeks would not have occurred , &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. staff . &quot;
now he is ahead of waiting for at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Currency Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .

&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly facing each other , the F@@ ed representatives can not only monitor the developments in other places , but also advise other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , leader of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
&quot; a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for a interest increase in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its lead rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; Lack@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis like the beginning of the 2008 market , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ence is not coming near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation in which they fear of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t believe that it should prec@@ ede the time . &quot;

&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary supplement that mothers should do . &quot;

&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ slip first and roof over@@ stand &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot;

&quot; in the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it turned out to be the bad@@ ness that is required for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan has no exceptions . &quot;
&quot; in the gym hall construction , however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ents &quot; , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym hall construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .

&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday , a total of 94 asylum applications were carried out on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two older people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees . &quot;
&quot; however , no one has any prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe Third Country . &quot; &quot;
the expi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .

&quot; in addition , the country has strengthened its border controls . &quot;
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were still in the country , but still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities on the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot . &quot;
mayor made &quot; rand@@ ete &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy at the bridge festival on Sunday , when suddenly ten people were at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to pass the train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly stopped the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow in Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the rods along with two further helicop@@ ters and their cars along the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we left the un@@ trusted guests only once again , with a break and drink . &quot;
we have said that we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; this was of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels , the str@@ anded train passengers had asc@@ ended to a regional train heading towards Pass@@ au in order to stop it after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still over the border . &quot;
the regional train was shut down before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high . &quot;
the bridge @-@ fest association with Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending another Z@@ ig@@ ram to us , is a logical result of an apparent policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , to help build structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor is officially officially and publicly the post@@ ure of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; even the poultry will find that the &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee influ@@ x and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for people seeking shelter . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad at the search for 3@@ 5,000 winter@@ ing Quar@@ ters &quot;
&quot; with the refugee , Konrad has full responsibility to do all his hands . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up Qu@@ arti@@ s for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already received a handle .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; even the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; cau@@ tious situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad is reck@@ oned with a need of 85@@ .000 quart@@ ets in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , there have to be 35@@ .000 accommodations in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the federal states . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already had conversations with the provincial capit@@ als .
&quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees of Qu@@ arti@@ ere . &quot;

&quot; but the grand@@ parents &apos; life was not free from tragedy : her desire to return to home , failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not receive Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ onic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the occasionally striking statements of the desc@@ endants .
&quot; this was repeated repeatedly over Mexican immigrants in the United States , and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born &quot; Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always up @-@ to @-@ face . &quot;

&quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up , if they are the one who received the last rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we work with Sarah Mack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given a hint of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood holds his lips to the final on Thursday .
&quot; all three women have left a ly@@ rical way out why Wood is the perfect man , and they called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as the reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers become a gam@@ ble who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki did both quickly - except themselves - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .

&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on the earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; from her point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the house visit last week became clear that Wood &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now working on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose the wood , if not she , she was enig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; four people , including a four @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police brut@@ alized a crowd against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , chief District officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside of a police station , some of you threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police had used tear gas and then poured into the air before leaving them on rubber floors . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rub@@ bers used , known to them that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ acc@@ i say that new provinces , which would be formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there was also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; in August , the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally regulated for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature has voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could step into effect on Sunday . &quot;

now the plans for a new cottage settlement at the little sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ the Council on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the FDP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of secret pris@@ ons , Ralf Behr@@ ends from the system construction management in the offensive : &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t yet got an answer to all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the members of the council and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
&quot; for months , it has been in the discussion for about ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; heavy reactions under sea bu@@ ds , who had come to the meeting , called the pictures and new details to the desired hotel construction . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ owner and board member of the interests of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro hi@@ eve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a huge kl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other bones . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears such a number of other project critics that the transport would strongly increase by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; there must be full bus loads so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what exactly is happening on the well one hect@@ are estate of the former inn , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans are still variable . &quot;

&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to € 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

&quot; for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a gui@@ del@@ ine for the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity has proven effective to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been carried out for people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data used in a study and comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach @-@ b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c training - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition dis@@ infected with 28 % . &quot;

&quot; the researchers monitored the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;

&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
HZ@@ I researchers discover control centres in Y@@ ers@@ inia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who undergo obesity treatment , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is located between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have joined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot absorb all refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama , and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke to the problem of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom , at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries on the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not adequate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; in order to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we need to reduce violence .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and commented George B@@ ush@@ s &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US took a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;

&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ lowed strongly alcoholic tra@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 are reported to report toxic control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children often come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children would drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or because of a sample of social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents said dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants mixed with alcohol @-@ containing mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ ected .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es , which are very attractive for children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in inf@@ ants , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency center at the University of Kansas , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from a cleansing inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school recently , was brought to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and stum@@ bled upon his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
&quot; Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ables , and to store hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition to alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death cases . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities assume that the product meth@@ anol contained , a fatal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in New York City reported their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teacher by po@@ uring anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , so it reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly sensitive to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police considered the dec@@ eit@@ ed plan as &quot; &quot; squ@@ ir@@ rel &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;

&quot; I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;

&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .

Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the publicity work of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;

his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .

Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing sports
Peter Moody claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he focused on ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that she had a personal campaign against him with the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last straw half on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax media that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself had found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ tu@@ ba test at Li@@ dar@@ is he could not explain . &quot;
&quot; he had returned 18 months because of sp@@ ying accus@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; see how too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing about it , and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot;
they know that it is going on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to move my head , and I would like to think that my owners are trying to try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more train@@ ers . &quot;
I have to consider what I do with my license .
&quot; before before , Moody had been able to leave the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department tried to spy on his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves to their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to grasp me . &quot;

are I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say to them now . &quot;
&quot; but I arrived at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert the pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the coaching levels of the train@@ ers have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching led to that he could have cast his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known by its preparation of the un@@ proposed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the day treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which was pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .

Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring matches &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ ce note to the storm team after his crew had achieved the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample example &quot; &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said they were only concent@@ rating on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers on his team was confident that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team . &quot;
&quot; this appears again and again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about Ring@@ fights , when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed our def@@ ective system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and this has provided us the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s really strange how this time comes up again to this season .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday evening , and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a divorce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we look as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and no points a bit stretching ? &quot;
&quot; for me , it &apos;s the game plans . &quot;
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will be able to meet them in a phase . &quot;

Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ accused in the port in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; despite a penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ caine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to have the whole lot and that in the café it could have been a harm@@ less reason . &quot;

&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 as a security to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ dav@@ it of the two individuals , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from being unable to appear , he warned . &quot;

&quot; the police looked around and saw the five images , analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used words for searching for un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g claimed against the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot; &quot;

&quot; he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , and he asked to send more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to attract them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and we@@ eping . &quot;

&quot; in 2015 , the compact car has to be seen , which is currently being sold particularly well . &quot;
&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of the new appro@@ vals were accounted for by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is reflected in the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new top @-@ class and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented in this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest pre@@ m@@ oring for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand in the fall of the dealers . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; if the volume model is sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents a step below the biggest competitor , VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra is available from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hesse also offer other diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is available only as a five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which can also be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be done next to the Astra at the IAA yet on new compact cars ?

&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior in this year , according to the statement by Assistant Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absorb a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated resolution in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create that and we create that . &quot;
what is coming to Germany is the following overview .
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 homes ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all in affordable rental objects : from 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing from the ten@@ ancy rate , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply for refugees . &quot;

&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister of Interior agree that there will also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction .
both assumptions seem unrealistic : for example , the impact of a global shock is likely to vary from one region to another . in this issue on regional labour markets , Norbert Schanne employs novel methods in spatial econometrics to describe and forecast their development . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them enter the entrance , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothetical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015 &quot;

&quot; while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the compulsory duty of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;

&quot; so far , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies show that jobs are most frequently communic@@ ated through personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the structure of networks is therefore a view from Thr@@ än@@ hardt on the way to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fle@@ dged parents give their children to Kit@@ as , approximately ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; for the parents , it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ en , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family to be convinced of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators increases strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacities - for example by allowing more specialist schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared without knowledge of German knowledge in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully educated teachers , but as in Berlin , as well as teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ack@@ le from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .

ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes position : &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t go well . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ ste &quot; &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , will be derived from the eyes of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal doesn &apos;t feel good , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the man@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest command@@ ment is : good for the animals . &quot;
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jumbo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud of . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ injured , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also accused by the claims of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats , and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had bu@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones , which they warned against Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalist to Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; it warns the Parliament members that the immun@@ ity ends in the Parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief spokesman said that Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says a statement of the company . &quot;
it is divided into a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the final Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation continues to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play it before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ ist scenario implies that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his story , his involvement in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had stopped the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then returned to his old momentum during the pre@@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury threat@@ ens not the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a bigger matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al &apos;s 157 Lig@@ ators in the last five playing times .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from injury , you have a prone period of time , a time when you strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body is stabili@@ zed , I &apos;m confident he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deserves . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia what means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and treat players who need to treat a little break @-@ up , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to go on by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake in Tuesday evening , measured at the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and is driven by far enough hope to lead the association to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
we are ambitious but we are not dream@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Comedy Show that gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ als among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably announced the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressive symptoms noted that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery have doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , lifel@@ ong and successful , dou@@ bles , even if the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at cost of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently announced , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality that sh@@ ook through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men can definitely get back to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of the phone pastoral care it told me : &quot; &quot; my listening roll for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ humili@@ ated , really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; I come with it &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone can help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest celebrating the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed setting , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;

di Maria meets PS@@ G to mal@@ m@@ ö Mal@@ m@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Mal@@ m@@ ö .
di Maria arrives at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Mal@@ m@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main was his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French masters to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or out@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected over the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t even have one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team , which was able to hold on his own place against Bor@@ deaux in the first league , but he was stung by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was referred to as the man who was taken to the next stage in Europe when he ran in the last month of Manchester United , and he interpreted why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defense , he was passing beautifully into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , who suggested Celtic in a Play @-@ off to achieve this level , entered the field with nine national players on the field and had a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five attempts alone in the first half , and then abandoned after the re@@ launch of Cav@@ ani . &quot;

&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , as they pointed out the need for alternative perspectives , emphas@@ ised the necessity of alternative perspectives and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it in the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with ins@@ ulting un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; as the comments of the actors of The Mar@@ tian are strengthened . &quot;

&quot; the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could shut down all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;

&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of the profit of the Great price of 1 million $ . &quot;

so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , money is the fastest person . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak at Minnesota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; earlier they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last spot in the American League Central . &quot;
IPTC : caption Parkway Drive live at the Greenfield Festival in Interlaken ( Switzerland ) on June 13th 2009 . IPTC : Copyright Notice Copyright by Shelley Jambresic .
the Tw@@ ins did a chance for Ascen@@ sion within a half of the Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League wild@@ card place .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit points out three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to concentrate entirely in the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits , and was in two R@@ uns , his first round since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has well sto@@ oped the bu@@ ck , &quot; &quot; said or@@ gas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to go back to the game . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who kidn@@ apped the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was that in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ps hit a double play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run to Detroit at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , the Wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ h@@ anders st@@ ach S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit benefited the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veteran , who had been kn@@ itting before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having been missing for a more than one month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started getting started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play the single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runner in the scoring position .
&quot; the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended . &quot;

&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t get very well beaten , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came three races with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z expi@@ red due to a breach of the throwing training .
&quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot;

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a well @-@ known place in the park was bapti@@ sed on the Opp@@ io hills on the name of the German Re@@ formers . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Kol@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the Protest@@ ant Chur@@ ches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in hiding their faith . &quot;
&quot; with the square , in a symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; he felt the city at that time , as an ann@@ u@@ ated sin@@ ner . &quot;
his negative impressions are likely to be encouraged by historians in his later struggle against Rome .

hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works , which Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his very personal interpretations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equivalent with &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary , the respective subjects are adapted , that can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic choice of the many topics of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles , which are subject to issues such as cross @-@ road , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments , or fa@@ ther@@ ing . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective bi@@ ble points . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible points of Ot@@ mar Alt , and translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bi@@ blical Stat@@ ues of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has gold Let@@ ters .
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; in the end , emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family which belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ wort @-@ Order . &quot;
&quot; since the up@@ bringing was already with the pipe , Ot@@ mar Alt recalls . &quot;
I have tried to work that in order to bring me back to the Lord &apos;s father .
&quot; his second concern is to help art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is today by rec@@ l@@ ame , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things .
pictures always have a bit of secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall into the images &quot; &quot; fall &quot; , &quot; discover and sense what force they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was held on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always has been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his images . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t care to capture the Bible completely , but also selected for him important , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; there was a picture Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and cloth pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;

&quot; the refugee drama goes everyone , nobody is allowed to take away . &quot;

&quot; in the past it was light , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he was on the contrary , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man , the fashion story , without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographi@@ cally chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall work , which was carried out for a lot of effort : to set up the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;

&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Plau@@ en to make a meter . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , for example , for blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; today , this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ ench@@ it@@ ze Plau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , the fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Plau@@ ener lace fashion , fashion played a bigger role , was then pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ tin industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls a number of examples : tip in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans towards past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , is an increasing job potential . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the ST@@ ICK@@ PER@@ LE in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we are introducing a quality seal , that shows that we produce ecological and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diplom@@ a designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger out@@ si@@ der of the West Saxon University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to counter the competition from the Asian space , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design will often only be easily variable to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was re@@ covering the historical snow chain . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sti@@ pul@@ ates small cu@@ cum@@ bers in some places . &quot;
&quot; the Plau@@ ener gold@@ smith master@@ in Bi@@ anca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Krau@@ ße was inspired by : &quot; &quot; before I was able to do anything with traditional Plau@@ ener lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate procedure , they pre@@ fers the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Plau@@ ener lace - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially for customers whose ancestors lived in Plau@@ en and its surroundings , and who would like to be a reminder . &quot;
&quot; in this way , I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plau@@ ener tip . &quot;

XI urges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy needs to open up wider out@@ wards to boost growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was entru@@ sted with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should use foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote innovation and promote reforms , new momentum and vitality will bring about and new space for economic growth , said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list of the provision of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified , which are not in question for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually being tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , as it grants the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarant@@ e@@ eing a right @-@ state business environment and open the market open , the statement said . &quot;
&quot; the government will also temp@@ t control over the powers of the company , and ensure that companies will decide how to run their business . &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .

EU wants mer@@ cury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , and to consumers with a significantly higher dose of nerve damage . &quot;
&quot; the Consumer Organization Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding paper on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; economic policy &quot; &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury each kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are so heavily poll@@ uted with mer@@ cury that may not be sold at the basis of the applicable limit values for about 50 per cent of the sizes . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; according to Food@@ watch , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ all is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ der defl@@ ation maneu@@ ver which helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a high @-@ toxic heavy metal that is strongly enrich@@ ing over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the Federal Government therefore warns against that &quot; small quantities of the nervous system have already been caused by un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Environment Ministry , the Federal Environment Ministry declar@@ es that a &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; is not expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury gets into the environment especially by coal combustion .

&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; , &quot; had quoted the &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; in March from the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mer@@ cury in fish already included the most common health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RAS@@ FF . &quot;
