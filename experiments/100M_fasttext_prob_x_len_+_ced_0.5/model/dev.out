Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ sing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critici@@ zes the ongoing settlements of Israel and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by Barack Obama , the deal of Iran &apos;s nuclear program has deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s invitation appeared on the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with a hint of the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , shot his girlfriend shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officers found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note , scoring on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I couldn &apos;t undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lam@@ b . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school site where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff had heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lam@@ b eventually made the fatal distress call after that .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took the life when the police interven@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lam@@ b motiv@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; in his book , Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in a book written by him in which he shared the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lam@@ b , said he seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lam@@ m had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lam@@ b had previously asked the Delta State University to appeal for health reasons and said he had some health problem .
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy , that the promotion , for the Lam@@ b had worked so hard , would not provide a guarantee for an automatic route to a position as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs lane when he entered the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home town on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said she knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; Lam@@ b started his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he has a doctor@@ ate in education in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of Lam@@ bs &apos;s long @-@ time friends described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 when she met by common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her guitar play . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the flock of women . &quot;
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lam@@ b said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , bor@@ dered to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had been friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lam@@ b , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared three years ago both on a summer @-@ fair market . &quot;
later they played together the one or other gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September last time , after Lam@@ b had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica aspi@@ ration before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his brother and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lect@@ urers , staff , students and members of the congregation at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says its response to Russia &apos;s strengthened military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will cause violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and integrate inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Secretary of State of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the Council of Ministers in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ tt@@ ed that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot;

some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in poll@@ s , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys conducted Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some are beginning to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at this time , Rick Per@@ ry@@ y &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , of which no one also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but accounts recei@@ vable groups such as J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary stage :

&quot; now , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa confirmed last week that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in a survey of CNN / ORC last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they would either be &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; happy &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they are &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say they are &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bomb@@ astic and ins@@ ulting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to have the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality of a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively manage his office , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; if they put their money @-@ hats , republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; after a survey by CNN / ORC out of the last week , they said four out of ten that Tr@@ ump was the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten ended July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everyone . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps leadership while Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ ap@@ points majority support . &quot;
&quot; in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ uns and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters support Tr@@ ump , say they have confirmed their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign two months ago , called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ist , &quot; was the Imm@@ igration of the shooting and fishing line in the public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bomb@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s key His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in immigration issues .
&quot; as long as the immigration in the spotlight remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do . &quot;

&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the relationship between smoking and tooth loss is due to more frequent gum infections in smokers . &quot;

Del@@ ik@@ ater folk by Su@@ fj@@ an Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; 11 years ago , Su@@ fj@@ an Stev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the pup@@ ular folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. State Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost caught by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
he tells the story of different places he always records on the map of what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate arranged songs are telling .
&quot; where they arose , and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; is the first part of an abandoned series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine @-@ proximity , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has been published and has a positive impact on certain expectations . &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns will be Deb@@ ut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ naire with tension &quot;
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to place the first of his six pre @-@ given questions briefly after lunch while his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision on Tuesday during a commem@@ orative celebration commem@@ or@@ ates the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several suspen@@ sions in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ archy , &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party was originally supported as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can be st@@ acked within Labour , even after Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements to the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has made changes to remove the whole idea of a restri@@ ction altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 ¬£ to 23@@ ,000 ¬£ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory head over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ nai@@ res are confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he has both &quot; &quot; pun@@ ish@@ able &quot; &quot; and the strings with ad@@ joining and instead made to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic Minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesman of the Unter@@ haus , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater &quot; , &quot; which is often associated with the question of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; since it was broadcast first in 1990 on television , the question@@ nai@@ res with the Prime Minister was viewed as the most important barometer of the ruling and his leadership in the under@@ house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics argue that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ ab@@ ank and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;

&quot; it is expected that Met@@ ab@@ or will publish more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices will pass its annual investor policy day . &quot;
it is much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shop@@ per stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves to be praised as criticism for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was hit by the not@@ orious struggle of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , whereby Har@@ rison had to beat Cy@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ f made a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is of He@@ aly was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against the UK . &quot;
&quot; a matter of which I am quite demanding , is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi has been drag@@ ged down a bit into the dispute , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket than he lost in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was a bit too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he is working very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gi@@ os &apos;s important decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he as@@ sures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part in the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all around the controversy around Kyr@@ gi@@ os , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think it is best for the team and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;

&quot; Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and ri@@ dden the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all parties trying to come illeg@@ ally to the country . &quot;
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indig@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations increased .
&quot; as a police helicopter above them , migrants attacked the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elled ins@@ ults against the Hungarian civilian police . &quot;
some pointed out food and water protest .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would return from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc had no common immigration policy at a str@@ ite meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would record more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; but Hungary , however , did not set his hopes for an urgent action from Brussels or his neighbors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , emergency status in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and ha@@ sten asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country - after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison bre@@ eds were used in the race to create barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also set higher sti@@ pen@@ alties for human traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency state , &quot; &quot; said spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ orters from Associated Press have already seen the border of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia after a truck with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressing a crowd to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
elections in Israel : Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s victory over the Labor Party coalition
&quot; the former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against ground . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ elled to the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have decreased . &quot;
&quot; their support in men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; but Clinton , however , has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with double @-@ digit advance in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections nation@@ ally say that they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;

Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to deal with the problems and the elect@@ ors are also quoted .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters of the elections are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders .
&quot; Bi@@ den does not decide to channel the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty percent of democratic voters see Clinton as nomin@@ ee with the best chances of winning the election , but this number has dropped by 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call on elect@@ ing voters . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters would be considered unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidate will provide good results with some important characteristics in voters of the elections of their party .
&quot; we regard Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the best from hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the elections generally regard Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as foreign minister , most of the Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say they have not influenced their opinions . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still wor@@ sen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton are worse . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders are filed against five persons . &quot;
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital which has contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to get over a frozen field on a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ ache , and he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood called not the 911 emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less , and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gling his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to meet the national president of the Brotherhood , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point , the members , the uten@@ sils , began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood basically on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injury to head , trunk and th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; at least one student dies at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen since 1970 , &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury from Mon@@ roe recommended charges for Mor@@ des third rank for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of terrorist attacks and formation of a criminal organisation . &quot;

this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a rise in interest is coming , and the house will fall into fu@@ elling , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;

&quot; the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to this , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at low levels to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic sho@@ cks that seem to fear many . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a look at the historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the advance of interest increases can be vol@@ atile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analyst in a recent study to what happened after the interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ded later in the creation cycle , and the return on return begins to decrease . &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often promote them .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and that could accelerate the recession . &quot;
this is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the F@@ ed interest increase .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 net interest increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made themselves the whole year on a interest increase in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the heating cycles of 1950 up to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing heights quickly turned into the shadow , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far . &quot;

the main difference is that the effect in bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is done . &quot;

the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates is that ren@@ ders move closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a defl@@ ection of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often deliver better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fixed Income Analyst at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the earnings curve is flat , lending has expanded and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed shar@@ pens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies that engage in the greater part of their business activities in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt will be poor , as an increasing dollar makes its products more expensive and the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; said Goldman Sach@@ s analyst in a report for the customers . &quot;

Saudi Arabia lands the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets in order to bury those who were killed when a crane came to Mec@@ ca &apos;s Gro√ü@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession took place in the Sac@@ red Place , where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the beds . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , as the Saudi King left over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family for the catastrophe that left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 beds , who were killed when a crane ran through the Great Central Park of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the Kra@@ n . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ington in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already noted that the h@@ add@@ lers are going to Mec@@ ca with thousands , which will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man said , the bin Laden @-@ group would not have had the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the tour of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man laugh@@ ed to reveal what the fall of the crane fell , who fell into a courtyard of the Gro√ü@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place in front of the H@@ add@@ an , which took place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden group had no statements about the collapse of the sick , and their representatives were not available for a comment . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also led the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they didn &apos;t cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Gro√ü@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
&quot; for decades , Bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to Saudi Arabia &apos;s rulers and takes over major construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rep@@ utable son who was appropri@@ ated by the family in 1990 . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in a lifetime of every healthy man . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .

time of deciding on interest rates for the U.S. bank@@ note
&quot; the world is watching when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reuters , found out that a little more than half that the F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and interest rates at the current stand from 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest paid on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alising interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars are added to balance sheet and generate a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the indications suggest that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;

&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house , but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; but will probably be upset . &quot;

Lam@@ b gave no explanation for his shots .

&quot; it is a matter that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost . &quot;
it is because you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental f@@ ables published in 1971 , chose Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the Super@@ camp , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to pre @-@ read my children , as it always seems to be a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all beautiful and well , except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book , instead draws an abstra@@ ction of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was born and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; a young named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes a young named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; even though he agrees to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the story of the book so little familiar . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read the Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row after a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s election office .
&quot; Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no other immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still hard &quot;
&quot; to push Pakistan into the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der who selected England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing installation , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in this case , Adam Ly@@ te reti@@ res from England test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ te is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are based on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - player their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is primarily a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer is given to set his character is difficult .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home@@ wards and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean , as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer whom I really appreciate . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ Factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on course of team positions in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of making Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would bring an extra spin bow@@ ler and received four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I did nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed bass has already shown that he is a devil @-@ player of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; he took three hundred turns immediately , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he was very impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for their youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team actors do not determine the schedule . &quot;
&quot; and you have to remember that , as with players , their jobs depend on the results . &quot;
such decisions are not made easy in heart .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ il@@ ateral re @-@ negotiation strategy to hold Great Britain in the EU will go deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the ingen@@ ious Jeremy &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which is sharply divided by Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ ate friend said recently that some member states , so deeply involved in various crises , like the EU it is now and not always out of their own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided that it would not like it if they end@@ anger social protection . &quot;

&quot; &quot; let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;

&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will pull one leg to help the sel@@ fie @-@ British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar trends have . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , some such ministers may even deliberately plan not useful comments , all in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process is pres@@ umed my friend . &quot;
&quot; the new trial was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain did not win any value from the new trial . &quot;
the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press level as it did during the referendum in 1975 but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .

&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Blair had rejected the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back@@ door . &quot;

experts critic@@ ise report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that E @-@ cigarettes less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
experts participating in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) decided to critic@@ ise the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; PH@@ E published the &quot; &quot; ground@@ breaking report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis &quot; on which PH@@ E set its most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) to synthes@@ ize their opinions about the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tobacco Resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding offered by Philip Morris International according to reports beforehand by the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um are not delivered , but several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champions , some of which also include a sector finance in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line of PH@@ E also took part . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; however , none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the PH@@ E report . &quot;
&quot; McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that &quot; &quot; there is so far no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes serve as a way to smoking children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System ¬£ 2 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;

&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and channels like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; said Johnson to the senior communications committee in the context of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think about a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least go to programs that others don &apos;t do or put on behalf . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach a wide range of support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give her right arm to it . &quot;
I &apos;m tired of seeing how this public television is supposed to be public .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership Apple iPhone 7 : inklusive Top @-@ Tari@@ f noch besser
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can reasonably be able to measure the audience , but they can argue if they are going to justify their seem@@ ing missions to justify 4 billions of broadcast fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; at the broadcast charge , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of us think that you get a great value for 150 pounds a year , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 ¬£ a lot , ask me if this is true because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should take an example to the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels of alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change direction in the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by erup@@ tions of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction of the moment in which they have sound impul@@ ses , which have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard . &quot;
impul@@ ses work through the activation of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers to read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasound but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles .
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves appear on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are allocated to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ions carry tr@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; if he uses ultr@@ asonic to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transfer them into worms where they turn off the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons using impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that has to be revealed on a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely because of the slow@@ ing of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then rein@@ stall them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged during updating or near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;

&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is &quot; &quot; solid earnings &quot; , &quot; considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in production and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday jobs were announced a day later than the rival UPS , who plans to hire 90@@ .000 to 95@@ .000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;

&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority ship@@ ments , which resulted in sales in his unit express shipping . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was due to higher labor costs in freight business . &quot;

&quot; on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strat@@ egen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ og@@ gan@@ i table to decide if it &apos;s time to lift the Leit@@ z@@ ins for the first time in almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey seating area , there is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues set the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the Central Bank has a t@@ wo@@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ even third mandate : financial stability .
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by unprecedented incentives by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;

&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led to the financial market . &quot;
about half of econom@@ ists who recently were interviewed by Bloom@@ berg have predicted a interest increase this week .
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strateg@@ ists reduce the blow by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintained the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that a rise in interest rates would calm the financial markets , because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the rate of 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in early summer that , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the stat@@ ute would be expected . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the levels that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
but financial markets all over the world sent together in the end of last month after China de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would d@@ ump global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , with the Dow is now almost 10 % below the high level of May . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; if events in the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy over the past few weeks would not have occurred , &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. staff . &quot;
now he pre@@ suppos@@ es that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in terms of decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .

&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they will not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also advise other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which seem not linked to the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ ner , authorized member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ates for a rise in interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives had revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market split , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence did not come near that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation in which they fear of a rise in interest because markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should hurry . &quot;

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ al organisation Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition during bre@@ ast@@ feeding .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation , which should make mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours . &quot;

&quot; the plans for the long @-@ long Turn@@ halle building at Bern@@ ri@@ eder &apos;s sports grounds proceed step by step : in the recent municipal meetings , the elabor@@ ated construction contract was secured without great discussions . &quot;

&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; , &quot; the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ enclosed first and roof over@@ haul &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; &quot; this way we get a wonderful large south @-@ roof , &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; liberation , &quot; again , the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation , which , for energetic reasons , was determined differently than in the development plan - to be below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; is therefore necessary because the development plan concerning the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation does not permit any &quot; exceptions . &quot; however , the Bern@@ ried Municipal Council is usually rather restri@@ ctive in fre@@ eing orders . &quot;
&quot; in the gym hall construction , however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;

&quot; tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly set up the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee current with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the stu@@ ds together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we have only p@@ aved the unver@@ i@@ fied guests , with break and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; this was of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in O@@ √ñ@@ N . &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man didn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels , the str@@ anded train passengers went to a regional train to Pass@@ au , after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but to try again over the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was shut down at the Inn of W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;

that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n now sends more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ cris@@ y policy :

&quot; even the refugees will have to notice that the &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; that they have been invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;

&quot; Konrad in search of 3@@ 5,000 winter @-@ solid quar@@ ter@@ ings &quot;
Konrad has full of hands with the refugee subject .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen banks to raise qu@@ arti@@ ers for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s first recording centre has already received a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; even the housing of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday , be without great fuss , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ threatening situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects 8@@ ,000 quart@@ ets in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , there will be 35@@ .000 accommodation in the next few weeks - 20,000 to provide the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but there is no ass without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the provincial capit@@ als , he has already held talks . &quot;

&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers have to hold a certain amount of towel holders or size of sky@@ light . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior when accommodation was successful , Konrad was founded with his experience . &quot;

&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : her desire to return to home in the long run , failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not receive Tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ atine History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film . &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shooting rubber attack on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber @-@ shells in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u capital . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , chief executive officer , said that over 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police had used tear gas and then shot into the air before turning back on rubber .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a lesser mort@@ al alternative , apparently produced such a high mort@@ ality rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern pla@@ ins , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ atur@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .

&quot; in August , the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been centrally controlled for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;

&quot; for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a gui@@ del@@ ine for the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity sur@@ geri@@ es have proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in humans that are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this surgery fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo surgery , 36 % dis@@ sol@@ ves the diabetes condition and partially in 28 % . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers monitored the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching higher returns in the BM@@ I ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and experienced a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit in surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die during the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conven@@ tionally methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit to survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all refugees , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama , adding that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the problem of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; in order to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like a real peace and true development , primarily through education that can be created for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the issue of violence , and also commenting on George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after 11 September , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;

&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low strong alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the toxic control centres reported , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming more and more frequent in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a sample in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very attractive for children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in inf@@ ants , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Tox@@ ic@@ ology Centre at the University of Kansas , the caster Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let loose whis@@ ky around , but people let these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants reach reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from after straw@@ berry shower dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally drunk with an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah got her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .

&quot; it was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ et@@ ers and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; in addition to alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death cases . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol included a mort@@ al solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in New York decided to poison their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zing and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
the police considered the dec@@ eit@@ ed plan as a &quot; gun &quot; and proved disciplinary measures to the school authorities .

&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; some later today , except for late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January through his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected will be watching it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ sy &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remind myself of all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a acc@@ uses me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined about her .
&quot; they admitted that &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulating &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I think there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think its execution is wrong .
&quot; and from this perspective , I will see him die . &quot;
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters that you can contact .
&quot; what you will get from me is what it means , a man to see an unnecessary death . &quot;

Peter Moody is claiming that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that she had a personal campaign against him with the late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last straw half on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions , as it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ ta@@ xing test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he could not explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept for 18 months because of es@@ pion@@ age allegations , and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot;

Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ red note to the Storm team after his team achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said they were only concent@@ rating on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers on his team was confident that they were worried about being hit by the storm team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have nothing to change in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and this has provided us the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team . he is probably not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this always emerg@@ es again at this time of year .
&quot; in 2010 , Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea was attacked by &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett &apos;s St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George has been critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a divorce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball game you want to play , if you have this type of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as these . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .

&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is reflected in the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented between all futur@@ istic concept cars and new top @-@ class and luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest pre@@ m@@ ons for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be held in autumn with the dealers . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the largest competitor in VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hesse also offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , among which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are among the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only five @-@ door variants . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kombi , which will also be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what will next to the Astra at the International Motor Show on new compact cars ?

&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the Federal Ministry of Interior , according to Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany even in the position to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create it . &quot;
&quot; what comes to Germany , the following overview will give you the following overview . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all in affordable rental properties : from 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing from the rental price , and in order to apply these very low @-@ priced apartments , refugees will also apply for refugees . &quot;

&quot; both assumptions seem unrealistic : for example , the impact of a global shock is likely to vary from one region to another . in this issue on regional labour markets , Norbert Schanne employs novel methods in spatial econometrics to describe and forecast their development . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial to find out whether they are working in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of migrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt . &quot;

&quot; so far , there is no sufficient offer of general and CP@@ D @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the construction of networks is the K√∂nigs@@ weg path to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; &quot; for the parents , it &apos;s only very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ en , spokesman for youth and family in Berlin Senate administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management hand@@ outs spread across different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators increased strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacities - for instance by allowing more specialist schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without knowledge of German knowledge will be prepared for the lessons . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully educated teachers , but , as in Berlin , as well as teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ okes from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .

the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ √∂@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually clean@@ se the same rights as they have the churches , and further develop the existing state church law to a new state religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is important for the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed about Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation works according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ ist scenario implies that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big dis@@ grace in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had to finish the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not risk the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a greater matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his knu@@ ck@@ les , or with the injuries he had before . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd posted 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six of eight game @-@ times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs were one of the two Premier League clubs .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue throughout the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns to a rotation within the team . &quot;
H√©@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and the players who need to treat a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ating effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten even after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala was measured 3.2 . &quot;
&quot; this year , it was the 10th in Zagreb . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and is driven by far @-@ reaching hope to lead the association with his first European cup victory . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .

Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever before , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) launched in 2015 as the year of the man , aims to ask the culture to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressive symptoms showed that when the suff@@ erer had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its focus on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , alive and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently announced , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but defined by his personality that spark@@ ed by interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing soccer , in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can relate to each case even if they are often reluct@@ ant to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of telephone coun@@ seling told me : &quot; &quot; my listening to people who feel de@@ pressed and are self @-@ em@@ powered , really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us , often feel unable to speak with friends . &quot;
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status on the phone can help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest celebrating the celebration of the day , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see in Starbucks someone sitting around , give him a smile and say Hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
di Maria meets PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Mal@@ m@@ √∂
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League , di Maria hits the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Mal@@ m@@ √∂ . &quot;
here are the game review and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept track when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main was the Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Mal@@ m@@ √∂ in the Princip@@ al Park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ √º@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards she missed a number of opportunities before she finally raised her lead as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A , Paris needs a strong start to the Swedish champion , as they are not only aiming for the qualification for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no class@@ less game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs . he later moved to his home town team and against the association with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to create problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury that could hold 2 : 2 Un@@ decided at his own place against Bor@@ deaux in the First Division , but he was pushed out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine wing stor@@ mer was referred to as the man who took PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis &apos;s pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ √∂ defense , he was passing away beautifully into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ √∂ , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off proposed to achieve this level , entered the field with nine national players on the field and was ranked with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was left alone in the first half of the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; however , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play and it was a Pass by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who turned the Di Maria into a shooting shot , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short of the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored its sixth season , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ √∂ could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before the waiting list Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later announced that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; for the last task , climbing was part of a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak at Minnesota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; earlier they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand at the final place in the American League Central . &quot;
IPTC : caption Dre@@ dg live at the Greenfield Festival in Interlaken ( Switzerland ) on June 13th 2009 . IPTC : Copyright Notice Copyright by Shelley Jambresic .
the Tw@@ ins w@@ asted a chance for Ascen@@ sion within a half @-@ half of Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , even for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit pointed three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw up any game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I will focus entirely into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designer @-@ designed tiger Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits , and was in two races , his first r@@ allies since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has well @-@ forged the impact wood , &quot; said Eli@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( stroke training ) , saw clearly better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to get back to the game again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who kidn@@ apped the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run for the second , Ver@@ hagen presented the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
it was that in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe came up with Double Play
&quot; after Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inside , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ h@@ anders st@@ ach S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit benefited the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three races against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been kn@@ itted against the game from the injury list after having been missing more than one month for a back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted to do , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started getting started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 success story with runners in scoring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ano followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; &quot; said Tw@@ ins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; he did not beat particularly well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever left @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three races at six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing training .
&quot; he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 . &quot;

Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Hogan Lov@@ ells
&quot; in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a well @-@ known place in the park on the Opp@@ io hills was bapti@@ zed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Kol@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith in the town of pop@@ es over centuries . &quot;
&quot; with the square , in a symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; he received the city back then , as a deser@@ ving sin@@ ner . &quot;
his negative impressions should be encouraged by historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold ) crown crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with magnificent pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his very personal interpretation of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motives . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary , the respective subjects can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles , which dedic@@ ate themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments , or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the painting with the respective bi@@ blical passages . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible points selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and translated into recent contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original bi@@ blical quot@@ ation of Martin Luther , each with a set of the artist , who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has gold Let@@ ters .
&quot; so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; in the end , emotions were finally the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hart @-@ Orden . &quot;
&quot; then the up@@ bringing was already with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work that , in order to bring me back to my Father &apos;s father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concerns are to help art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is now marked by advertising , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer fall into the images &quot; &quot; fall down &quot; , &quot; discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was a lover of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his images . &quot;
&quot; old didn &apos;t pay attention to fully compreh@@ end the Bible , but chosen for him important , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;

&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits . &quot;
I can no longer say that I &apos;m the En@@ f@@ ant of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his post@@ ure to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; For me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man , written in the fashion story , without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , which was operated with a lot of effort : to ref@@ resh the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;

&quot; it stands for the first , delicate , fashionable side@@ walks of the designer . &quot;

&quot; this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ aries Plau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Plau@@ ener Spitze mode , fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

that takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly variable to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ invented the historical snow blo@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sti@@ pul@@ ates small kitchens at some places . &quot;

&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;

&quot; new start @-@ ups to promote and drive reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not asking for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , as it gives the market a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a legally @-@ state business environment and open the market open , the statement said . &quot;
the government will also temp@@ t controls on the powers transferred to companies and make sure that companies will decide how they manage their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open government controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are being opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
