&quot; a ) In carrying out safegu@@ ards according to this Convention , the technological development is taken into account in the field of securing measures , and all efforts are made to ensure optimal cost effectiveness and the use of the principle of effective securing surveillance of the river of nuclear material , which according to this Convention is subject to certain strategic points , as far as current or future technology makes this possible . &quot;
&quot; B ) To ensure optimum cost effectiveness , for example , the following procedures are applied : I ) spatial finger assistance as a means for determining the material balance zones for the purposes of accounting ; &quot;
&quot; III ) Con@@ centr@@ ation of the testing procedures to the phases of the fuel cycle , which could be manufactured , processing , use and storage of nuclear material from which without further nuclear weapons and other core explo@@ sives , and the greater possible restriction of the verification process in other core material , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) To effectively implement the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention , the Organization of Organization in accordance with this Convention provides information on core material that is subject to securing measures , and on the characteristics of the systems that are for the implementation of the securing measures regarding this material of concern . &quot;
B ) The organisation requires only the minimum of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its duties according to the Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on equipment is limited to the minimum , which is necessary for the use of security measures relating to core material that is subject to the safegu@@ ards under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) At the request of the Community , the organization is ready to examine contact data that the community considers to be particularly vulnerable , in the premises of the community . &quot;
these data do not require the organisation to be materi@@ ally superf@@ lu@@ ous unless they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community .
a ) i ) The organization brings the consent of the Community and States to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) With@@ aboli@@ shing the Community either against proposed denom@@ ination or at any time against an eff@@ ected denom@@ ination , the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative nom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; in consequence of the repeated ref@@ usal of the Community to agree to the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which is designated as &quot; the General Director &quot; in the following as &quot; the General Director , &quot; with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
B ) The Community and the States concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually fulfil them according to their agreement .
( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged so that i ) are the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and disturb@@ ance for the community and the states and for which peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the Organization for knowledge of confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and balances as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other function@@ aries , the tasks under this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures under this Convention are termin@@ ated in relation to nuclear materials , when the community and the organization realize that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable or practically non @-@ profitable . &quot;
&quot; according to this Convention , the Community noti@@ fies the transfer of core material from the states which are subject to the safegu@@ ards under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the safegu@@ ards pursuant to this Convention shall be termin@@ ated with regard to the core material as soon as the recipient state , as fores@@ een in the Convention , has taken over responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents from which any transfer , and if necessary , the re @-@ application of the safegu@@ ards to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; the association with the organisation of such use of the material , under which circumstances the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention can be termin@@ ated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material will not be used for the production of nuclear weapons and other core explosive devices during the duration of the non @-@ application of the safegu@@ ards according to the Convention .
&quot; B ) The organisation and the community shall ensure that the backup measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention are not used for such a long time , when the core material is used in such an activity . &quot;
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under which circumstances these safegu@@ ards cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention will be re @-@ applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is kept up to date with the total quantity and composition of this material in the state or the states concerned , and on any transfer of such material from this state or the states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its agreement as swi@@ f@@ tly as possible ; it only extends on matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a secret knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the execution of their respective obligations under the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the association , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereign power , however , are subject to extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs if it has agreed in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the cost of all additional measurements and sampling frames required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states ensure that the liability for nuclear damage , including an insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with its laws and other provisions , in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the Community or State shall asser@@ t against the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the association or a state due to damage , with the exception of damage resulting from a nuclear incident , is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; after veri@@ fying the relevant information presented by the General Director , the Council shall not be able to verify that no core material required pursuant to this Convention shall reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II , C of the Articles of Association , and if necessary also the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in these steps , the Council respects , in which mass has been acquired by the measures used , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state , consult@@ ations on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that any questions arising from the interpretation or use of this Agreement shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any disputes , an establishment of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council shall be disputes resulting from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which shall not be agreed in the negoti@@ ation path or by another by the Organization , the Community and the States , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organisation also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth , who leads the pres@@ idency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization are not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for a refer@@ ee , the Community or the organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure shall apply if within thirty @-@ thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal shall be competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the arbit@@ ration tri@@ bunal are binding for the organization , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community , in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization stipul@@ ates that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention , and &quot;
&quot; II ) When the organization of the organization is listed , it is able to apply its safegu@@ ards to this state for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states are consul@@ ted each other on request from one of the contracting parties for a change to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The Director General shall immediately inform all Member States of the Organization from any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
&quot; a ) The Convention shall enter into force on the day when the organization of the Community and the States receive written notification , that their procedures for entry into force are completed . &quot;
B ) The Convention shall remain as long as the States Parties to the Con@@ tract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Agreement &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedure as required in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the objective of the safety measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of distribut@@ ing significant quantities of nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other core explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as det@@ err@@ ence from such a branch by the risk of premature discovery .
&quot; for the purpose of sub@@ mitting the target specified in Article 28 , the material book@@ keeping is used as a security measure of fundamental importance , verb@@ al with spatial integration and observation as important supple@@ mental measures . &quot;
the technical completion of the veri@@ fications by the organization is made by an explanation in which the material quantity for each material balance zone is specified for a specified period under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
&quot; when carrying out its veri@@ fications , the organization makes for article 3 full use of the Community &apos;s backup system . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of its securing measures , the Community will make use of the procedures and measures of the following types and , as far as necessary , pre@@ dict how they are defined in the supplementary agreements and are condu@@ ci@@ ve to : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , processed , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock of distant core material and stock volumes ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure for determining , testing and evalu@@ ating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essing accumulation of not measured continu@@ ances and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which points to the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes of this area , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
precau@@ tions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; ( B ) Ur@@ an or th@@ ori@@ um@@ per@@ ated material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nucle@@ us of the nucle@@ us , is introduced into the states , so that the Community of the Organization divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material unless it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; the core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , leaves the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured , or is this core material or other , in a later stage of the nuclear fuel stream produced in the states , it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the conditions mentioned in Article 11 are not possible or desirable , the organization and the community consult each other through the use of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community realise that this nuclear material is practically non @-@ profitable . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization exemp@@ ts the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 higher than 80 % .
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization exemp@@ ts nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to hed@@ ging measures under this Convention , provided that the entire amount of nuclear material liber@@ ated by this article in the States at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of particular p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
&quot; C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot;
&quot; liber@@ ated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to , processed or stored in accordance with the Convention , so precau@@ tions for the re @-@ use of the securing measures are taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets the organisation of supplementary agreements , which is required in the scope that is required for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organisation according to the Convention , in the individual as to how the procedures set out in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without changing this Agreement between the Organization and the Community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to enable these agreements within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report specified in Article 62 , the organization carries on a sum@@ mar@@ ised inventory of the whole , the hed@@ ging measures of this agreement underlying nuclear materials in the states , irrespective of its origin , and carries on this inventory according to the subsequent reports and the results of their veri@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the EEC has decided to contribute to the special transaction programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ pered by general condition@@ ality problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the goal of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound up within six months of entry into force of the agreement , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
d ) The EEC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the center bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EA Organization has presented a table that is inten@@ tionally intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; &quot; special transaction &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States have to contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement , and in this respect the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; in this agreement , and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special transaction will be se@@ per@@ ated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment takes place in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ its of the Member State , which must be paid upon request in the currency of the concerned state to order the organization as an administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the outlet of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment takes place in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 , or at another time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments before the aforementioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedure of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker occup@@ ies approximately proportional drawings on the cash or the school , in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction and to compensate for the special transaction . &quot;
&quot; in keeping with these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
III ) the extent in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit absorption capacity to loan conditions without reduc@@ tions ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly de@@ ferred development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is independent of whether it belongs to the organization &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices which are considered for the purposes of the organization funded by the organization , which is to be considered by the name b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of decent funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which have already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions which are generally valid for the organization granted by the organization ; therefore , they are rep@@ ay@@ able at 10 free years in 50 years . &quot;
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are rep@@ ay@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to payment of this clock are directly to the organization which it maintains .
&quot; each special transaction is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is specified . &quot;
&quot; revenues from any special transaction can be used for issues in the currency of the recipient country , or for goods or services that may be established ( ii ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and which , according to the stipul@@ ations of what the administrator has set at the time of loan agreement , may be the recipient of a special transaction . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted to the Member State as soon as possible by the administrator . &quot;
&quot; until full disclosure of all special transaction loans , the EEC shall be informed about the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the audit by the directors in preparation . &quot;
&quot; during the time of the payout of the special transaction loans , the Administrator direc@@ ts the EW@@ G quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses made for this . &quot;
the administrator transfers the E@@ EA as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external Audi@@ tor of the Organization on this statement .
&quot; as soon as possible , after full payment of the special transaction loan , the E@@ EA administrator will send a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and invo@@ ices from which the contributions to the special transaction , the amounts paid to the account and deduc@@ ted from the account and withdraw from the account to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the full expenditure of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time leads to an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes financed by special transactions or projects , and on all other issues concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation agree , do not enter into force , the agreement and all the commitments arising from this shall become due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the entire capital amount is paid back by the benef@@ ici@@ aries in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC pursuant to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States have notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings .
the Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organisation .
&quot; this agreement will be effective and entered into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch language , with each p@@ un binding . &quot;
whereas the agreement is concluded in the form of a letter to change the App@@ endi@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE PRO@@ C@@ ES@@ S@@ ING :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; referred to as &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Federal Coun@@ cill@@ or &quot; , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Federal Coun@@ cill@@ or &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program comprises the creation of a large test facility , the JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are named &quot; Joint Venture JET &quot; following Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty . &quot;
Switzerland has been dealing with research in the field of controlled fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area in question .
&quot; since until the practical use of the controlled fusion of nuclear fusion is still extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary over@@ l@@ apping and to accelerate their respective research , which have achieved a higher priority due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement aims at enabling each party to be able to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps , and consequently to avoid unnecessary over@@ l@@ apping and consequently the common aim of this research , i.e. , to achieve the common objective of this research . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the target of this agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Kammer@@ Programm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program acqu@@ ires long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or modified according to audit by the organs referred to in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this will take place at the place of the programmes listed in Anne@@ x I and II . &quot;
association established in paragraph 1 shall be realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; personnel exchange among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third @-@ states , &quot; as well as the laboratories carried on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; as part of the target of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the JET . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement stipulated in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this agreement , the contractual parties conclude an association agreement called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland , with the point of entry into force of the present agreement , takes part in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the JET , Switzerland is at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement to the Joint Venture JET , whose statutes it accepts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become the contractual partner of any contract , whose goal falls within the scope of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies charged with the implementation of the Association provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this Agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; the Association Agreement shall , in particular , include the implementation of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of research , and to direct the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom program - herein@@ after called &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the current or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , takes this task as to all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and establishes their T * sincer@@ ity in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common objective outlined in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss program , as well as to the scientific and technological developments in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives at the advisory groups created within the Eur@@ atom program whenever the competent Swiss authorities seek . &quot;
&quot; the advisory groups , which submit to the VG research proposals in view of the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task as regards all research and development work , which is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by the directors of one of the participating laboratories as part of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the Committee of Directors that super@@ vise the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and is responsible for the fact that the capacities of laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the program , are responsible for all research and development work under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of it between laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to take part in the meetings of all co @-@ ordination committees used within the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the coordination committees , which provide appropriate proposals for the best possible use of the resources , personnel and the knowledge and skills of the laboratories participating in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , apply this task in relation to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is a representative of each member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any third country member responsible for the core and energy research . &quot;
&quot; on request from the Commission , the Commission advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the preparation of future programs and defining their overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Board of Directors , the Advisory Service and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
VG &apos;s statement on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the Committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contracting parties participate in the work of all technical consult@@ ative committees or all administrative bodies created for the purpose of the present agreement .
&quot; according to this agreement , Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme is set annually to an amount equal to the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland over the past year . &quot;
&quot; concerning the JET , this contribution applies to the participation of Eur@@ atom at the Common Market as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland has an amount payable to the Joint Venture JET , which is defined in accordance with the Rules of Proced@@ ure of the Stat@@ ute of the Common Market . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom delivers to finance the work within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis , which usually serves to calculate Eur@@ atom &apos;s contributions to the financing of works that are carried out due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , with which amount to cover expenditure in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program is planned for the year concerned . &quot;
the Federal Council pays the Commission to pay the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are set in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures , so that Eur@@ atom of customs or other duties as well as import restrictions and restrictions are exemp@@ t from the part of the items which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , or where acquired items may neither be dispos@@ ed nor free of charge in this country , unless agreed upon by the Federal Council . &quot;

agreement in the form of a change of exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements at the same time as the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States as part of the medium @-@ term financial contribution
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by @-@ loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit an appropriate application .
&quot; the agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor land to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , which corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery budget funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; now , however , some conditions are listed below , for which application the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with every stand@@ by credit the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extension stands without exceeding five years . &quot;
the BI@@ S would charge a credit @-@ opening commission at the opening of the credit as well as with its long extension .
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawings could not be made before exp@@ ir@@ ation of a month after completion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liqui@@ dity . &quot;

in the form of a change of letters between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb
&quot; I ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are revised as follows : &quot;
&quot; fresh or frozen chicken , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in s@@ laugh@@ tered body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to guarantee imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina under@@ takes to ensure that the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to conventional offers ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change in the offer form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community claims the protective clause , she under@@ takes to ensure that the access to Argentina within this agreement will not affect the community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceeded the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end the import from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to imports of the products collected from this agreement to a cre@@ ep rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; with the admission of new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina will change the quantity specified under number 2 according to the size of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import duties for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the ple@@ dge rate of the exhaus@@ tion mentioned under number 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is determined with the day of the Greek accession to the Community on 23 000 tons of slaughter . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community is taking precau@@ tions so that the sales of intervention states on frozen meat are not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation the sales of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for expor@@ ting H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs shall be accor@@ ded with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these articles . &quot;
&quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a way which is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Articles 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention concerning the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular that the quantities of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement are issued for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community comm@@ its itself to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the gran@@ ting of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are specified in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ing of the import license for the goods can be dispens@@ ed .
&quot; it also stipul@@ ates that the responsible Argent@@ ine authority in the responsible position of the Community in regular intervals communic@@ ates the quantities necessary for export lic@@ ences , and these data may be required to en@@ code them according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly exam@@ ines the tendency on the hammer - , lamb , and goat @-@ meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including conditions which are of importance for the target given under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat must be carried out under the agreement not specified in the agreement . &quot;
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 January .

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honour myself to take the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to define provisions on impor@@ ting H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for hammer , lamb , and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep market and the export of hammer and lamb meat are exist@@ ential in the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , and that it is necessary to ensure that the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s hammer and lamb are not affected on these markets , I honour myself to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - Fresh or frozen chicken , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand will be assured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of access to the Community &apos;s market in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand Rec@@ ei@@ ves the assurance that the normal sales of its hammer and lamb meat is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand must ensure that the set quantity does not exceed the specified quantity . &quot;
the pre @-@ set quantities are carried out in the conventional forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
&quot; the Community affir@@ ms that with this agreement , New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintain its position on the Community &apos;s market . &quot;
&quot; if a change in the supply form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two contracting parties consul@@ ted each other before the introduction of such a change in clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community uses the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of imports of the products collected from this agreement to a cre@@ ep rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; with the accession of new Member States , the community in consult@@ ations with New Zealand changes the amounts stated in clause 2 according to the extent of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the import duties for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this is taken into account in clause 5 referred to in clause 5 .
the total quantity mentioned in clause 2 is determined with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community on 245 500 tons of slaughter .
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid market development , which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand ham and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community is taking precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention states on frozen flesh is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ hausen in the community without risk for market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sements or other support measures for expor@@ ting H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs shall be accor@@ ded with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these articles . &quot;
new Zealand ensures compliance with the amounts mentioned in clause 2 in particular by giving no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts .
&quot; in its part , the community comm@@ its itself to meet all necessary precau@@ tions so that the gran@@ ting of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the submission of a export license , which is given by the competent authority designated by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are specified in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ing of the import license for the goods can be dispens@@ ed .
&quot; it also stipul@@ ates that the responsible public authority of the responsible authority of the Community in regular intervals communic@@ ates the quantities necessary for export lic@@ ences , and these data may be required to en@@ code them according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the committee regularly exam@@ ines the tendency on the hammer - , lamb , and goat @-@ meat market of the two contracting parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including conditions which are of significance for clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat @-@ meat shall not be carried out under the agreement stipulated in the agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all questions which are presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement are valid without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified in clause 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount applicable by the entry into force of this agreement to the 1st January of the following year is set in proportion to the total annual amount .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty will be applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand , as well as for the New Zealand capital . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will take effect on 20 October 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a deadline of one year . &quot;
I honour myself as long as your government can agree to the foreg@@ o@@ ing that this letter and your reply will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area .
&quot; I honour myself to take the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to define provisions on impor@@ ting H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for hammer , lamb , and goat meat . &quot;

&quot; I honour myself to tell you that my government can agree to the foreg@@ o@@ ing , and that your letter and reply will form an agreement according to your suggestion . &quot;

&quot; in recognition of the fact that the implementation of the E@@ MEP has so far been made possible thanks to the financial means provided by the UN Environment Programme , as well as the voluntary contributions by the governments , &quot;
&quot; knowing the fact that the contribution of the UN Environment Programme is done only by the end of 1984 , and this contribution as well as the voluntary contributions by governments must not fully cover the costs of applying the labour plan of the MEP so that precau@@ tions must be taken to ensure long @-@ term financing after 1984 , &quot;

&quot; the preparations and equipment mentioned in Part II must be ster@@ ile , non @-@ poison@@ ous and non @-@ toxic . &quot;
it is recommended to add the devices required for inf@@ usion as well as the solvent for dry preparations .
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is that of a healthy human being extracted and mixed with a suitable anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant blood .
&quot; C ) which are not free from blood trans@@ f@@ usions , so far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; blood removal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ st@@ ened into a ster@@ ile bottle by a closed , ster@@ ile tube system , into which the an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ous solution was f@@ aded prior to sterili@@ sation . &quot;
&quot; after completion of the blood withdrawal , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it must be opened immediately before the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; quantit@@ atively , the an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ous solution may not exceed 220 ml per liter of human whole blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not exceed 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to be determined previously by the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the r@@ h factor is carried out by exam@@ ining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; insofar as there are standardized or recommended procedures for the blood group identification in individual countries , these are to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific tests have shown the non @-@ exist@@ ance of the anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E . &quot;
the blood exchanged according to this agreement should only be used for recipient of the appropriate AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is stored in ster@@ ile , sealed bottle against micro@@ organisms and can hold up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permitted only during the times required for testing and transport , which must be allowed to cool immediately on 4 to 6 C . &quot;
a concentration of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred where most of the plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been obtained ; other blood cells can be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water solution that was added after removal of the plasma .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ yst ) is to be indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the provision must be carried out using a ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively by printing . &quot;
&quot; an artificial water solution has been added , so it is also possible to specify its volume and composition on the label . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is obtained by de@@ hydr@@ ation of the liquid , which is depos@@ ited in the centri@@ fu@@ gation or sedi@@ ment of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred . &quot;
the human dry plasma is obtained by refriger@@ ation or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the fluid quantity , from which one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
the protein concentration of the resulting solution must not be less than 45 g per litre and the solution must not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products .
donations in which ( using a fresh sample ) have been identified by a risk of in@@ dem@@ ol@@ ym@@ sin or immune hem@@ mas@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine are excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours of blood removal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth in plasma , blood donations , the signs of a bacterial infection , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation has to be proven in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of the transfer of in@@ dem@@ nity to the plasma , there are mixtures which do not contain more than 12 donations , or apply other methods which are known to reduce this risk in a similar way . &quot;

these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C @-@ tigen only if the tested blood cells are heated up in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent hot salt solution .
the Tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 towards C@@ c@@ d@@ dee &apos;s blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object gir@@ ders in accordance with Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more people imm@@ uni@@ zed by the an@@ tigen I of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object gir@@ ders in accordance with Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object gir@@ ders according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating time is not likely to be lower in all kinds of red blood cells that show a reaction , not be lower than with the proportion@@ ate antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ tigen , which means that those of the blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ b and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that do not contain a A @-@ tigen , that is those of blood groups 0 and B. &quot;

&quot; A. This Protocol takes effect simultaneously with the Convention in force , if at least sev@@ ent@@ een of the States or Cust@@ oms or Economic Uni@@ ons signed in Article 11 of the Convention on the adoption of the Protocol to cooperate in the territory of the Cust@@ oms Administration . &quot;
&quot; however , only States or Cust@@ oms or Economic Uni@@ ons can document the document on acceptance of this Protocol , which previously signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication , or at the same time signing the document on the rati@@ fication or on the accession to the Convention or are depos@@ ited at the same time . &quot;
&quot; B . each State and any Cust@@ oms or Economic Union , the Parties to the Convention pursuant to the entry into force of the Convention pursuant to paragraph A , shall be the contracting party of the Convention in the am@@ ended by the Protocol . &quot;
&quot; it is a plant that is indispensable not only for the maintenance and conservation of so@@ ils , but also allows the exploitation of land which does not allow any other plant@@ ing , and even with extensive management that makes the main part of today &apos;s production , economically respon@@ ding to any improvement in cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DAR@@ AU@@ F , the existence and living standards of millions of families depend on their part , which in turn are completely dependent on the measures required to maintain and expand the consumption of olive products in the producing countries themselves and in the non @-@ generating consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; DAR@@ AU@@ F , that olive oil and Taf@@ el@@ oli@@ ven are essential ingredients in the areas in which olive growing is common ; &quot;
&quot; DAR@@ AU@@ F , that the essential feature of olive production is the ir@@ regul@@ arity of harv@@ ests and market supply , and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producer revenues ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DAR@@ AU@@ F , this causes all the particular difficulties to seriously damage the interests of producers and consumers and to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the general policy of economic growth in the countries , where the olive growing is custom@@ ary ; &quot;
&quot; the extraordinary importance of olive production for the economy of numerous countries , in particular the olive growing countries currently in development ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DAR@@ AU@@ F , that the measures required in the face of the particular circumstances of the olive growing and the market for olive products go beyond the national sphere and that international action is indispensable ; &quot;
