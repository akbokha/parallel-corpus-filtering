the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the study evaluated how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the trials conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as a solution for inhal@@ ation ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. vor@@ tex thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and ma@@ dness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients have man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( periods of abnormal mood ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and for preventing man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral mal@@ functions if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted to patients who take other medicines at the same time .
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among themselves . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l probably appears mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ vor@@ zo@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ vor@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ rence . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or similar illnesses related to increased dis@@ quiet@@ ness over a period of two hours with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased dis@@ quiet@@ ness , with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic drug ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment . &quot;
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for taking ( up ) .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients receiving A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short @-@ term studies than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms induced rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for inhal@@ ation ( ob@@ serving from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disturb@@ ances ( un@@ controlled swal@@ lowing ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sed@@ ation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and in which the man@@ ic epis@@ odes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ vor@@ zo@@ l , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the Committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission granted the approval of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union to the company Ot@@ t@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic epis@@ odes and their man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independent of meals .
increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy in treating schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors can justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the start or after replacement of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no elevated risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , conduc@@ tive disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if symptoms and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient with abili@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS or has un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of dying than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ vor@@ ous patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with respect to the deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy li@@ vel@@ iness observed and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting drugs with self @-@ lag@@ ging side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption ratio of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduc@@ tions should be made . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole results in the comparison with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism . &quot;
&quot; if one considers the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with abili@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduc@@ tions should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; after sett@@ ling the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be increased to dose level prior to the commen@@ cement of the esc@@ ort therapy . &quot;
&quot; dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with abili@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l per day did not show a significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ phi@@ c or@@ phi@@ c / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an rati@@ o. ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ raz@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ phi@@ c ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data storage , and because of the concerns that arise in animal reproductive studies , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a total lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with semi @-@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
some epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under semi @-@ operi@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term preservation phase for 26 weeks in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients was treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
there were no medi@@ cally significant differences between the patient groups on ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters were observed .
&quot; increase of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3,5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse Cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the introduction of the market , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dosing , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma cutting capability . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vor@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder via the combination of a partial ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine 2 and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ bab@@ 2a recep@@ tors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ bab@@ 2a recep@@ tors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ vor@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and D3 @-@ recep@@ tor and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ ot@@ onin , 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ cs and to hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ c Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , an D2 / D3 @-@ recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ stream . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who had a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions @-@ rates scale , showed a significantly greater improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of recur@@ rence occurred at 34 % in the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % among plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed an effective efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study , over 3 weeks with a fixed dose involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ vor@@ zo@@ l showed a efficacy in week 3 and an effect effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l also showed 12 a comparable percentage of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the management like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in part did not affect li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirror , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ vor@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term exp@@ ir@@ ation period of more than 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ sation stage before random@@ ization , especially in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ yl@@ ation of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ ulation is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean clearance time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in extensive metabolism via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a population @-@ specific evaluation on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reprodu@@ ci@@ bility , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the channel @-@ balanced potential , pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cin cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
&quot; in addition , Ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ lic met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the bil@@ e of monkeys , and are far below limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ th@@ fold of the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; single doses made of aluminium in folding cart@@ ons with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vor@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder via the combination of a partial ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine 2 and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ bab@@ 2a recep@@ tors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ bab@@ 2a recep@@ tors is medi@@ ated .

the recommended starting dose for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independent of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing abili@@ fy tablets can use the melting tablets alternatively to abili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorder was reported in some cases after the start or following changes of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) .

the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; for the prevention of recur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vor@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder via the combination of a partial ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine 2 and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ bab@@ 2a recep@@ tors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ bab@@ 2a recep@@ tors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study , over 3 weeks with a fixed dose involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
&quot; as a result of the precip@@ itation of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ lic met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of the hydro@@ xy@@ lic met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans , based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ th@@ fold of the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
abili@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended in the radius of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
abili@@ fy treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to abili@@ fy tablets or abili@@ fy tablets or abili@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused differently by schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure drops ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , conduc@@ tive disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with respect to the deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared with the intr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly study in the healthy volunteers &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l &quot; &quot; ( 15 mg dose ) and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption ratio of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in addition to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &quot; bad &quot; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduc@@ tions should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; after sett@@ ling the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be increased to dose level prior to the commen@@ cement of the esc@@ ort therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared with that after all@@ ot@@ ted Gabe from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo , or were classified in clinical trials involving or@@ ally applied Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term preservation phase for 26 weeks in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients was treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
there were no medi@@ cally significant differences between the patient groups on ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters were observed .
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3,5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances was the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances , the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms with regard to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the observed average improvement from the initial value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy was observed in terms of the overall population , but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who followed a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and semi @-@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sions @-@ rates scale , showed a significantly greater improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of recur@@ rence occurred at 34 % in the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % among plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study for schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , an increase of at least 5.7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in part did not affect li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirror , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ vor@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week course extension for man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ sation stage before random@@ isation , especially in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C after the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma pi@@ ckle is 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l Inj@@ ection Solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , resulting in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration of a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies of reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 mal ( rab@@ bit ) were about the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reprodu@@ ci@@ bility , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the channel @-@ balanced potential , pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore they have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects consisted of a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cin cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3- to 10 @-@ times of medium @-@ steady @-@ rate @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ lic met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the mid @-@ temperature @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in general , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
only the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time had no difference between the efficacy of the disease and the wor@@ sen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
patients may also not be applied in patients who have low neutr@@ ality rates in the blood before starting treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Abra@@ x@@ ane was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission informed the company Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 treatment can be broken down until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with reduced kidney function were performed and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data for reliability and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have considerably other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
patients should not be initiated by re @-@ abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven clearly in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac inci@@ dents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if patients suffer from the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or for women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoi@@ dable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , while and up to six months after the treatment , no child is born . &quot;
male patients should be advised before the treatment of a sperm @-@ preservation because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and ver@@ tig@@ o ( common ) , which can affect the traffic stability and the ability to operate machines . &quot;
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most eye @-@ catching important hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ( noted at 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , side effects have occurred which occurred in conjunction with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ icro@@ bi@@ al agent that promotes the formation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ m@@ eren and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhi@@ bition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in im@@ parts the trans@@ ac@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in vitro studies proved that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dot@@ hel@@ i@@ ale transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ um@@ tor and due to the alb@@ um@@ ulating protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two single @-@ armed un@@ blind@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III trial study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast car@@ cin@@ oma who received a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in the form of moderate pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el either in the form of moderate pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ meditation ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion with no pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
&quot; in the study 64 % of patients had a general general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ asis . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % only had adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 Results for general response time and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; first @-@ line treatment are shown below .
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one grade for patients , who experienced a periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy . &quot;
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous intraven@@ x@@ ane administration in patients with metastatic breast car@@ cin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase mode . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32@@ l / m2 ; the high distribution volume refers to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cular distribution and / or part binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dosage ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 , abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast car@@ cin@@ oma was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the Met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;

member states must ensure that the holder of the permit for the market launch is provided by the medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the drug ( technical information ) , labelling and packaging supplement . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also known as &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ circulation donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or for patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , em@@ powered to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with injection into a v@@ ein as part of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this trial had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the start of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also presented the results of a study where the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed , which were inj@@ ected under the skin , were examined by those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine like head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the regulations of the European Union , evidence has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;

&quot; the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ plex my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( for example cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger surgical interventions that require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used to reduce debt relief from a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults without iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
&quot; H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be applied , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients in which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and total disease burden ; hence the evaluation of the individual clinical prescri@@ bing and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient via or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the long @-@ lasting hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose which is required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application if necessary with an increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and total disease burden ; hence the evaluation of the individual clinical prescri@@ bing and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose which is necessary for the control of the an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ant of ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ l number &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the starting value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg increased three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ess of ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ l number of &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , is an indication of the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required should be obtained twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. several weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; on this occasion epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa must pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic hot salt solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into circulation . &quot;
patients who suffer from treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia ( PR@@ CA ) should not receive a Ab@@ se@@ amed or any other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esia known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ en ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , periph@@ eral arter@@ ial oc@@ clusi@@ on , vas@@ cular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ enia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of activity , it is defined as a reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ litre or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ po@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies are determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row should be considered a diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In case of maintenance therapy , the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in patients with chronic kidney failure . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is elevated above the concentration required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and avoi@@ dance of blood trans@@ f@@ usions . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ inal cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion failure should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 .
&quot; according to present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
tumour patients with chemotherapy should be considered a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ Gabe and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may have to be trans@@ acted ) .
&quot; if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 of patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the goal of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment , taking into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a greater electro @-@ orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should have adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting point of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that they can improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy returned if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was stri@@ ved
&quot; when epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in blood levels should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumour tissue , there is no evidence of interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al infections , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular complications . &quot;
the gene@@ tically modified epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ silicone and is identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that has been isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stim@@ ulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis was not affected .
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ og@@ bla@@ st@@ oses ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Hod@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ og@@ lob@@ sters ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 172 breast cancer , 22 prostate cancer , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal car@@ cin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; in 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 6@@ 83 breast car@@ cin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 300 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 other ) and 8@@ 02 patients with hem@@ og@@ blast . &quot;
survival and tumour progression were examined in five major controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival among patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and the control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common mal@@ ign@@ omas , a significantly higher rate of mort@@ ality than the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and satisfactory controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um level of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is much lower than the ser@@ um level achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the final gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ im@@ al fibro@@ sis is a known comp@@ lication of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the inci@@ dence of bone mar@@ im@@ al fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experimental studies with approximately 20 times the weekly dose recommended for humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to dimin@@ ished federal body weight , a delay in the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
these reports support in vitro studies with cells from human tumor tissue samples that are of in@@ secure sig@@ natures for the clinical situation .

very rare was reported about the appearance of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ ge@@ y after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ ge@@ y , it will break your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is the risk for problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or increasing potassium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels lie back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically clear cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or block@@ age caused by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to present findings , the treatment of blood poverty with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney disease ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood color@@ ant ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of blood graf@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past , th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous cavity or lung em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed looks like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can neg@@ atively affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if a greater or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic operation is im@@ min@@ ent , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the treatment begins . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood pigment ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed as there is an increased risk of blood graf@@ ting after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need specific blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means for building the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood pressure ( an@@ a@@ emia ) refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success and make sure that the medicine acts correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well set , regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distri@@ butes on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia respon@@ ds to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time prior to surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given at 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor regards this for appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure Ab@@ se@@ amed herself under the skin . &quot;

&quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the fridge and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or disc@@ ar@@ ded . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a sli@@ p@@ y hip frac@@ ture as in case of falling ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before first inf@@ usion , or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; admini@@ stering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days of inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain , and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme , the bone substance ab@@ rup@@ ts ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
in the study with elderly women the risk of frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) over a period of three years was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years .
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) , the risk of frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes occur within the first three days after the inf@@ usion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to to@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients in A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the infection point and oste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis ( mort@@ ality of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes provides medical inform@@ ational material that prescri@@ bes A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains cl@@ ues as to how the medicine is to be used , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The treatment plant • Con@@ tra @-@ indications in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired for appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing help &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes is recommended once a year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes is recommended for two or more weeks after the surgery of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the gift of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently developed low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes inf@@ usion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes can be reduced by applying par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes .
patients with ren@@ al dys@@ functions ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes is not recommended as limited clinical experience exists for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adol@@ escents A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes are not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under the age of 18 because data on un@@ objec@@ tivity and effectiveness are missing .
A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as there are limited clinical experience for these patient population .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cl@@ ava by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the gift of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental intervention , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of au@@ cl@@ er@@ xes can be reduced by applying par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( see Section 4.2 ) .
inci@@ dence of inci@@ dence of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 % ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ ORI@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) und@@ esi@@ red drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a reduced kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of the ser@@ um cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal range of oscill@@ ation ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , occurred at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get trials . &quot;
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the mor@@ row Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently discovered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local responses After administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion centre , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area have been studied , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ es . &quot;
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose in the max@@ illary region in a patient with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes and a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in the case of over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia can be achieved by applying oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either one bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal cord . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures were significant over a period of three years and already after one year the inci@@ dence of one or several new spine frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes patients from 75 years and over had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared with plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes increased bone density in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ ic acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with the plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase the lum@@ bar thickness of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the donation of 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vis .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume in comparison with plac@@ ebo and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture .
bone circul@@ atory mark@@ ers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) and the N @-@ terminal proof@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirrors were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the inf@@ usion . &quot;
the overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ ORI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes in comparison with plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D on the total pens and che@@ eks at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes treatment led over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total frac@@ tures and 4.3 % on the cock@@ le neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ ORI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ised 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the inci@@ dence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes compared to 8.7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( Study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ yearly administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes was studied in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially mild to moderate @-@ severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium ser@@ um level of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2,@@ 6@@ th@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison with the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain level and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six month trial could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 patients with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be sustained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ ed independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ iegel quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;
rapid bi@@ phase dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ bs@@ value time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early phases ( α and β with the above and ½ -@@ values ) pres@@ um@@ ably represent rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clearance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease in z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron @-@ acid concentration at 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentrations against time ) .
&quot; a reduced clearance of metaboli@@ zed substances by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans , and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabolic inhi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was in the 64 patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and regular ren@@ al dys@@ functions down to a cre@@ atine clearing up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid required .
&quot; as for severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal injection @-@ dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.@@ 6@@ mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C were 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in rats was determined by dos@@ ages of 0,@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C , corresponding ) , well toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application for cum@@ ulative expos@@ ures , which adequately exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and at intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an inf@@ estation that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low ser@@ um calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; decl@@ ining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is structured in an order that makes bone material we@@ aker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation , thus giving strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; to use A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you take drugs that are known to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes together with food and drinks , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes . &quot;

&quot; if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture it is recommended to carry the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes the patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically running , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ a@@ emia may develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently developed low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes . &quot;

compli@@ a is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more I
&quot; in addition , four studies have been conducted to over 7,@@ 000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for smoking cannabis . &quot;
&quot; however , no uniform results showed that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;

compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive illnesses or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported by up to 10 % , suicide rates of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant should not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the use of the treatment in an individual case predomin@@ ates the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; even in patients who - apart from obesity - have no disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other closest persons ) must point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• older patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the study evaluated how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the trials conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) that cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose .
&quot; in combination with sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ ane or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ hydrogen and insulin can be retained with the beginning of the treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , thereby allowing type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received either ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been reduced when using doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional contribution of Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ tic dy@@ e resulted in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional donation of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study that investig@@ ates the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 289 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had decreased the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturb@@ ances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ cris@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used for patients who may react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid level - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in for patients in which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficiently regulated and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , so the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( i.e. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserves . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one must not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T Mir@@ rors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , over@@ bau@@ ch@@ ment , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient continues with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be ag@@ itated by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ans , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a was reported with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescri@@ bing physicians should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients talk about disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthal@@ m@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events on bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) of patients treated with a comparative medication were treated . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants to get pregnant or if it occurs ( see Section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies investig@@ ating the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not exercise any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with pharmaceuticals that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ a@@ emia resulting in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data is not appreciated ) . &quot;
these lead to temporary modification of the tur@@ mo@@ or and refrac@@ tive index of the lens as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents across the thre@@ ef@@ old of the upper limit of the normal range were equally common compared to plac@@ ebo , but less often than in comparison groups with met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ dy@@ res@@ ins . &quot;
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p .
&quot; since the introduction of cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has often been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occ@@ ured at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not have any symptoms . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recep@@ tors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat , and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases periph@@ eral glucose utilisation in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years in order to evaluate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients suffering from gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was not sufficiently regulated despite three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ ol gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de observed values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dation tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease in groups with either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , with the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , pic@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in rot ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
&quot; the mean plasma @-@ elimination time of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite is between 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function , but the rates of the oral clearance of the parent substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ a@@ emia resulting in gest@@ ation decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased inci@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) were induced by the ur@@ inary bladder . &quot;
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ans led to an increased frequency of col@@ on@@ to@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) of patients treated with a comparative medication were treated . &quot;
in another study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were investigated .
&quot; in clinical studies more than 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dity tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial high tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study failed to determine its primary end@@ point , which is a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , an@@ amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not involve cardiovascular endurance . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events on bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative medication and more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medication , increased inci@@ dence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) of patients treated with a comparative medication were treated . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dation tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial high tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , both with an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to utilize insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c sp@@ y , which indicated that blood sugar levels were similar to other human insulin levels . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) , or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the dos@@ ages of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list of the packaging supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change with regard to strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ onic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin origin ) may cause a change in the dosage required . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less distinctive or different than with their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during the therapy and ask his patients always after other medicines taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) with an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) , or through glucose , which is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effective maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration amounts to up to 24 hours . &quot;
absorption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with a quick and delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molec@@ ule were taken into consideration ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may have to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transportation of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two kinds of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin has to be put up first , then the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 . if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General conditions and complaints at the administration of administration - Local over@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection point ) occur . &quot;

&quot; turn it until the pressure button is at the bottom and you can feel a resistance , then take the cap and set it up again so that the 0 of the metering mark is opposite . &quot;
make sure to press only during injection on the button • Ke@@ ep the pressure button pressed until the injection needle has been pulled out of the skin .
&quot; it may not be accurate • You cannot set any dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in cartridge • You can use the residual scale scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can not use it to set or select your dose . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of de@@ basement deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or rheum@@ atic no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ allo@@ ys which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atism cases may still occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic are still taking other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( plac@@ ebo medicine ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood was below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) in the last three measurements had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients suffering from allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart complaints in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
the treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently present gi@@ g@@ layer and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney impair@@ ment , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended for children and adol@@ escents as there is no experience in children and adol@@ escents .
&quot; as there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure the treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ury is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ dor@@ sal medicines , it may occur during the treatment beginning to an acute g@@ out attack , because at first ur@@ ic acid deposits can be mobili@@ sed in the tissue by lowering the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ seed extract . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to an im@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease Dur@@ ing the phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ ur@@ es@@ ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to the beginning of the period of the period and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ war did not perform any interaction studies on Feb@@ ux@@ o , but it is known that the X@@ O inhi@@ bition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line table ( an inhi@@ bition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous offering of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg twice daily with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ uses ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dosage adjustment for Feb@@ ur@@ ate or the other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C of D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ atum , which points to a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a t@@ ant@@ acid , the magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , which delays the absorption of Feb@@ ur@@ ate ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not include side effects from Feb@@ ux@@ o at pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when steering a vehicle , operate machines or during the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher inci@@ dence of inci@@ dence of cardiovascular events was observed in the total lin@@ ux@@ o @-@ group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1,3 vs. 0,@@ 7 events per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term review studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in

&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies were 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years long with Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all Feb@@ us@@ o stat@@ e- treatment groups and occurred in patients who received 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term matur@@ ation studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 either at all or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ li@@ pi@@ de@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short breathe , skin stain@@ s , skin stain@@ ing in the blood , decrease of the lymph@@ oma concentration in the blood , decrease of the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , drop in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ ine metabolism and arises in the context of the hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro inhi@@ bition , which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ tin value at the start of study of &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with commonly used doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the regular dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ seed extract to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit during week 2 and kept permanently over the entire treatment .
509 patients received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( i.e. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of the ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration in subjects regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ saw levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the inci@@ dence of g@@ out attacks , so that less than 3 % of patients needed no treatment against a de@@ fer@@ ment in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in grade no@@ d@@ ules , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out no@@ des by month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration became simpler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional . &quot;
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max amounts to 2,8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration was observed if this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma cutting binding of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 99,@@ 2 % ( primary bonding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration @-@ width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ies , these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are predominantly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ reci@@ cur@@ oni@@ d mainly arises from U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ ers in February , around 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ altered Feb@@ ur@@ ate ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , around 45 % of the dose in the chair were also found as un@@ altered Feb@@ ur@@ ate ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ oni@@ de of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; specific patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ of ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ of ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe Ni@@ bel@@ ys@@ function .
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moder@@ ately severe ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) , the C@@ max and AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ o and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
age No significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ o or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in elderly patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with approximately the 11 @-@ fold of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical application .
it was found that Feb@@ ur@@ inate in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; in high doses , which were approximately 3 @-@ times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by a reduction in the re@@ aring performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in bearing rats with ex@@ positions , which were about 4.3 @-@ fold and in supporting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were about 13 times of human therapeutic exposure , did not give any ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dosage adjustment for Feb@@ ur@@ ate or the other active ingredient .
diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no serious r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women following men@@ op@@ ause in which a risk for a small vitamin D mirror exists .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; da Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and Vitamin D3 have already been used separately from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in regards to increasing the vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with a low vitamin D level in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data that stated that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the same dose , which is needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( paraly@@ sis ) , supp@@ ressed abdom@@ en ( paraly@@ sis ) and aci@@ dic break@@ down@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any other component AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
it may not be used for diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or for patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. for the marketing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can only be taken with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a exists . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet before taking the tablet at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cus , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , can be given only with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , were rarely reported in patients using Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ ital@@ isation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end the medicine at the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn . &quot;
the risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , the stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw , commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime contains intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there is no data available to indicate whether a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate treatment in patients who require a max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take the tablet in the next morning after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after notic@@ ing their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ smus ) should also be adequately treated before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may affect res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait for at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials jointly with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate indicate no indication of directly harmful effects in relation to the pregnancy that embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the ser@@ um cal@@ ci@@ um increased to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ her@@ itance of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ agi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ ol to vitamin D3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D3 is the increase in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , ren@@ al secre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ smus , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ acia can lead to an increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : N = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in Phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.7 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.8 % at the chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction compared to plac@@ ebo group was achieved by 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients suffering from one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year prolon@@ gation of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 m@@ g. a day more than 2 years and subsequently 10 m@@ g. a day continue to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least a new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
absorption Be@@ ating on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate for women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after bed@@ time and two hours before taking a standardis@@ ed breakfast .

oste@@ opor@@ osis studies were Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate effective when taken at least 30 minutes before the first eating or drinking of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 Distribution studies in rats showed that after intraven@@ ous dosage of 1 mg / kg , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate temporarily distri@@ butes itself into di@@ gest tissue , but then rapidly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate approximately 50 % of radio@@ actively tagged substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ eces .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous dos@@ ages of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and system@@ ic clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys via the acid or basic transport system of the kid@@ neys and therefore it is not assumed that in humans it influences the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by these conveying systems .

&quot; the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine was 2.4 % in the urine after 48 hours , in the waste after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients with pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the portion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is rapidly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is present , the ren@@ al elimination of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in the animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced ren@@ al function . &quot;
therefore a slightly increased accumulation of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is to be expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ f are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ f or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a period of one year ( by exam@@ ining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or re @-@ absorption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
&quot; in addition , more recent studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation have been carried out and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any other constitu@@ ents may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs must be taken with Adv@@ agra@@ f at the same time as the Adv@@ ance dose or the dosage of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences between the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; change@@ over@@ s of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of law should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of impact and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level control ( see below ) .
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 the system@@ ic exposure was comparable to the level of the valley , compared with both phr@@ asing and liver transplan@@ t patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ents are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night @-@ surgery phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ance Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative phase does not allow oral medicine the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be taken intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for producing an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca .
&quot; duration of application For supp@@ ression of gra@@ ft rejection , the immune supp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - ren@@ al transplan@@ tation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . oral Adv@@ ance therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may later be necessary since the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change during the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted from a twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a mig@@ rating from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once daily the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation is necessary for the prevention of gra@@ ft rejection .
transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f is an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily once in the morning .
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients - although there is no clinical experience with glaucoma , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts in an oral initi@@ alization dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initi@@ alization dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood frac@@ tures in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it may be assumed that dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cre@@ atine level , a calculation of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
migration from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f when switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of blood levels in the whole blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of impact and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
&quot; the blood @-@ level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustment , alter@@ ations of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorou@@ gh@@ bred concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood count in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and transplan@@ tation and heart transplan@@ ts in 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that can occur in consequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ activity . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; change@@ over@@ s of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has been proven to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation advoc@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in order to pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and an atten@@ uation of the clinical effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver failure , infections , fluid over@@ load and oils . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons by suitable clothes or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturb@@ ances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption , special caution is advisable in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently increase or decrease the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels while offering substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was made with anti @-@ boy@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ri@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ Eyel@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the increase in blood levels primarily results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us caused by inhibit@@ ing g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute abor@@ tion reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors ; hence the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be metaboli@@ zed with medicines which can be metaboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious in decisions about recommended prevention measures . &quot;
the results of animal testing have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend its half @-@ value .
&quot; the results of a small number of studies in transplan@@ t patients do not provide evidence that , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy . &quot;
in uter@@ o exposure it is recommended to monitor the new@@ born to any harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effects on the kid@@ neys ) .
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( inci@@ dence of 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the tri@@ but@@ ary profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants is often not determined precisely because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following , the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 /

&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us cannot be di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is likely to be medi@@ ated through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell core .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhi@@ bition of signal trans@@ duction in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .
&quot; Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells depending on the T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recep@@ tor . &quot;

&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the major studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric clinical trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients receiving either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within the scope of 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us there was 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the emergence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 38.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients adjusted by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection , was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the frequency of the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
transplan@@ tation A multic@@ entri@@ c trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who were treated with pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized procedure Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level of level 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric clinical trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of the metabolism induced by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this can be concluded that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly occurs via the bil@@ e . &quot;
the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in case of stable patients who were killed by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .

&quot; advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a disorder caused by the lack of Factor VIII , con@@ genital ble@@ edings ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advoc@@ ates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suff@@ ers from a factor of VIII @-@ deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ sis has been &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the VIII @-@ deficiency , according to the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical state of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the Factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the course of treatment , a reasonable determination of the Factor VIII layer of plasma is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in their response , individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII , reaching different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the VIII treatment factor is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the delivery speed should be based on the patient &apos;s patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VIII , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to Factor VIII , where the risk within the first 20 expos@@ ures is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ treated patients ( P@@ TP@@ s ) with more than 100 expos@@ ures and an@@ am@@ n@@ esia @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;

&quot; in the largest number of patients , A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were all patients with previously untreated patients who had a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial authorisation , the CH@@ MP continues to consider the benefit risk assessment as a positive one , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ate , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) , allowing the company to withdraw its application for the use of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bone or the soft tissue ( tissue , which connects other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) of it . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified to carry a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and thus can trigger no infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tumour , enabling cancer cells to re@@ produce the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene , which is not defective in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing cells when DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer appeared in the abdom@@ en , bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company on the questions presented to him , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours brings benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the company did not sufficiently prove that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the Company did not notice the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; modified active ingredient &quot; means that the tablets are put together in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , through an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adol@@ escents over the age of 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cleared . &quot;
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy was the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all ha@@ y fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were reported about a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who took p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients with aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed an alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , m@@ outh@@ wash , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c substances or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( other medicines used to treat allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from acute glaucoma , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or a ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the placing of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking them , breaking up or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the lack of data on the reliability and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days as long @-@ term use of the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with time .
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy was not checked for this patient &apos;s objective and the data is not sufficient to give appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver failure and the data is not sufficient to give appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or head@@ aches ) must be dism@@ is@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the context of clinical trials involving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether or not Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is not inhi@@ bited in vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities relative to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans , and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor characteristics of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a deteri@@ oration of the traffic stability or the ability to operate machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; pain , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mi@@ tigation , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breath failure , heart rhythm disturb@@ ances , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , am@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturb@@ ances , and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary blood and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the Ad@@ hesi@@ on molec@@ ule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight effect , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg twice a day compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 took part in seasonal , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 414 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine ant@@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined on the basis of nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences regarding sex , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , conducted with formulation as a tablet in healthy adult volunteers , it was found that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin changed badly . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) from P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in after the all@@ uring gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was bio @-@ equivalent to exposure after applying an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reprodu@@ ci@@ bility , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
the combination of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic .
&quot; in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to alle@@ vi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets rel@@ ieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as ni@@ esen , running or it@@ chy nose and wat@@ ering eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the gin@@ gi@@ val anti@@ sep@@ tic drug p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contained in this drug . &quot;
&quot; swelling of the stomach or the du@@ oden@@ um , a bladder neck , bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ ms in the patient &apos;s history ( breathing problems due to a var@@ ic@@ us of lung muscles ) , a prostate gland enlargement or problems with the liver , kid@@ neys , or bladder . &quot;
&quot; inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed under the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • hyper@@ tension • heart ch@@ ase , heart beat • heart rhythm disturb@@ ances • nau@@ sea and head@@ ache or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or taken recently even if it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; in case of application in the recommended dosage , it is not expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or decreases the attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you should have a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you forget taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing , whi@@ st@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or r@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; falls of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach complaints , diarr@@ he@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness with increased physical activity , about cases of inflammation of the liver and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver damage was also reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 1 to 5 , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adol@@ escents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , and two studies in patients suffering from as@@ thma ) . &quot;
&quot; efficacy was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of quad@@ ru@@ ple , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body evalu@@ ates the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom ( symptoms score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the reduction of symptom multip@@ lies after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials to be effective in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin for adol@@ escents aged between 12 and 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the symptoms so far and can be res@@ umed after the symptoms have been removed .
in the per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while ing@@ es@@ tion of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to deteri@@ oration of the traffic stability or the ability to operate machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % of adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than in plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the Ad@@ hesi@@ on molec@@ ule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , administered in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was administered at a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flight effect , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ ese , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be classified depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall result of the questionna@@ ire on the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ Con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily . &quot;
&quot; as the hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with di@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness significantly as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients &quot; demo@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely eliminated . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is not inhi@@ bited in vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not depend on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ clinical trials conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reprodu@@ ci@@ bility , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken apart from meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available that support a treatment of inf@@ ectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical tests and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years metaboli@@ se Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and experience a higher substance strain ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children aged between 2 and 11 years is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
&quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ al@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as with the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical studies with adults and adol@@ escents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study in adults and adol@@ escents , who were administered up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged 1 to 11 who responded to an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adol@@ escents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adol@@ escents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ escents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was noted . &quot;
&quot; at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adol@@ escents in clinical trials showed no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults it was neither possible to increase the alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor to increase the drow@@ sin@@ ess .
&quot; in adults and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ ese , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall result of the questionna@@ ire on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively inhi@@ bit the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant substance accumulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adol@@ escents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were comparable to the recommended doses with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III paper bottles with a proof polypropylene connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ ystyrene tray , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparation with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
&quot; take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat in mouth once a day , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ s@@ ate dose can be removed without dam@@ aging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % of adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which were used up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was used daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg twice a day compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; for a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight effect , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ ese , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall result of the questionna@@ ire on the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ Con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients &quot; demo@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;

&quot; two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily lay in the mouth , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials to be effective when using Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin for adol@@ escents aged between 12 and 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be taken without dam@@ aging it . &quot;
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile provided in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablet proved to be bio @-@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat for the decre@@ asing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was used daily over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight effect , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poor@@ ly metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us , 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat , the form@@ ulations were bi@@ valent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , however , in combination with dose @-@ treatment studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg dosage tablets proved to be bio @-@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat for the decre@@ asing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was used daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; for a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight effect , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ ese , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg , melting tissue with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat on intake , the form@@ ulations were bi@@ valent . &quot;
the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting tissue resulted in this formulation an unlikely risk of local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .
the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in children aged between 2 and 11 years is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug . &quot;
the overall frequency of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; small children between 6 and 23 months were the most frequently encountered side effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
in an additional study a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution has not been observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
&quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see under section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ escents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was noted . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be dependent on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall result of the questionna@@ ire on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no bio @-@ equi@@ val@@ ence study was required and it is expected that it comp@@ lies with sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in various single dose studies , that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were comparable to the recommended doses with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company returns its application for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that could protect against a stem of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because people have not yet built imm@@ unity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine administered , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine , and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is able to produce faster antibodies in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane she@@ ath of the virus was cle@@ ans@@ ed with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as a body foreign ) , cle@@ ans@@ ed and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical examination and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution , but it cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; generic drugs should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily that can be taken twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of aspir@@ ation is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ a reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS cannot cure , but can post@@ p@@ one the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ a was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; using low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , enhanced medicines A@@ gener@@ asis was compared with other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors in 206 adults , formerly known as prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non demonstr@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the modification of the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but ag@@ ain@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in the case of children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults treated earlier with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , the viral load increased as effective after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 16 @-@ week treatment : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under ag@@ ron@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ asis may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ o@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a must not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines which are just as de@@ composed and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV there is a risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ phy ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of generic drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ a is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic rein@@ for@@ cer Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of generic drugs in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ a was originally approved in &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available for scientific reasons at the time of approval . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for the transit of asylum in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ is is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ants ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r twice daily along with 100 m@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses must be applied to veins ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of generic gases in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; generic term is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for reliability and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application should be performed with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients suffering from severe liver dysfunction ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ a must not be used simultaneously with medicines , which have a small therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ round@@ worm 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations which contain St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe life re@@ perc@@ ussions with potentially fatal consequences .
for the case of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of these medicines .
patients with previously reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of as@@ gener@@ ase and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids that are metaboli@@ zed via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; as the metabolic rate of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin depend strongly on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of ast@@ atin with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ulations ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available . &quot;
patients who take this medicine at the same time may be less effective because of decreased plasma levels of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ on content of the A@@ gener@@ a solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients receiving anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have been reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; many of the patients had other illnesses related to their treatment , which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial her@@ ti@@ ology is believed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ a must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ round@@ worm 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ asis with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed mainly via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for increased plasma levels associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; in attempting to compensate the low plasma levels by means of a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects were observed in the liver . &quot;
cur@@ rant ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um level of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r can be decreased by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rant ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , the am@@ per@@ avi@@ rus mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the cur@@ rant . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 508 % increase , for C@@ max decre@@ asing about 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
in clinical studies dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r twice daily and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily to prove the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment regim@@ en .
52 % degra@@ ded if am@@ pren@@ o@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r in plasma that were achieved twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are administered twice daily in combination with 100 m@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring since the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the sac@@ ros@@ ci@@ dal component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) there is no dosage adjustment necessary . &quot;
treatment with f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ fers and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine possibly lowers the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; should these drugs be used at the same time , caution is advised , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is recommended ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with ag@@ it@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with generic drugs in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but could increase the plasma levels of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole with 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other drugs listed below including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can potentially lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients should be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with generic drugs . &quot;
&quot; based on data from other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ fers , it is advisable that ant@@ acids cannot be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase , since it can occur to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti @-@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturb@@ ances , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of subjects , fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of as@@ gener@@ a with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in the plasma levels are expected to be administered at the same time . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to My@@ opathy , including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to monitor the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , since the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the simultaneous offering of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a@@ gener@@ a must not be applied together with the or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while still careful with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data on simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , as am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in the case of simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ag@@ ain@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ul@@ ant R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fying the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous use of generic term ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful consideration of the possible benefits to the mother when compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ o@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ o@@ r passes into breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; a Re@@ production study on pregnant rats , given by the ne@@ sting in the uter@@ us to the end of breast@@ feeding of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely lead to the treatment ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of generic drugs or any other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of veins treated twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were regarded by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed at more than 1 % of the patients , as well as occurring laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and oral fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated people treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din over an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 241 patients ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular @-@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ aneously within two weeks without having to break the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice a day together with low dose rite ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 3 and 4 ) were similar to those observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dose rite bread , very often occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures are to be initiated . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ o@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag pol@@ - poly@@ protein pre @-@ stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r is in the area of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r to HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhi@@ bition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral non pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved fossil @-@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were observed - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ten treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described seldom have been observed .
&quot; in six@@ teen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients who were not pre@@ treated patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 trial and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ia received over 96 weeks with the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resist@@ ence as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance on Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r and a reduced lik@@ el@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
&quot; based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clinical vali@@ dated ph@@ el@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ o@@ r generates a certain cross resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ amp@@ r@@ er@@ avi@@ r ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of treatment ) , one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / rite bread ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , inf@@ avi@@ r / k@@ night avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and ti@@ ram@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , am@@ pren@@ o@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early termination of a failure therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits which can affect the following treatment dis@@ advantageous .
&quot; evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( vir@@ us@@ load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) , with a PI , mainly with low dose rite &quot; &quot; oo@@ st@@ ert &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ a , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A @-@ PRO@@ 300@@ 17 sub @-@ study . &quot;
the primary analysis proved the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bund@@ led generic term is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children between the ages of 2 and 18 years of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was tested twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dose rite at the same time ; the majority of patients previously treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ asis .
&quot; after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Based on this data should be considered in the optimization of treatment with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; ag@@ et@@ ase .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % , on the other hand , lowered by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ o@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the administration of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; hence , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l@@ bs@@ . ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ per@@ avi@@ r that represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ per@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active component during the dosing interval in dependence on the overall concentration in the Ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit a CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 medium must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given with care at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ vi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ o@@ r is available in solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a solution and a@@ gener@@ a capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney failure is likely to be low to the elimination of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those of healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals with doses ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - multiple ( rat ) of exposure to man , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , there are little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vitro and In @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel testing of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation tests on human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical routine by measuring GH@@ F , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; previously , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of ag@@ ain@@ ase after the end of treatment . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality both for the animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ o@@ r .
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 When A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses must be applied to veins ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous application should be performed in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ul@@ ant R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available . &quot;
&quot; if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; 508 % increase , for C@@ max decre@@ asing about 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r in plasma that were achieved twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are administered twice daily in combination with 100 m@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring since the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is recommended ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with ag@@ it@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;

&quot; in the case of simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ag@@ ain@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ul@@ ant R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fying the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ rone ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother when compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a Re@@ production study on pregnant rats , given by the ne@@ sting in the uter@@ us to the end of breast@@ feeding of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during lac@@ tation . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures are to be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; on the contrary , am@@ pren@@ o@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; ag@@ et@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ per@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active component during the dosing interval can fluctu@@ ate depending on the total concentration in the Ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit a CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 medium must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given with care at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney impair@@ ment should be low to the elimination of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals with doses ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - multiple ( rat ) of exposure to man after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r . &quot;

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality both for the animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ o@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabolism paths are not fully mature so that am@@ pren@@ o@@ r or other critical components of formulation ( z ) .
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ a solution is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ants ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of the &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; &quot; ble@@ aching &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution &quot; &quot; was neither covered with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ o@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dosage recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a solution for inser@@ ting and low dos@@ ed rite bread , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although dosage adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ a solution for inser@@ ting patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ co@@ sis , A@@ gener@@ a solution for inser@@ ting small children and children under 4 years is contra@@ indicated in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhi@@ bition of the metabolism of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ a , does not prevent the risk of HIV from transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;

&quot; based on data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is unknown . A@@ gener@@ a solution for inser@@ ting may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of acute war@@ ts in the genital area , the cream is to be applied five times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is th@@ inner to the affected areas of the skin , so that it leaves sufficiently long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied at 7@@ 24 patients with small cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo administered either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; • In all trials , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • At the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c , not hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c ac@@ tin@@ tic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p with immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream is to continue until all visible incl@@ ine war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if in the follow up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely cured , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapeutic plan . &quot;
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in a thin layer and soak in the cleaned skin area infected with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ons until the cream is completely absorbed .
there should be a weighing between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a weighing between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host response .
in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed were observed two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a stro@@ pping leading stro@@ kes .
&quot; in case of an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which made a treatment necessary and / or led to temporary bodily impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , requiring emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; to the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied methods for the treatment of external tendencies in the genital and peri@@ anal area , no clinical experience has hi@@ therto been found . &quot;
limited data indicate a higher rate of incl@@ ination reduction in HIV positive patients . I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients .
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od inside of 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair approach was not studied . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions are back after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of treatment .
&quot; as currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment are available , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial cell car@@ cin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experience is present , therefore the application is not recommended in previously treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a smaller probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treating acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip@@ se within the lip@@ se . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ tic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently but these reactions usually decrease in intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
&quot; if the local skin reactions to the patient cause great dis@@ comfort or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; because of the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not result in direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the ser@@ um level ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um level ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) has been achieved neither after one @-@ time or after several top@@ ical application , no recommendation can be given during lac@@ tation . &quot;
the most frequently shared and potentially or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream in connection with side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the location of the treatment of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream in the related side effects include dis@@ comfort at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the Bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , most likely or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in relation to the side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
adverse events reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
&quot; according to the review plan , the evaluation of the clinical signs shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream often came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / ab@@ utting down ( 23 % ) and o@@ e@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the review plan , the evaluation of the clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , it was very common to severe ery@@ them@@ ums ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sh@@ red@@ ding and c@@ rou@@ ching ( 19 % ) . &quot;
clinical trials evalu@@ ating I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the accidental record of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , equivalent to the content of about 16 sach@@ ets , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically most severe side effect , which occurred after several oral dos@@ ages of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized following or@@ ally or intraven@@ ous liquid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , increasing system@@ ic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the tendencies in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
at 60 % of the 119 patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy patients were treated completely ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients with plac@@ ebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and stayed for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c , not hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c AC@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the untreated scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of external col@@ lagen , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ ficial cell car@@ cin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore were not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme has been studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) . &quot;
a minimal system@@ ic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cr@@ ème due to the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and weigh@@ ed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able pou@@ ch ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low according to top@@ ical application on MC @-@ ill skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ ficial cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out for four months for der@@ mal application resulted in no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with mal@@ er administration on three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the application point .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk to the human being is regarded as very low due to system@@ ic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice treated with the free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UV@@ R . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; the study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by exam@@ ining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentration in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal big liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , pain sensation , fever and reactions at the inf@@ usion centre . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of the lungs ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) . &quot;
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and if necessary , update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe BV to appro@@ ve Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ gh@@ ock of the Chinese hamster ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is toler@@ ated to increase every 15 minutes in single steps at a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined and for these patients no dosage intake can be recommended .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage intake can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment , in which rehabilitation centres for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 trial , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies form the form of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding res@@ uming the treatment after a longer break , it must be cau@@ tious due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
pre@@ treatment 60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of an easy or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the inf@@ usion rates to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;

&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular image of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase over mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended to not satisfy with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly observed as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under the age of 5 ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3- study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment period of up to 4 years are often listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , breathing breast and facial oil ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desirable drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months following the start of the treatment , with a severe form of ser@@ ene in patients aged under the age of 5 ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and over ) . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the phase 3 trial ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were unable to detect any antibody ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients , in which there was never a Ser@@ o@@ Con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with low @-@ low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in the urine . &quot;
four patients ( three in Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ ae activity in vitro that did not interfere with clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to stand in connection with the inci@@ dence of undes@@ irable drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire spectrum of the disease , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute path in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma showed an improvement in lung function and sal@@ vi@@ ability seen in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in the open extension study , improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks showed in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table . &quot;
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of G@@ AG levels in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was determined which remained constant until the end of the study .
&quot; overall , in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 58 % ) was observed , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and progression in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase II study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe form of exp@@ ir@@ ation and 4 with medium displac@@ ement ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dose was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks because of elevated g@@ ag@@ - mirrors . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium displac@@ ement form indicated a normal mental development rate , whereas in older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form , only limited or no progress in cognitive development were determined . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me dosing regim@@ ens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; dosage intake with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a mut@@ able alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , a summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to the patients suffering from older and less severely affected patients .

this tab is used to treat long @-@ term safety and efficacy information treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
&quot; in patients suffering from MP@@ S I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase which breaks down certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase has occurred .
an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you take medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain because a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me exists . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or taken recently , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for use - Thin@@ ner and application The concentrate for making an inf@@ usion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors or medical professionals ) .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased , if the patient is toler@@ ated , every 15 minutes gradually increases to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe MP@@ S I@@ - un@@ conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions have occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , breathing breast and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • head@@ ache • sickness • ache , pain in the arms and legs • Er@@ ro@@ ten • F@@ ill • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the Inf@@ usion Centre &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , or is likely to spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and for patients who previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid loss ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood picture changes or in which certain other side effects occur , treatment should be postpon@@ ed , decreased or reduced the dose . &quot;
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ ry slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from sharing .
&quot; the transformation of tel@@ emet@@ ers in its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer lifetime in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural agent , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with a local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin survived at an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.2 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , when administered by A@@ lim@@ ta , showed longer survival rates than with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. &quot;
&quot; each water bottle has to be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - radic@@ ally advanced or metastatic non @-@ cell@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion for a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after completion of the tel@@ emet@@ ric inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after prior chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the met@@ ry @-@ fixed gift as well as on the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of the medicine , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days following the final dose of the tel@@ emet@@ ric dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first endo@@ der@@ ine dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ ry , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking into account the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood balance or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , applying for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria conform to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 Blood .
&quot; should patients not develop ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient the value before treatment &quot;
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ tions a ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or continued in the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over the age of 65 years there is an increased risk of side effects .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data for reliability and efficacy .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustments were necessary which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function reduction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ ary limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row supp@@ ression and this is not allowed to be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et cy@@ te number again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neutr@@ ality of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and ni@@ chth@@ on@@ ous toxic@@ ity like neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia has been observed when a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with emet@@ ers must be instruc@@ ted to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure to reduce treated toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before therapy .
all patients who have been prescribed for treatment with emet@@ ri@@ end@@ omet@@ ry must avoid the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long semi @-@ lifetime for at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days following the therapy with emet@@ ri@@ end@@ omet@@ ry ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the refrac@@ tory treatment should be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials of tel@@ emet@@ ric hist@@ ories when this substance was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to the plas@@ ticity , men should be advised to obtain advice regarding the reduction of sperm . &quot;
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) can lead to a reduced dose of ster@@ ility of side effects .
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with emet@@ ri@@ pen@@ xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring rate of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ul@@ ant R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of emet@@ ers in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected in the pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to the plas@@ ticity , men should be advised before the treatment begins to obtain advice regarding the reduction of sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether tur@@ mo@@ dest@@ ine drops into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby can not be ruled out .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , and the random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and plas@@ tic@@ i@@ oma were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was specified concerning the inclusion of all events in which the reporting doctor held a connection with emet@@ ri@@ pen@@ xed and cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who were random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and tel@@ emet@@ ri@@ xed , included arr@@ hyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy . &quot;

&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who were random@@ ised to have tel@@ emet@@ ri@@ pen@@ xed arthritis , included sup@@ ra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as . &quot;
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the phase 2 of the summari@@ zed results of three different emet@@ ric mon@@ otherap@@ ies ( n = 164 ) compared to neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre@@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .

&quot; clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal disease , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) . &quot;
clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure in patients with refrac@@ tory treatment .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in endo@@ tom@@ ized mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .

ALI@@ M@@ TA ( emet@@ ri@@ mary ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by refra@@ ining important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
&quot; in vitro studies showed that tel@@ emet@@ ry acts as anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ es ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ logical fol@@ at@@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ amm@@ uni@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ amm@@ uni@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes in the de nov@@ o bi@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and purple @-@ nucle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of ALI@@ M@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin treated with chemotherapy with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that patients treated with cis@@ pl@@ atin were treated with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the all@@ ot@@ ted C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in improved lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in control .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ized , open Phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy had a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with patients treated with metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC ( Int@@ ent to treat populations n = 283 ) and from 7.9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favour of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 399 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for tel@@ emet@@ ry between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment is similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q Pop@@ ulation are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of ALI@@ M@@ TA cis@@ pl@@ atin in combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin .

solve the contents of the 500 mg dose bottles with 20 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de - injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ vatives which results in a solution with a conc@@ er@@ ration of about 25 mg / ml of tel@@ emet@@ ric fixed .
the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ing extends from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the product .
&quot; it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter , combined with low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they cannot cut down some fats in the diet , causing about a quarter of the fats led by the food to the intest@@ ines un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the two studies of patients with BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss .
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches at after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair @-@ pass , chair @-@ rang , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , clo@@ ck@@ ness o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; furthermore , it may not be applied in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) suffer , and in pregnant or breast @-@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ yp@@ ical and low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adol@@ escents under 18 because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
&quot; however , as Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ted , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • P@@ reg@@ n@@ ancy treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or fat diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic needs to be adapted if necessary . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medications for hyper@@ tension or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist to determine whether the dosage of these drugs has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
&quot; when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally normal ratio , IN@@ R ) may be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials of up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ine in the normal range remained . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be advised to take a supplementary Mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after applying a dispos@@ able dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a small decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of in@@ taken fat is prevented .
g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequency are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥
the frequency of known side effects found after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
+ It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to wor@@ sen@@ ing with regard to possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported on the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies in humans and animals , a rapid recovery of et@@ oric system@@ ic effects origin@@ ating from or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ cles properties can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect consists in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine rest of ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic le@@ agues .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ yp@@ ical , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months . &quot;
the average change in the Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; if you leave a meal or have a meal not a fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in connection with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutrition @-@ related symptoms ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to the new eating habits , start the first capsule collection with a cal@@ orie and low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
nutritional habits are effective as you can compreh@@ end what you eat and how much you eat and it will probably be easier for you to change your dietary habits .
&quot; to achieve your target weight , you should set two daily goals in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
eat fatty acids to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional symptoms ( see section 4 ) . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not acc@@ ust@@ omed to physical activity . • Stay during the intake and also after completion of the intake of all@@ i physically active .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain canc@@ ers • Cer@@ tain cancer • Cer@@ tain your health risk for these diseases .
&quot; lasting weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as indication on food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie supply indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
follow the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; please refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories , which is suitable for you . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional symptoms . • You should try to take gradual and continuous weight . &quot;
this reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie supply . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you can work on a daily basis of 150 k@@ cal , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gar@@ dening , or 2 km walking in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat goals and also comply with . • Re@@ ad@@ ful is a nutritional journal with indications of cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
the all@@ i programme to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; al@@ op@@ last@@ y is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ is can be increased by the additional donation of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine which can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is insufficient information about the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ onin ) , to recep@@ tors in the gut . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ is studied at 1 842 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong and moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ is ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit for Alo@@ xi based in the entire European Union to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . &quot;
Alo@@ is is inde@@ xed : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of a cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ is for the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thickness of the col@@ on , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ bab@@ y@@ 3 ant@@ ag@@ onists , caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with whom the Q@@ t interval is extended or who tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to other chemotherapy @-@ offering , Alo@@ is should not be used for prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bited the activity of the five investigated chemicals ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous administration of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , peri@@ od@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron experience in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 mc@@ g. ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who at least may be associated with al@@ op@@ xi , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the performance ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar abund@@ ances of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effectiveness ties observed .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective in case of al@@ op@@ i@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a severely em@@ powered chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials of indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the i@@ onal channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,25 , 0,75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
absorption After intraven@@ ous dosage follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration period curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg in patients and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ately .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentrations was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days overall exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which was measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg . however , the C@@ max after dispos@@ able of 0.75 mg was higher . &quot;
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites which have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; Eli@@ mination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g. / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
the total body volume of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although patients with severe liver dysfunction have increased the terminal elimination time and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified by this . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only following ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human@@ istic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies , indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion@@ isation , which can be involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver rot@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is considered low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this permit for placing on the market must inform the European Commission on the plans for issu@@ ing the medicine approved as part of this decision .

June 2006 the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the affir@@ mation of the permit for the treatment of hepatitis C provided by Al@@ ph@@ one@@ 6 million IE / ml Inj@@ ection Solution was recommended .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal constitu@@ ent ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also known as &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination the liver tissue damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme alan@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which stim@@ ulates these to the formation of the active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon placed data that prove the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients . &quot;
the study was measured how many patients were treated after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was adjusted ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be mark@@ eted do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of patients infected with hepatitis C related to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease again fl@@ ashes in more patients than in the reference drug ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , the test used in the study was to investigate the extent to which the drug trig@@ gers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanying with cr@@ ust formation ) and small in@@ contaminated Laz@@ er@@ ations , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which have been prov@@ ably or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go may not affect this type of infection . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients aged 9 months , but patients under 18 may not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was termin@@ ated at the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients in Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients in plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected home @-@ dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were examined at home @-@ dogs , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( stain@@ ed cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or from infections which have been prov@@ ably or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the surface .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ filtr@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. approval for the transportation of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined and considered alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of a sensi@@ tis@@ ation or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully bl@@ ur@@ red and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogens or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been reached in humans after top@@ ical use on scrat@@ ched skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant inhi@@ bition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 Accor@@ ding to simultaneous administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin level ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Oil on a separate skin of healthy adult men increased by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients dose adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement of effects on birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or termin@@ ates the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go is to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common adverse side effect of irrit@@ ation was at the meeting place , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ) . &quot;
the mode of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding points of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block some P @-@ binding Inter@@ actions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms seem question@@ able , a consultation should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in vitro activity of retin@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the case of non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
absorption In a healthy adult study 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Oil was applied daily including oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and lac@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Oil twice a day for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , maximum individual system@@ ic inclusion in people after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 separate skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP @-@ inhi@@ bition . &quot;
&quot; metabolism of the in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) performed over 14 days were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid . &quot;
in vitro investigation of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mice lymph@@ oma tests or in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro@@ kernel testing for in @-@ vi@@ vo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were neither male nor female rats indications of reduced fertility in oral dosage of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sec@@ lu@@ ded skin ) : &quot;
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats were observed in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 @-@ times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) ; development toxic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not explicitly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , on the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ int@@ ment is acci@@ dentally placed on one of these areas , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if dis@@ comfort occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile association or a Gaz@@ e@@ association unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area . &quot;

am@@ bition is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years which are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; am@@ bition is applied as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , am@@ bition may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , ensuring that the ino@@ cul@@ ation plan can be completed by two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is undes@@ irable for hepatitis A or B , am@@ eth@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines act by assi@@ sting the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defence ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; since 1996 , Ambi@@ rix has the same components as the approved vaccine , Twin@@ rix adults , and has been approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ nes and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as proof for the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix had a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of Ambi@@ rix protection was similar to a six and a 12 month distance between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ edness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix throughout the whole world . &quot;
the standardi@@ zation plan for the pri@@ mer uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines with the first dose on the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
&quot; if a refres@@ her chim@@ ney is required for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet completely assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who responded to a hepatitis vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her chim@@ ney as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As for all injection sim@@ ul@@ ants , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine , appropriate methods of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; with hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , after pri@@ ming under certain circumstances no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels are achieved so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal result in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disturb@@ ances , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
&quot; the inci@@ dence of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ iness , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever were similar to the frequency that was observed in the earlier thi@@ om@@ ano@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the tolerance of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ri@@ dity on a basis of calculation per vacc@@ ination dose , but not on a basis of calculation per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of subjects compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects following the dosage of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine .
&quot; after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had been reported about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ri@@ age was comparable to per pro@@ p ( i.e. over the entire ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle with 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 36.@@ 2 % for the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ri@@ dity was low and comparable that was observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study for 1- to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ines , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the am@@ bition group was similar to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per trial , was reported . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses ine regim@@ en with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses ino@@ cul@@ ate with the combination vaccine containing 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ ines aged 1 to 15 years , ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99.@@ 1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the anti @-@ HB@@ s Servo conversion rates were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out in 12 to 15 year olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combinations of combinations with three dos@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; for the 289 people whose imm@@ unity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the dosage of the 3 @-@ tin vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical comparative study by 1 @-@ 11 year olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the ino@@ cul@@ ations received either a 2 @-@ doses ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme was demonstrated .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was similar to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccine .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the refres@@ her chim@@ ney of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined m@@ umps m@@ umps killing vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ ene conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing by eye on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus prior to admini@@ stering both vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin fail@@ ures , short@@ ness or swelling of the facial or tongue . if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . &quot;
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled admini@@ stering of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
with a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead it will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a viral hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and may give you / your child a vaccine against completion of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected for persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . if you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s immune system , or if you / your child sub@@ tract or undergo a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; am@@ bition can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take more medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) , or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given or has been planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ination has to be given with Ambi@@ rix at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as diverse limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix is pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , except it is imper@@ ative that they are vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
please inform your doctor if your child has shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; further side effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 inj@@ ected doses ) are reported : &quot;
&quot; these include locally restricted or extended fail@@ ures that can itch or bubble @-@ shaped , swelling of the eyes and the face , ag@@ grav@@ ated breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like complaints , including ch@@ ills , mus@@ cular and joint pain conv@@ ul@@ sions , di@@ zz@@ iness , mis@@ percep@@ tions such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant running , &quot; Multiple Sclerosis , diseases of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or movement ability of many body parts , severe head@@ ache and stiff@@ ness of neck , inter@@ ruption of normal cereb@@ ral functions &quot;
&quot; f@@ ain@@ ting inflammation of some blood vessels uncomfortable or disease feeling , loss of appetite , diarr@@ he@@ a and abdominal pain caused fatigue of liver dysfunction ( bru@@ ises ) , caused by loss of blood plat@@ el@@ et amount . &quot;
&quot; 23 In@@ form your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which since the initial approval of the first permit , the CH@@ MP represented the view that the value @-@ risk ratio for am@@ bition remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug is limited due to the small patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defects or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ aps is - split into several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed up under the food or administered over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the stomach in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose to the stomach of leading hose ) .
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since ammon@@ ium could not be compared with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ aps can also result in loss of appetite , a abnormal level of acid in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , fluid retention , r@@ ash , r@@ ash , r@@ ash , r@@ ash , r@@ ash , r@@ ash , r@@ ash , or loss of weight . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with mal@@ functions of the ure@@ a cycle were effectively prevented by high ammon@@ ia values .
am@@ mon@@ aps was approved in &apos; exceptional circumstances &apos; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval limited information about this drug .
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live days ) .
&quot; in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ ist form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests after the first months of life ) , there is an indication of the use if there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MON@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg , as well as adol@@ escents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
ar@@ gin@@ ine patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to get ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day . &quot;
endo@@ cr@@ ine tablets may not be administered with swal@@ lowing disorders because there is a risk for the emergence of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
&quot; each tablet from MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure can only be applied with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney disease . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ aboli@@ sm and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ O2 should be applied only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ 3.@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it was slow@@ ing down the ne@@ ural prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ E from MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ 3.@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ ISI ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient , which developed metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with a single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms begin with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed an intraven@@ ous dose of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound known through acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest@@ o form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ le@@ xi@@ ble and the disease itself led to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ ues within the first year of life .
&quot; due to hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first life month ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it occurred with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ yl alcohol deficiency ) , who recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which is con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine and phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine arises .
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate for so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous Meth@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
a phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was det@@ ectable after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the following morning after night fasting .
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kid@@ neys within 24 hours of approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans were not toxic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ ISI gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , who cannot yet swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg , as well as adol@@ escents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat needs were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) before birth , there were l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ ISI ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient , which developed metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess , &quot;
&quot; on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen is produced for each gram . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot;
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ ata form measured 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MON@@ PS may also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot secre@@ te the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory investigations are carried out , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ 3 from MONA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory investigations . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently even if it is not prescription drug .
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you are not allowed to take AM@@ O2 since the medicine may go into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; rare cases also observed confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , ob@@ struction of the body , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or contact your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten your dose , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; you are not allowed to use any of the data from MONA@@ CO@@ D , after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date stated on the box and the container after &quot; &quot; Us@@ able up to &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; like AM@@ 3.@@ PS , and contents of the package of MONA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory investigations are carried out , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ 3 from MONA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory investigations . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently even if it is not prescription drug .
you should take AM@@ 3.@@ PS in the same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c bra@@ id ( hose which runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is led through the nose to the stomach ) .
&quot; • Rem@@ ove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spo@@ on gran@@ ules . • App@@ ly a straight edge , e.g. a knife press over the top of the knife , to remove surplus gran@@ ulate . • Un@@ load the recommended amount of measuring spo@@ on gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , e.g. in case of un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength@@ es ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; st@@ - lift &quot; &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on AC@@ S treatment , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery in order to prevent closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a donation from GP@@ I - was as effective after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who have gone to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy ble@@ edings , in which it was much more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other brain or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it should not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during one PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval of An@@ gi@@ ox in the European Union by The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ range inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned .
the recommended dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is subsequently conducted in another sequence , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be added and the inf@@ usion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bol@@ us@@ set of 0.5 mg / kg will be administered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ cation of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ ot@@ ted bol@@ us administration of An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) shor@@ tened to under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us@@ cation of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be eff@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ formed and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before applying and the bol@@ us dosage is administered rapidly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is given properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rates of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose dose is to be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular heat par@@ in .
• severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in case of PCI @-@ patients with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , most bleeding in arter@@ ial points occur can occur in patients suffering from a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment generally occurs everywhere bleeding . &quot;
patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine should consider a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ul@@ ant R@@ atio ) in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is again achieved prior to the treatment .
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ag@@ greg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , these substances can increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ag@@ gregation or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants is to regularly check the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters .
&quot; experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in the point area , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ alisation , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following data about side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with 6000 patients under@@ going a PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above were reported after extensive use in practice and are classified according to system organ classes in table 6 .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ at inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and the anim@@ on@@ enb@@ ind@@ le region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is present in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; binding from the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , whereby the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din showed no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mb@@ lo@@ sis of thro@@ mb@@ lo@@ sis ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was conducted in the following cases , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the inf@@ usion is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ range inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or either from the beginning of angi@@ ography or at the PCI .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adol@@ escents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or upper arm or administered as a permanent inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for controlling the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or unable to process insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ insulin is very slightly different from insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in the application in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults in type 2 diabetes in which the body can &apos;t work effectively .
the main indicator for efficacy was to change the concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in the comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , decreased H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,30 % with human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ lu@@ c@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the marketing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or delta or sub@@ cut@@ aneous via continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the abdominal cavity . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin need to be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method may change the insulin need . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or termination of treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict doctor supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in changing the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood glucose activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in , fibr@@ ate , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ous , sal@@ ic@@ y@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ etic agents such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ dine , gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation are weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between ingu@@ inal and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin @-@ lu@@ c@@ ine occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not interfere with breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ted after oral application . &quot;
&quot; the following are listed from clinical trials , group@@ ed after system organic classes and sorted by decre@@ asing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely

&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which are given by a su@@ itably trained person , or administered by a doctor through intraven@@ ous dosage of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after having glu@@ cos@@ in@@ jek@@ tion , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar epis@@ odes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the periph@@ eral glucose intake ( especially due to skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the inhi@@ bition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous levels of insulin release the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with a normal insulin analog .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years , type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus exhibited insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , a disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate increase of glucose @-@ giving effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin @-@ insulin has a twice as fast action as normal human insulin and achieves complete glucose @-@ giving effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; from the data it was evident that in an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ id 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ lu@@ id was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin @-@ lu@@ id is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved like with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - n@@ utes before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin @-@ insulin inj@@ ector given 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the meal was started ( Fi@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to normal normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
