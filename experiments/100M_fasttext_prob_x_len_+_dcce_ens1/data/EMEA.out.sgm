<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report (EPAR) in which the study evaluated how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the trials conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package supplement (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR)."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as a solution for inhalation (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. vortex thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not present), distrust and madness; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal mood) alternating with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for preventing manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioral malfunctions if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">The dose of Abilify should be adjusted to patients who take other medicines at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among themselves."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazl probably appears mainly as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripivorzol is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripivorzol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar illnesses related to increased disquietness over a period of two hours with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased disquietness, with that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for taking (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients receiving Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short-term studies than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms induced restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for inhalation (observing from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled swallowing), somnolence (drowsiness), sedation (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder, and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripivorzol, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"moreover, the Committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia."</seg>
<seg id="27">"June 2004, the European Commission granted the approval of Abilify in the entire European Union to the company Ottka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and their manic episodes (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of abilify in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors can justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the start or after replacement of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazl (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no elevated risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, conductive disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if symptoms and symptoms of a late dyskinesia occur in a patient with abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a MNS or has unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at conditions associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with aripiprazole in patients with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole had an increased risk of dying than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with aripivorous patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with respect to the deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy liveliness observed and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary efficacy of aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting drugs with self-lagging side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption ratio of aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC by Aripiprazl by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole results in the comparison with CYP2D6 extensive metabolism."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one considers the joint administration of ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteashibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after settling the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of abilify should be increased to dose level prior to the commencement of the escort therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">"diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with abilify, can be expected with a moderate increase in aripiprazole concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of aripiprazl per day did not show a significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextrophic orphic / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio.), 2C19 (omeprazorphic) and 3A4 (dextrophic)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data storage, and because of the concerns that arise in animal reproductive studies, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to operate until they are certain that Aripiprazl has no negative impact on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazl showed a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with semi-operidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with Olanzapine therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">Some episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients with aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under semi-operidol treatment.</seg>

<seg id="68">"in the long-term preservation phase for 26 weeks in placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients was treated with aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="69">There were no medically significant differences between the patient groups on aripiprazole and placebo in which potential clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters were observed.</seg>
<seg id="70">"increase of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3,5% of patients treated with aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"adverse Cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the introduction of the market, unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with aripiprazl alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hematalysis is useful in the treatment of overdosing, since Aripiprazole has a high plasma cutting capability."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripivorzol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I-disorder via the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine 2 and serotonin 5bab2a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5bab2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripivorzol showed a high affinity to dopamine dopamine and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin, 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergics and to histamine H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11c Racloprid, an D2 / D3-receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and the putstream."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a half-operidol-controlled study, 52% of responder patients who had a response to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"the current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- Depressions-rates scale, showed a significantly greater improvement than with haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the rate of recurrence occurred at 34% in the aripiprazole group and 57% among placebo."</seg>

<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazl showed an effective efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study, over 3 weeks with a fixed dose involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripivorzol showed a efficacy in week 3 and an effect effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripiprazl also showed 12 a comparable percentage of patients with symptomatic remission of the management like lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in part did not affect lithium- or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirror, the companion therapy with Aripivorzol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expiration period of more than 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation stage before randomization, especially in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyylation of aripiprazole, the N-dealkyulation is catalysed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean clearance time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl in extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazl, there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific evaluation on pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function of Aripiprazl and Dehydro Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproducibility, genotoxicity and the channel-balanced potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular hazards for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchycin cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, Cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxylic metabolites of Aripiprazl in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- aripiprazole were no more than 6% of concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys, and are far below limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility."</seg>

<seg id="149">"if parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution, patients should be observed in extreme sedation or blood pressure drops (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">"aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, conductive disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="152">"late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment."</seg>
<seg id="153">"clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and heart rhythm disorders)."</seg>
<seg id="154">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with respect to the deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="155">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar deficiency, due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to severe complications."</seg>
<seg id="156">"nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared with the intramuscularly study in the healthy volunteers" "Aripiprazl" "(15 mg dose) and which at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly."</seg>
<seg id="157">"105 The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption ratio of aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="158">"in addition to CYP2D6" bad "(=" poor ") metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="159">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- Proteaseinhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="160">"after settling the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of abilify should be increased to dose level prior to the commencement of the escort therapy."</seg>
<seg id="161">"106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared with that after allotted Gabe from Aripiprazole."</seg>

<seg id="172">"in a placebo-controlled short term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder and agility and behavioural disturbances, the aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms with regard to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam reference arm."</seg>
<seg id="173">"the observed average improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazl."</seg>
<seg id="174">"in analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed in terms of the overall population, but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced number of patients."</seg>
<seg id="175">"in three placebo-controlled short term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with sulfonyharnane or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyharnhydrogen and insulin can be retained with the beginning of the treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, thereby allowing type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received either actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels have been reduced when using doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional contribution of Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonytic dye resulted in a reduction of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional donation of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study that investigates the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had decreased the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who additionally took placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypocristhesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos may not be used for patients who may react sensitively (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, or in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid level - in the blood)."</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin for patients in which metformin is not displayed.</seg>

<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>

<seg id="796">"in the ProActive study over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occured at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication."</seg>
<seg id="797">"when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not have any symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="798">"pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated Receptor-γ), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat, and skeletal muscle cells."</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose utilisation in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as monotherapy was continued over two years in order to evaluate the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients suffering from gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">"in a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was not sufficiently regulated despite three months of optimization with insulin, were randomised to Pioglitazone or placebo."</seg>

<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of generic drugs used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">"generic Agenera is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic reinforcer Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefit of generic drugs in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not have protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"generic Agenera was originally approved in" "extraordinary circumstances", "since only limited information was available for scientific reasons at the time of approval."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"in October 2000, the European Commission issued Glaxo Group Limited approval for the transit of asylum in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"generic Ageneris is used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infected, proteasehemants (PI) -pretreated adults and children from 4 years."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"usually, asgenerase capsules are to be administered to the pharmacokinetic booster of amprenavir along with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from amprenavir as a capsule; therefore Agenerase capsules and solution for inserting on a milligram per milligram are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 600 mg of amprenor twice daily along with 100 mritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of kritonavir (booster), higher doses must be applied to veins (1200 mg twice daily)."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amprenor / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amperavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">"the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of generic gases in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"generic term is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data for reliability and efficacy (see section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"simultaneous application should be performed with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients suffering from severe liver dysfunction (see section 4.3)."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"generic Agenera must not be used simultaneously with medicines, which have a small therapeutic width and are also substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoroundworm 3A4 (CYP3A4)."</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations which contain St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenera or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with asgenera does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>

<seg id="1958">"although a multifactorial hertiology is believed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART)."</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenera must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoroundworm 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerasis with kritonavir may not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolized mainly via CYP2D6 and for increased plasma levels associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>

<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenor in plasma that were achieved twice daily in the combination of amprenor (600 mg twice daily) with kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">"dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended a close-meshed monitoring since the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known."</seg>
<seg id="1971">"no pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosine in combination with Didanosin, however, due to the sacroscidal component of Didanosin, it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below)."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) there is no dosage adjustment necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with favirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure to both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapine to other proteasehemfers and existing limited data suggest that nevirapine possibly lowers the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">"should these drugs be used at the same time, caution is advised, since Delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"if these drugs are used together, caution is recommended; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenor and kritonavir on delavirdin is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenor and Rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentrations (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">"if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with agitase, a reduction of the dosage of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this."</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with generic drugs in combination with erythromycin were not performed but could increase the plasma levels of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole with 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2.69times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"other drugs listed below including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can potentially lead to interactions."</seg>
<seg id="1982">"therefore, patients should be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with generic drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1983">"based on data from other proteasehemfers, it is advisable that antacids cannot be taken at the same time as asgenerase, since it can occur to resorption disorders."</seg>
<seg id="1984">"the simultaneous application of anti-convulants known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir."</seg>

<seg id="1987">"in a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days of subjects, fluorticasonpropionate plasma levels rose by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%)."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"consequently, the simultaneous gift of asgenera with kritonavir together with these glucocorticosteroids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1989">"for HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is highly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in the plasma levels are expected to be administered at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors lead to Myopathy, including a habdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended."</seg>
<seg id="1991">"it is recommended to monitor the therapeutic concentrations to stabilize the mirror, since the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with the simultaneous offering of amperavir (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1992">"therefore, agenera must not be applied together with the orally taken Midazolam (see section 4.3), while still careful with parenteral midazolam."</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteashibitors point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">"if methadon is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given, as amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"in the case of simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with againase, an increased control of INR (International Regulant Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or amplifying the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"the effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are recommended."</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for simultaneous use of generic term (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbundled generic term is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children between the ages of 2 and 18 years of which 152 were pretreated with PI.</seg>

<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">"approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on ACS treatment, in which the effect of Angiox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent blood clots) and a GPI."</seg>
